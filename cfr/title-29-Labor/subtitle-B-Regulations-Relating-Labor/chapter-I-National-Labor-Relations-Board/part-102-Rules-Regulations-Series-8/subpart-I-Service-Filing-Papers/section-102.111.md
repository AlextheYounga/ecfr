##### § 102.111 Time computation. #####

(a) In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, the day of the act, event, or default after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the period runs until the official closing time of the receiving office on the next Agency business day (see appendix A to this part 102 setting forth the official business hours of the Agency's several offices). When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays shall be excluded in the computation.

(b) When the Act or any of these rules require the filing of a motion, brief, exception, or other paper in any proceeding, such document must be received by the Board or the officer or agent designated to receive such matter before the official closing time of the receiving office on the last day of the time limit, if any, for such filing or extension of time that may have been granted (see appendix A to the part 102 setting forth the official business hours of the Agency's several offices). A request for an extension of time to file a document shall be filed no later than the official closing time of the receiving office on the date on which the document is due. Requests for extensions of time filed within three days of the due date must be grounded upon circumstances not reasonably foreseeable in advance. In construing this section of the rules, the Board will accept as timely filed any document which is hand delivered to the Board on or before the official closing time of the receiving office on the due date or postmarked on the day before (or earlier than) the due date; documents which are postmarked on or after the due date are untimely. “Postmarking” shall include timely depositing the document with a delivery service that will provide a record showing that the document was tendered to the delivery service in sufficient time for delivery by the due date, but in no event later than the day before the due date. *Provided, however,* The following documents must be received on or before the official closing time of the receiving office on the last day for filing:

(1) Charges filed pursuant to section 10(b) of the Act (see also § 102.14).

(2) Applications for awards and fees and other expenses under the Equal Access to Justice Act.

(3) Petitions to revoke subpoenas.

(4) Requests for extensions of time to file any document for which such an extension may be granted.

(c) The following documents may be filed within a reasonable time after the time prescribed by these rules only upon good cause shown based on excusable neglect and when no undue prejudice would result:

(1) In unfair labor practice proceedings, motions, exceptions, answers to a complaint or a backpay specification, and briefs; and

(2) In representation proceedings, exceptions, requests for review, motions, briefs, and any responses to any of these documents. A party seeking to file such documents beyond the time prescribed by these rules shall file, along with the document, a motion that states the grounds relied on for requesting permission to file untimely. The specific facts relied on to support the motion shall be set forth in affidavit form and sworn to by individuals with personal knowledge of the facts. The time for filing any document responding to the untimely document shall not commence until the date a ruling issues accepting the untimely document. In addition, cross-exceptions shall be due within 14 days, or such further period as the Board may allow, from the date a ruling issues accepting the untimely filed documents.
