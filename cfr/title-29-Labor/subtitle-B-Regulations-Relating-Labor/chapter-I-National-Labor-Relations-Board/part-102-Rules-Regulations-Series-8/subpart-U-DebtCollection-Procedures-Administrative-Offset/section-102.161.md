(a) The Agency shall send a written demand to the debtor in terms which inform the debtor of the consequences of failure to cooperate. In the demand letter, the Agency shall provide the name of an Agency employee who can provide a full explanation of the claim.

(1) Of the nature and amount of the Board's claim;

(2) Of the date by which payment is to be made (which normally should be not more than 30 days from the date that the initial notification was mailed or hand delivered);

(3) Of the Agency's intention to collect by administrative offset and of the debtor's rights in conjunction with such an offset;

(4) That the Agency intends to collect, as appropriate, interest, penalties, administrative costs and attorneys fees;

(5) Of the rights of such debtor to a full explanation of the claim, of the opportunity to inspect and copy Agency records with respect to the claim and to dispute any information in the Agency's records concerning the claim;

(6) Of the debtor's right to administrative appeal or review within the Agency concerning the Agency's claim and how such review shall be obtained;

(7) Of the debtor's opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the Agency to repay the debt; and

(8) Of the date on which, or after which, an administrative offset will begin.
