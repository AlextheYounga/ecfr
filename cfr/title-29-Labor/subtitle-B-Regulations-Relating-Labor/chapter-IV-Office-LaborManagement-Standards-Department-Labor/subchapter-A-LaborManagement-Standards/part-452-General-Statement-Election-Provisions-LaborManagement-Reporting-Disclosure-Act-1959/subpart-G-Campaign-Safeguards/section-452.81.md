##### § 452.81 Rights in intermediate body elections. #####

While the literal language in section 401(c) relating to distribution of campaign literature and to discrimination with respect to the use of membership lists would seem to apply only to national, international and local labor organizations, two United States District Courts have held that these provisions also apply to intermediate bodies. 42 The Department of Labor considers these rulings to be consistent with the intent of Congress and, therefore, has adopted this position.
