##### § 452.11 Organizations to which election provisions apply. #####

Title IV of the Act contains election provisions applicable to national and international labor organizations, except federations of such organizations, to intermediate bodies such as general committees, conferences, system boards, joint boards, or joint councils, certain districts, district councils and similar organizations and to local labor organizations.11/\> The provisions do not apply to State and local central bodies, which are explicitly excluded from the definition of “labor organization”.12/\> The characterization of a particular organizational unit as a “local,” “intermediate,” etc., is determined by its functions and purposes rather than the formal title by which it is known or how it classifies itself.

11 For the scope of the term “labor organization,” see part 451 of this chapter.

12 See § 451.5 of this chapter for a definition of “State or local central body.”
