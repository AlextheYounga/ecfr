##### ยง 1404.17 Policy. #####

In an effort to reduce the time and expense of some grievance arbitrations, FMCS offers expedited procedures that may be appropriate in certain non-precedential cases or those that do not involve complex or unique issues. Expedited arbitration is intended to be a mutually agreed-upon process whereby arbitrator appointments, hearings and awards are acted upon quickly by the parties, FMCS, and the arbitrators. Mandating short deadlines and eliminating requirements for transcripts, briefs and lengthy opinions streamline the process.
