##### ยง 1404.15 Fees and charges of arbitrators. #####

(a) Fees to Parties. Prior to appointment, the parties should be aware of all significant aspects of the bases for an arbitrator's fees and expenses. Each arbitrator's biographical sketch shall include a statement of the bases for the arbitrator's fees and expenses, which shall conform to this part and the Code. The parties and the arbitrator shall be bound by the arbitrator's statement of the bases for fees and expenses in the biographical sketch unless they mutually agree otherwise in writing. Arbitrators listed on the Roster may change the bases for their fees and expenses if they provide them in writing to OAS at least 30 days in advance.

(b) Dual Addresses. Arbitrators with dual business addresses must bill the parties for expenses from the lesser expensive business address to the hearing site.

(c) Additional Administrative Fee. In cases involving unusual amounts of time and expense relative to the pre-hearing and post-hearing administration of a particular case, the arbitrator may charge an administrative fee. This fee shall be disclosed to the parties as soon as it is foreseeable by the arbitrator.

(d) Fee Disputes. The OAS requests that it be notified of an arbitrator's deviation from this Part. While the OAS does not resolve individual fee disputes, repeated complaints concerning the fees charged by an arbitrator will be brought to the attention of the Board for consideration. Similarly, complaints by arbitrators concerning non-payment of fees by the parties may lead to the denial of services or other actions by the OAS.
