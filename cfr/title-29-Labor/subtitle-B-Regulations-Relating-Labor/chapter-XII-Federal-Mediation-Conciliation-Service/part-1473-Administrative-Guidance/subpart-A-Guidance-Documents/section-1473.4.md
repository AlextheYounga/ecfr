##### § 1473.4 Requirements for clearance. #####

The Service's review and clearance of guidance shall ensure that each guidance document proposed to be issued by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service satisfies the following requirements:

(a) The guidance document complies with all relevant statutes and regulation (including any statutory deadlines for agency action);

(b) The guidance document identifies or includes:

(1) The term “guidance” or its functional equivalent;

(2) A concise name for the guidance document;

(3) The issuing department;

(4) A unique identifier, including, at a minimum, the date of issuance, title of the document, and a number assigned by the Office of General Counsel (or, in the case of a significant guidance document, the Z-RIN (regulation identifier number));

(5) The general topic addressed by the guidance document;

(6) Citations to applicable statutes and regulations;

(7) A statement noting whether the guidance is intended to revise or replace any previously issued guidance and, if so, sufficient information to identify the previously issued guidance; and

(8) A concise summary of the guidance document's content;

(c) The guidance document avoids using mandatory language, such as “shall,” “must,” “required,” or “requirement,” unless the language is describing an established statutory or regulatory requirement or is addressed to Service staff and will not foreclose the Service's consideration of positions advanced by affected private parties;

(d) The guidance document is written in plain and understandable English; and

(e) All guidance documents include the following disclaimer prominently: “The contents of this document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way. This document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies.” When an agency's guidance document is binding because guidance is authorized by law or because the guidance is incorporated into a contract, the agency should modify this disclaimer to reflect either of those facts.
