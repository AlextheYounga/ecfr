##### ยง 1473.7 Good faith cost estimates. #####

Even though not legally binding, some agency guidance may result in a substantial economic impact. For example, the issuance of agency guidance may induce private parties to alter their conduct to conform to recommended standards or practices, thereby incurring costs beyond the costs of complying with existing statutes and regulations. While it may be difficult to predict with precision the economic impact of voluntary guidance, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) shall, to the extent practicable, make a good faith effort to estimate the likely economic cost impact of the guidance document to determine whether the document might be significant. When FMCS is assessing or explaining whether it believes a guidance document is significant, it shall, at a minimum, provide the same level of analysis that is required for a major determination under the Congressional Review Act.1 When FMCS, in consultation with OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), determines that a guidance document will be economically significant, FMCS will conduct and publish a Regulatory Impact Analysis of the sort that would accompany an economically significant rulemaking, to the extent reasonably possible.
