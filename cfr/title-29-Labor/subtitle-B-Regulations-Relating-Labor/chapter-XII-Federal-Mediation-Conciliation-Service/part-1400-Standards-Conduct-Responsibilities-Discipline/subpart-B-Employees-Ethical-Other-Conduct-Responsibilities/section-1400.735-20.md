Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 4728, Jan. 25, 2023.

In 1964, a Code of Professional Conduct for Labor Mediators was drafted by a Federal-State Liaison Committee and approved by the Service and the Association of Labor Mediation Agencies at its annual meeting. It is expected that mediators in the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will make themselves familiar with this Code and will conduct themselves in accordance with the responsibilities outlined therein. The complete narrative of the Code appears in the appendix to this part.
