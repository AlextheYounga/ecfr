##### ยง 4901.17 Exhaustion of administrative remedies. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 43996, July 25, 2022.

If the disclosure officer fails to make a determination to grant or deny access to requested records, or the General Counsel does not make a decision on appeal from a denial of access to PBGC records, within the time prescribed (including any extension) for making such determination or decision, the requester's administrative remedies shall be deemed exhausted and the requester may apply for judicial relief under FOIA. However, since a court may allow the PBGC additional time to act as provided in FOIA, processing of the request or appeal shall continue and the requester shall be so advised.
