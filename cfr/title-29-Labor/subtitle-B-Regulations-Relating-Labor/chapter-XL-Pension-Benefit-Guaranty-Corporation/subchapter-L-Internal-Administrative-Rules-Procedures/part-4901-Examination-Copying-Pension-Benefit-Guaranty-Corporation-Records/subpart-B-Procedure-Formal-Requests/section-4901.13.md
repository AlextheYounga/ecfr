The disclosure officer shall note the date and time of receipt on each request for access to records. A request shall be deemed received and the period within which action on the request shall be taken, as set forth in § 4901.14 of this part, shall begin on the next business day following such date, except that a request shall be deemed received only if and when the PBGC receives -

(a) A sufficient description under § 4901.12;

(b) Payment or assurance of payment if required under § 4901.33(b); and

(c) The requester's consent to pay substantial search, review, and/or duplication charges under subpart D of this part if the PBGC determines that such charges may be substantial and so notifies the requester. Consent may be in the form of a statement that costs under subpart D will be acceptable either in any amount or up to a specified amount. To avoid possible delay, a requester may include such a statement in a request.
