##### ยง 4901.23 Record of concern to more than one agency. #####

If the release of a record in the custody of the PBGC would be of concern not only to the PBGC but also to another Federal agency, the record will be made available by the PBGC only if its interest in the record is the primary interest and only after coordination with the other interested agency. If the interest of the PBGC in the record is not primary, the request will be transferred promptly to the agency having the primary interest, and the requester will be so notified.
