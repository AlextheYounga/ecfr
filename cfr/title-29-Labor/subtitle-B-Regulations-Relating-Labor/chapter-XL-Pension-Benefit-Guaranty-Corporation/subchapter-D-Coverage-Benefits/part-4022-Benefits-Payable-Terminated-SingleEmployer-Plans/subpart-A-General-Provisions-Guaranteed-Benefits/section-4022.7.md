##### § 4022.7 Benefits payable in a single installment. #####

(a) *Alternative benefit.* If a benefit that is guaranteed under this part is payable in a single installment or substantially so under the terms of the plan, or an option elected under the plan by the participant, the benefit will not be guaranteed or paid as such, but the PBGC will guarantee the alternative benefit, if any, in the plan which provides for the payment of equal periodic installments for the life of the recipient. If the plan provides more than one such annuity, the recipient may within 30 days after notification of the proposed termination of the plan elect to receive one of those annuities. If the plan does not provide such an annuity, the PBGC will guarantee an actuarially equivalent life annuity.

(b)(1) *Payment in lump sum.* Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section:

(i) *In general.* If the lump sum value of a benefit (or of an estimated benefit) payable by the PBGC is $5,000 or less and the benefit is not yet in pay status, the benefit (or estimated benefit) may be paid in a lump sum.

(ii) *Annuity option.* If the PBGC would otherwise make a lump sum payment in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and the monthly benefit (or the estimated monthly benefit) is equal to or greater than $25 (at normal retirement age and in the normal form for an unmarried participant), the PBGC will provide the option to receive the benefit in the form of an annuity.

(iii) *Election of QPSA lump sum.* If the lump sum value of annuity payments under a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (or under an estimated qualified preretirement survivor annuity) is $5,000 or less, the benefit is not yet in pay status, and the participant dies after the termination date, the benefit (or estimated benefit) may be paid in a lump sum if so elected by the surviving spouse.

(iv) *Payments to estates.* The PBGC may pay any annuity payments payable to an estate in a single installment without regard to the threshold in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section if so elected by the estate. The PBGC will discount the annuity payments using the federal mid-term rate (as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to section 1274(d)(1)(C)(ii) of the Code) applicable for the month the participant died based on monthly compounding.

(2) *Return of employee contributions*—(i) *General.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, the PBGC may pay in a single installment (or a series of installments) instead of as an annuity, the value of the portion of an individual's basic-type benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions, if:

(A) The individual elects payment in a single installment (or a series of installments) before the sixty-first (61st) day after the date he or she receives notice that such an election is available; and

(B) Payment in a single installment (or a series of installments) is consistent with the plan's provisions. For purposes of this part, the portion of an individual's basic-type benefit derived from mandatory employee contributions is determined under § 4044.12 (priority category 2 benefits) of this chapter, and the value of that portion is computed under the applicable rules contained in part 4044, subpart B, of this chapter.

(ii) *Set-off for distributions after termination.* The amount to be returned under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is reduced by the set-off amount. The set-off amount is the amount by which distributions made to the individual after the termination date exceed the amount that would have been distributed, exclusive of mandatory employee contributions, if the individual had withdrawn the mandatory employee contributions on the termination date.

Example:Participant A is receiving a benefit of $600 per month when the plan terminates, $200 of which is derived from mandatory employee contributions. If the participant had withdrawn his contributions on the termination date, his benefit would have been reduced to $400 per month. The participant receives two monthly payments after the termination date. The set-off amount is $400. (The $600 actual payment minus the $400 the participant would have received if he had withdrawn his contributions multiplied by the two months for which he received the extra payment.)

(iii) *Rollover amounts.* The rule in paragraph (b)(2) of this section (dealing with return of employee contributions) does not apply to a participant's accumulated mandatory employee contributions resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12(c)(4)(i) of this chapter) or the benefit derived from such mandatory employee contributions.

(c) *Death benefits*—(1) *General.* Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a benefit that would otherwise be guaranteed under the provisions of this subpart, except for the fact that it is payable solely in a single installment (or substantially so) upon the death of a participant, shall be paid by the PBGC as an annuity that has the same value as the single installment. The PBGC will in each case determine the amount and duration of the annuity based on all the facts and circumstances.

(2) *Exception.* Except in the case of accumulated mandatory employee contributions resulting from rollover amounts (as determined under § 4044.12(c)(4)(i) of this chapter), upon the death of a participant the PBGC may pay in a single installment (or a series of installments) that portion of the participant's accumulated mandatory employee contributions that is payable under the plan in a single installment (or a series of installments) upon the participant's death.

(d) *Determination of lump sum amount.* For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section—

(1) *Benefits disregarded.* In determining whether the lump-sum value of a benefit is $5,000 or less, the PBGC may disregard the value of any benefits the plan or the PBGC previously paid in lump-sum form or the plan paid by purchasing an annuity contract, the value of any benefits returned under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and the value of any benefits the PBGC has not yet determined under section 4022(c) of ERISA.

(2) *Actuarial assumptions.* PBGC will calculate the lump sum value of a benefit by valuing the monthly annuity benefits payable in the form determined under § 4044.51(a) of this chapter and commencing at the time determined under § 4044.51(b) of this chapter. The actuarial assumptions used will be those described in § 4044.52 of this chapter, except as follows:

(i) *Loading for expenses.* There will be no adjustment to reflect the loading for expenses.

(ii) *Mortality assumption.* The “applicable mortality table” specified in section 205(g)(3)(B)(i) of ERISA and section 417(e)(3)(B) of the Code for the year containing the termination date will apply.

(iii) *Interest rate assumption.* The “applicable interest rate” specified in section 205(g)(3)(B)(ii) of ERISA and section 417(e)(3)(C) of the Code for the month containing the termination date will apply.

(iv) *Date for determining lump sum value.* The date as of which a lump sum value is calculated is the termination date, except that in the case of a subsequent insufficiency it is the date described in section 4062(b)(1)(B) of ERISA.

(e) *Private-sector lump sum rates.* PBGC provides lump sum interest rates for private-sector payments in appendix C to this part.
