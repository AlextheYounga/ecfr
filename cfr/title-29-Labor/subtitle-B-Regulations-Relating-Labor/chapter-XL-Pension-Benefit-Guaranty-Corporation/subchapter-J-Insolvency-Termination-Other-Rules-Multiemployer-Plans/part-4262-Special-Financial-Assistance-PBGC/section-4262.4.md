##### § 4262.4 Amount of special financial assistance. #####

(a) *In general.* Subject to paragraph (f) of this section, the amount of special financial assistance for a plan is the amount (if any), subject to adjustment for the date of payment as described in § 4262.12, by which -

(1) The value, as of the plan's SFA measurement date, of all SFA-eligible plan obligations; exceeds

(2) The value, as of the plan's SFA measurement date, of all SFA-eligible plan resources.

(b) *SFA-eligible plan obligations.* The value of SFA-eligible plan obligations as of the plan's SFA measurement date, is the sum of -

(1) The present value of benefits expected to be paid by the plan during the SFA coverage period including any reinstatement of benefits attributable to the elimination of reductions in a participant's or beneficiary's benefit due to a suspension of benefits under sections 305(e)(9) or 4245(a) of ERISA as required under § 4262.15 and any restoration of benefits under 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3), and assuming such reinstatements are paid beginning as of the SFA measurement date; and

(2) The present value of administrative expenses expected to be paid by the plan using plan assets during the SFA coverage period, excluding the amount owed to PBGC under section 4261 of ERISA (which is added to the amount of special financial assistance in § 4262.12 determined as of the date special financial assistance is paid).

(c) *SFA-eligible plan resources.* The value of SFA-eligible plan resources as of the plan's SFA measurement date, is the sum of -

(1) The fair market value of plan assets on the SFA measurement date; and

(2) The present value of future contributions, withdrawal liability payments, and other payments expected to be made to the plan (excluding the amount of financial assistance under section 4261 of ERISA and special financial assistance to be received by the plan) during the SFA coverage period.

(d) *Deterministic basis.* The projections in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) and (c)(2) of this section must be performed on a deterministic basis using a single set of assumptions as described in paragraph (e) of this section. The projections must be based on participant census data as of the first day of the plan year in which the plan's initial application for special financial assistance is filed, or, if the date on which the plan's initial application for special financial assistance is filed is less than 270 days after the beginning of the current plan year and the actuarial valuation for the current plan year is not complete, the projections may instead be based on the participant census data as of the first day of the plan year preceding the year in which the plan's initial application for special financial assistance is filed.

(e) *Actuarial assumptions.* The amount of special financial assistance must be determined in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices and the provisions in this paragraph (e).

(1) The assumed interest rate is the lesser of the rate in paragraph (e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

(i) The interest rate in this paragraph (e)(1)(i) is the interest rate used for funding standard account purposes as projected in the plan's most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021.

(ii) The interest rate in this paragraph (e)(1)(ii) is the interest rate that is 200 basis points higher than the rate specified in section 303(h)(2)(C)(iii) of ERISA (disregarding modifications made under clause (iv) of such section) for the month in which the plan's application for special financial assistance is filed or one of the 3 preceding months, as selected by the plan.

(2) The assumptions other than the interest rate are those used for the plan's most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions are unreasonable.

(3) If a plan determines that use of the assumptions under paragraph (e)(2) of this section is unreasonable, the plan's application may include a proposed change in the assumptions (excluding the plan's interest rate assumption under paragraph (e)(1) of this section), as described in § 4262.5.

(f) *Certain events* - (1) *General rules.* (i) The special financial assistance of a plan that experiences one or more of the events described in paragraphs (f)(2), (3), and (4) of this section during the period beginning on July 9, 2021, and ending on the SFA measurement date is limited to the amount of special financial assistance that would have applied to the plan on the SFA measurement date if the events had not occurred, as determined in a reasonable manner.

(ii) The special financial assistance of a plan that experiences a merger event during the period described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section is limited to the sum of the amounts of special financial assistance that would have applied to the plans involved in the merger on the SFA measurement date if the merger had not occurred, as determined in a reasonable manner. If any of the plans involved in the merger also experiences one or more of the events described in paragraph (f)(2), (3), or (4) of this section during the period described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the amount of special financial assistance for that plan on the SFA measurement date, determined as if the merger had not occurred, must be determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section.

(2) *Transfers.* The event described in this paragraph (f)(2) is a transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff).

(3) *Benefit increases.* The event described in this paragraph (f)(3) is the execution of a plan amendment increasing accrued or projected benefits under a plan, other than a restoration of suspended benefits that satisfies the requirements of 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3).

(4) *Contribution reductions.* The event described in this paragraph (f)(4) is the execution of a document reducing a plan's contribution rate (including any reduction in benefit accruals adopted simultaneously or arising from a pre-existing linkage between benefit accruals and contributions), but only if the plan does not demonstrate (in accordance with the special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at *www.pbgc.gov*) that the risk of loss to participants and beneficiaries is reduced (disregarding special financial assistance) by execution of the document. The document referred to in this paragraph (f)(4) is either -

(i) A collective bargaining agreement not rejected by the plan; or

(ii) A document reallocating contribution rates.

(5) *Effect of pre-event ineligibility.* In determining the amount of special financial assistance that would have applied to a plan if an event described in this paragraph (f) had not occurred, if the plan would have been ineligible for special financial assistance under § 4262.3 in the absence of the event, then the amount of special financial assistance is deemed to be $0 (zero).

(6) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.

(i) *Example 1.* Plan A applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section did not apply, Plan A would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $20X. Before the SFA measurement date, but on or after July 9, 2021, Plan A transferred a portion of its assets and liabilities to Plan B. If the transfer had not occurred, Plan A would, as of the SFA measurement date, be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $40X. Although an event described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section occurred with respect to Plan A, Plan A's special financial assistance is unaffected by the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and is $20X. Plan B also applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section did not apply, Plan B would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $30X. If the transfer from Plan A had not occurred, Plan B would, as of the SFA measurement date, be ineligible for special financial assistance. As a result of the event described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section reduces Plan B's special financial assistance from $30X to $0.

(ii) *Example 2.* Plan C applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section did not apply, Plan C would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $40X. Before the SFA measurement date, but on or after July 9, 2021, Plans A and B were merged into existing Plan C. If the mergers had not occurred, Plan A would not be eligible for special financial assistance, and Plan B and Plan C would be entitled, respectively, to $10X and $5X of special financial assistance as of the SFA measurement date. As a result of the merger event described in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section reduces Plan C's special financial assistance from $40X to $15X.

(iii) *Example 3.* Plan A applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section did not apply, Plan A would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $10X. Before the SFA measurement date, but on or after July 9, 2021, projected benefits under Plan A were increased. If the increase had not occurred, Plan A would, as of the SFA measurement date, be ineligible for special financial assistance. As a result of the event described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, applying the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section and in accordance with paragraph (f)(5) of this section, Plan A is treated as being entitled to special financial assistance of $0.

(iv) *Example 4.* Plan A applies for special financial assistance. If the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section did not apply, Plan A would be entitled to special financial assistance in the amount of $10X. Before the SFA measurement date, but on or after July 9, 2021, Plan A's contribution rate was reduced. Plan A's benefit formula states that the monthly benefit accrual for a participant for a plan year is 2.0% of the contributions paid on behalf of the participant for that plan year. Since there is a pre-existing linkage between benefit accruals and contributions, the event described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section includes both the reduction in benefit accruals and the reduction in the contribution rate. If the contribution rate reduction and the reduction in benefit accruals had not occurred, Plan A would, as of the SFA measurement date, be entitled to special financial assistance of $8X. Plan A does not provide a demonstration that the risk of loss to participants and beneficiaries is reduced (disregarding special financial assistance) due to the reduction in contribution rate and the reduction in benefit accruals. As a result of the events described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the limitation in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section reduces Plan A's special financial assistance from $10X to $8X.
