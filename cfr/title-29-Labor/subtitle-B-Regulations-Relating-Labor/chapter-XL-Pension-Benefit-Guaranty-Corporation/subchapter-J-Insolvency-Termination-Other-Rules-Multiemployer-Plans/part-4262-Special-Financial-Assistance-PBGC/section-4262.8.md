(ii) Fair market value of plan assets determined as of the SFA measurement date; a certification from the plan sponsor with respect to the accuracy of this amount, including information that substantiates the asset value and any projections to the SFA measurement date (including details and supporting rationale); and a reconciliation of the fair market value of plan assets from the date of the most recent plan financial statement to the SFA measurement date showing contributions, withdrawal liability payments, benefit payments, administrative expenses, and investment income.

(iii) Special financial assistance determined as a lump sum as of the SFA measurement date.

(v) For each plan year in the SFA coverage period: Benefit payments described in § 4262.4(b)(1) attributable to the reinstatement of benefits under § 4262.15 that were previously suspended through the SFA measurement date and any benefits restored under 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3).

For withdrawal liability, separate projections for withdrawn employers and for future assumed withdrawals.

(7) For a plan that has 350,000 or more participants reported on line 6f of its most recently filed Form 5500, the participant census data utilized by the plan actuary in developing the cash flow projections included in the application.

(b) *Information required for changed assumptions.* An application for a plan that proposes to change any assumption used in the plan's most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, must include all of the following information:

(1) A table identifying which assumptions used in demonstrating the plan's eligibility for special financial assistance or in calculating the amount of special financial assistance differ from those assumptions used in the plan's most recently completed certification of plan status before January 1, 2021, and detailed narrative explanations (with supporting rationale and information) as to why any assumption used in the certification is no longer reasonable and why the changed assumption is reasonable.

(2) Deterministic cash flow projection (“Baseline”) in accordance with the special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at *www.pbgc.gov* that shows the amount of special financial assistance that would be determined if all underlying assumptions used in the projection were the same as those used in the actuarial certification of plan status last completed before January 1, 2021 (excluding the plan's interest rate, which must be the same as the interest rate required under § 4262.4(e)(1)). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2), certain changes in assumptions as described in the special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at *www.pbgc.gov* should be reflected in the Baseline projection.

(3) In accordance with the special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at *www.pbgc.gov,* a reconciliation of the change in the requested special financial assistance due to each changed assumption from the Baseline to the requested special financial assistance amount in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section, showing, for each assumption change from the Baseline, a deterministic projection calculated in the same manner as the requested amount in § 4262.4.

(c) *Information required for certain events.* An application for a plan with respect to which an event described in § 4262.4(f) occurs on or after July 9, 2021, must include the applicable information related to the event specified in special financial assistance instructions on PBGC's website at *www.pbgc.gov*.
