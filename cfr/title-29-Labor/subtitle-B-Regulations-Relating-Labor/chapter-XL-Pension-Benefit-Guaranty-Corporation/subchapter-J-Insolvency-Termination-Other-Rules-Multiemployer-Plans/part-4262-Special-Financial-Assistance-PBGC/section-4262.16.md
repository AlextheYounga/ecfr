##### § 4262.16 Conditions for special financial assistance. #####

(a) *In general.* A plan that receives special financial assistance must be administered in accordance with the conditions in this section.

(b) *Benefit increases.* This paragraph (b) applies to benefits and benefit increases described in section 4022A(b)(1) of ERISA without regard to the time the benefit or benefit increase has been in effect. This paragraph (b) does not apply to the reinstatement of benefits that were suspended under sections 305(e)(9) or 4245(a) of ERISA (as provided under § 4262.15) or a restoration of benefits under 26 CFR 1.432(e)(9)-1(e)(3).

(1) *Retrospective.* A benefit or benefit increase must not be adopted during the SFA coverage period if it is in whole or in part attributable to service accrued or other events occurring before the adoption date of the amendment.

(2) *Prospective.* A benefit or benefit increase must not be adopted during the SFA coverage period unless -

(i) The plan actuary certifies that employer contribution increases projected to be sufficient to pay for the benefit increase have been adopted or agreed to; and

(ii) Those increased contributions were not included in the determination of the special financial assistance.

(c) *Allocation of plan assets.* During the SFA coverage period, plan assets, including special financial assistance, must be invested in permissible investments as described in § 4262.14 sufficient to pay for at least 1 year (or until the date the plan is projected to become insolvent, if earlier) of projected benefit payments and administrative expenses.

(d) *Contribution decreases.* (1) During the SFA coverage period, the contributions to a plan that receives special financial assistance required for each contribution base unit must not be less than, and the definition of the contribution base units used must not be different from, those set forth in collective bargaining agreements or plan documents (including contribution increases to the end of the collective bargaining agreements) in effect on March 11, 2021, unless the plan sponsor determines that the change lessens the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries and, if the contribution reduction affects annual contributions over $10 million and over 10 percent of all employer contributions, PBGC also determines that the change lessens the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries.

(2) A request for PBGC approval of a proposed contribution change that affects annual contributions over $10 million and over 10 percent of all employer contributions must be submitted by the plan sponsor or its duly authorized representative and must contain all of the following information:

(E) State the estimated liquidation values for any assets related to discontinued operations or operations that are not expected to continue, along with the sources for the estimates.

(vi) Projected financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow statement) for the current year and the following 4 years as well as the key assumptions underlying those projections and a justification for the reasonableness for each of those key assumptions. The projections must include:

(e) *Allocating contributions and other practices.* During the SFA coverage period, a decrease in the proportion of income or an increase in the proportion of expenses allocated to a plan that receives special financial assistance pursuant to a written or oral agreement or practice (other than a written agreement in existence on March 11, 2021, to the extent not subsequently amended or modified) under which the income or expenses are divided or to be divided between a plan that receives special financial assistance and one or more other employee benefit plans is prohibited. The prohibition in the preceding sentence does not apply to a good faith allocation of:

(1) Contributions pursuant to a reciprocity agreement;

(2) Costs of securing shared space, goods, or services, where such allocation does not constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or is exempt from such prohibited transaction provisions pursuant to section 408(b)(2) or 408(c)(2) of ERISA, or pursuant to a specific prohibited transaction exemption issued by the Department of Labor under section 408(a) of ERISA;

(3) The actual cost of services provided to the plan by an unrelated third party; or

(4) Contributions where the contributions to a plan that receives special financial assistance required for each base unit are not reduced, except as otherwise permitted by paragraph (d) of this section.

(f) *Transfer or merger.* During the SFA coverage period, a plan must not engage in a transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff) or merger except with PBGC's approval.

(1) PBGC will approve a proposed transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff) or merger if PBGC determines that the transaction complies with section 4231(a)-(d) of ERISA and that the transaction, or the larger transaction of which the transfer or merger is a part, does not unreasonably increase PBGC's risk of loss with respect to any plan involved in the transaction, and is not reasonably expected to be adverse to the overall interests of the participants and beneficiaries of any of the plans involved in the transaction.

(2) A request for approval of a proposed transfer of assets or liabilities (including a spinoff) or merger must be submitted by the plan sponsor or its duly authorized representative and must contain the information that must be submitted with a notice of merger or transfer and a request for a compliance determination under subpart A of part 4231 of this chapter and all of the following actuarial and financial information for each of the plans involved in the transaction:

(iv) A detailed statement certified by an enrolled actuary that the transaction does not unreasonably increase PBGC's risk of loss with respect to any plan involved in the transaction. The statement must include the basis for the conclusion, supporting data, calculations, assumptions, a description of the methodology, the basis for assumptions used, the projected date of insolvency, and the present value of financial assistance expected to be paid to the plan by PBGC under section 4261 of ERISA as of the date of the transaction individually for each of the plans before and after the transaction. The present value of financial assistance must be based on the guaranteed benefits and administrative expenses presented in the cash flow projections under paragraph (f)(2)(v) of this section, discounted using interest rates published under section 4044 of ERISA.

(v) The statement in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section must include an exhibit showing the annual cash flow projections for each plan before and after the transaction, through the year that each plan pays its last dollar of benefit (but not to exceed 100 years). The cash flow projection should use an open group valuation until the plan reaches insolvency. Annual cash flow projections must reflect the following information:

(A) Fair market value of assets as of the beginning of the year, splitting the assets by special financial assistance and non-special financial assistance amounts.
