##### ยง 4050.5 Designated benefit. #####

(a) *Amount of designated benefit.* The amount of the designated benefit is the amount determined under paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) of this section (whichever is applicable) or, if less, the maximum amount that could be provided under the plan to the missing participant in the form of a single sum in accordance with section 415 of the Code.

(1) *Mandatory lump sum.* The designated benefit of a missing participant required under a plan to receive a mandatory lump sum as of the deemed distribution date is the lump sum payment that the plan administrator would have distributed to the missing participant as of the deemed distribution date.

(2) *De minimis lump sum.* The designated benefit of a missing participant not described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section whose benefit is not in pay status as of the deemed distribution date and whose benefit has a *de minimis* actuarial present value ($5,000 or less) as of the deemed distribution date under the missing participant lump sum assumptions is such value.

(3) *No lump sum.* The designated benefit of a missing participant not described in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section who, as of the deemed distribution date, cannot elect an immediate lump sum under the plan is the actuarial present value of the missing participant's benefit as of the deemed distribution date under the missing participant annuity assumptions.

(4) *Elective lump sum.* The designated benefit of a missing participant not described in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section is the greater of the amounts determined under the methodologies of paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section.

(b) *Assumptions.* When the plan administrator uses the missing participant annuity assumptions or the missing participant lump sum assumptions for purposes of determining the designated benefit under paragraph (a) of this section, the plan administrator must value the most valuable benefit, as determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, using the assumptions described in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section (whichever is applicable).

(1) *Most valuable benefit.* For a missing participant whose benefit is in pay status as of the deemed distribution date, the most valuable benefit is the pay status benefit. For a missing participant whose benefit is not in pay status as of the deemed distribution date, the most valuable benefit is the benefit payable at the age on or after the deemed distribution date (beginning with the participant's earliest early retirement age and ending with the participant's normal retirement age) for which the present value as of the deemed distribution date is the greatest. The present value as of the deemed distribution date with respect to any age is determined by multiplying:

(i) The monthly (or other periodic) benefit payable under the plan; by

(ii) The present value (determined as of the deemed distribution date using the missing participant annuity assumptions) of a $1 monthly (or other periodic) annuity beginning at the applicable age.

(2) *Participant.* A missing participant who is a participant, and whose benefit is not in pay status as of the deemed distribution date, is assumed to be married to a spouse the same age, and the form of benefit that must be valued is the qualified joint and survivor annuity benefit that would be payable under the plan. If the participant's benefit is in pay status as of the deemed distribution date, the form and beneficiary of the participant's benefit are the form of benefit and beneficiary of the pay status benefit.

(3) *Beneficiary.* A missing participant who is a beneficiary, and whose benefit is not in pay status as of the deemed distribution date, is assumed not to be married, and the form of benefit that must be valued is the survivor benefit that would be payable under the plan. If the beneficiary's benefit is in pay status as of the deemed distribution date, the form and beneficiary of the beneficiary's benefit are the form of benefit and beneficiary of the pay status benefit.

(4) *Examples.* See Appendix A to this part for examples illustrating the provisions of this section.

(c) *Missed payments.* In determining the designated benefit, the plan administrator must include the value of any payments that were due before the deemed distribution date but that were not made.

(d) *Payment of designated benefits.* Payment of designated benefits must be made in accordance with ยง 4050.6 and will be deemed made on the deemed distribution date.
