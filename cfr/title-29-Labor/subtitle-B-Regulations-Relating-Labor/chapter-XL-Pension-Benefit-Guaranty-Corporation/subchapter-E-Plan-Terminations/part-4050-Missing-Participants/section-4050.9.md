##### ยง 4050.9 Annuity or elective lump sum - living missing participant. #####

This section applies to a missing participant whose designated benefit was determined under ยง 4050.5(a)(3) (no lump sum) or ยง 4050.5(a)(4) (elective lump sum) and who is living on the date as of which the PBGC begins paying benefits.

(a) *Missing participant whose benefit was not in pay status as of the deemed distribution date.* The PBGC will pay the benefit of a missing participant whose benefit was not in pay status as of the deemed distribution date as follows.

(1) *Time and form of benefit.* The PBGC will pay the missing participant's benefit in the guaranteed benefit form, beginning on the annuity starting date elected by the missing participant (which may not be before the later of the date of the election or the earliest date on which the missing participant could have begun receiving benefits under the plan).

(2) *Amount of benefit.* The PBGC will pay a benefit that is actuarially equivalent to the unloaded designated benefit, *i.e.,* each monthly (or other periodic) benefit payment will equal the unloaded designated benefit divided by the present value (determined as of the deemed distribution date under the missing participant annuity assumptions) of a $1 monthly (or other periodic) annuity beginning on the annuity starting date.

(b) *Missing participant whose benefit was in pay status as of the deemed distribution date.* The PBGC will pay the benefit of a missing participant whose benefit was in pay status as of the deemed distribution date as follows.

(1) *Time and form of benefit.* The PBGC will pay the benefit in the form that was in pay status, beginning when the missing participant is located.

(2) *Amount of benefit.* The PBGC will pay the monthly (or other periodic) amount of the pay status benefit, plus a lump sum equal to the payments the missing participant would have received under the plan, plus interest on the missed payments (at the plan rate up to the deemed distribution date and thereafter at the designated benefit interest rate) to the date as of which the PBGC pays the lump sum.

(c) *Payment of lump sum.* If a missing participant whose designated benefit was determined under ยง 4050.5(a)(4) (elective lump sum) so elects, the PBGC will pay his or her benefit in the form of a single sum. This election is not effective unless the missing participant's spouse consents (if such consent would be required under section 205 of ERISA). The single sum equals the designated benefit plus interest (at the designated benefit interest rate) from the deemed distribution date to the date as of which the PBGC pays the benefit.
