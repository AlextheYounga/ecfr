##### ยง 4050.8 Automatic lump sum. #####

This section applies to a missing participant whose designated benefit was determined under ยง 4050.5(a)(1) (mandatory lump sum) or ยง 4050.5(a)(2) (*de minimis* lump sum).

(a) *General rule* - (1) *Benefit paid.* The PBGC will pay a single sum benefit equal to the designated benefit plus interest at the designated benefit interest rate from the deemed distribution date to the date on which the PBGC pays the benefit.

(2) *Payee.* Payment will be made -

(i) To the missing participant, if located;

(ii) If the missing participant died before the deemed distribution date, and if the plan so provides, to the missing participant's beneficiary or estate; or

(iii) If the missing participant dies on or after the deemed distribution date, to the missing participant's estate.

(b) *De minimis annuity alternative.* If the guaranteed benefit form for a missing participant whose designated benefit was determined under ยง 4050.5(a)(2) (*de minimis* lump sum) (or the guaranteed benefit form for a beneficiary of such a missing participant) would provide for the election of an annuity, the missing participant (or the beneficiary) may elect to receive an annuity. If such an election is made -

(1) The PBGC will pay the benefit in the elected guaranteed benefit form, beginning on the annuity starting date elected by the missing participant (or the beneficiary), which may not be before the later of the date of the election or the earliest date on which the missing participant (or the beneficiary) could have begun receiving benefits under the plan; and

(2) The benefit paid will be actuarially equivalent to the designated benefit, *i.e.,* each monthly (or other periodic) benefit payment will equal the designated benefit divided by the present value (determined as of the deemed distribution date under the missing participant lump sum assumptions) of a $1 monthly (or other periodic) annuity beginning on the annuity starting date.
