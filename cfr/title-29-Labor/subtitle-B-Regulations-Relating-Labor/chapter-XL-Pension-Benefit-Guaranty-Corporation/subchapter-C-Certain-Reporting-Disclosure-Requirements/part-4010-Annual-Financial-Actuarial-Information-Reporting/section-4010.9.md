(1) The audited consolidated financial statements for the filer's information year or, if the audited consolidated financial statements are not available by the date specified in ยง 4010.10(a), unaudited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending within the information year; and

(2) For each controlled group member included in the consolidated financial statements (other than an exempt entity), the member's revenues and operating income for the information year, and net assets at the end of the information year.

(c) *Subsequent submissions.* If unaudited financial statements are submitted as provided in paragraph (a)(2) or (b)(1) of this section, audited financial statements must thereafter be filed within 15 days after they are prepared, if they are prepared. If federal tax returns are submitted as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, audited and unaudited financial statements, if prepared must thereafter be filed within 15 days after they are prepared.
