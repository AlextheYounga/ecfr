If no EIN or PIN has been assigned, the notice shall so indicate.

(4) The IRS key district that has jurisdiction over determination letters with respect to the plan.

(8) A copy of the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan and a copy of the most recent Schedule B (Form 5500) filed for the plan, if the Schedule B contains more recent information than the actuarial valuation.

(5) A statement that, during the insolvency year, benefits above the amount that can be paid from available resources or the level guaranteed by the PBGC, whichever is greater, will be suspended, with a brief explanation of which benefits are guaranteed by the PBGC. The following statement may be included as an explanation of PBGC-guaranteed benefits:

Should the plan become insolvent, each participant's benefit guaranteed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is determined as follows. Each participant's nonforfeitable monthly benefit payable under the plan at retirement is computed. This benefit is then divided by the participant's years of credited service under the plan. Of the resulting figure (the accrual rate), the first $5 is guaranteed at 100%. Any additional amount (up to $15) is either 75% or 65% guaranteed, depending on the past funding practices of the plan. Any remaining amount that exceeds $20 is not guaranteed. The PBGC guarantees the payment of a monthly benefit equal to this adjusted accrual rate times years of credited service. The PBGC does not guarantee benefits or benefit increases that have been in effect for fewer than 60 months before the plan becomes insolvent or is amended to reduce accrued benefits.

(6) The name, address, and telephone number of the plan administrator or other person designated by the plan sponsor to answer inquiries concerning benefits during the plan's insolvency.
