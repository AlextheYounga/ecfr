##### ยง 4231.2 Definitions. #####

The following terms are defined in ยง 4001.2 of this chapter: Code, EIN, ERISA, fair market value, IRS, multiemployer plan, PBGC, plan, plan year, and PN.

In addition, for purposes of this part:

*Actuarial valuation* means a valuation of assets and liabilities performed by an enrolled actuary using the actuarial assumptions used for purposes of determining the charges and credits to the funding standard account under section 304 of ERISA and section 431 of the Code.

*Certified change of collective bargaining representative* means a change of collective bargaining representative certified under the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, or the Railway Labor Act, as amended.

*Fair market value of assets* has the same meaning as the term has for minimum funding purposes under section 304 of ERISA and section 431 of the Code.

*Merger* means the combining of two or more plans into a single plan. For example, a consolidation of two plans into a new plan is a merger.

*Significantly affected plan* means a plan that -

(1) Transfers assets that equal or exceed 15 percent of its assets before the transfer,

(2) Receives a transfer of unfunded accrued benefits that equal or exceed 15 percent of its assets before the transfer,

(3) Is created by a spinoff from another plan, or

(4) Engages in a merger or transfer (other than a *de minimis* merger or transfer) either -

(i) After such plan has terminated by mass withdrawal under section 4041A(a)(2) of ERISA, or

(ii) With another plan that has so terminated.

*Transfer* and *transfer of assets or liabilities* mean a diminution of assets or liabilities with respect to one plan and the acquisition of these assets or the assumption of these liabilities by another plan or plans (including a plan that did not exist prior to the transfer). However, the shifting of assets or liabilities pursuant to a written reciprocity agreement between two multiemployer plans in which one plan assumes liabilities of another plan is not a transfer of assets or liabilities. In addition, the shifting of assets between several funding media used for a single plan (such as between trusts, between annuity contracts, or between trusts and annuity contracts) is not a transfer of assets or liabilities.

*Unfunded accrued benefits* means the excess of the present value of a plan's accrued benefits over the fair market value of its assets, determined on the basis of the actuarial valuation required under ยง 4231.5(b).
