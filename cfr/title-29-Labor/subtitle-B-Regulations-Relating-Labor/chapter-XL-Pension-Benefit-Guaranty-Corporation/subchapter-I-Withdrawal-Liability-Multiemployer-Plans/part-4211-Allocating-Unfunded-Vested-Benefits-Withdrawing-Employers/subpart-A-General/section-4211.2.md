*Initial plan year* means a merged plan's first complete plan year that begins after the establishment of the merged plan.

*Initial plan year unfunded vested benefits* means the unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the initial plan year, less the value as of the end of the initial plan year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability that can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers that had withdrawn as of the end of the initial plan year.

*Merged plan* means a plan that is the result of the merger of two or more multiemployer plans.

*Nonforfeitable benefit* means a benefit described in ยง 4001.2 of this chapter plus, for purposes of this part, any adjustable benefit that has been reduced by the plan sponsor pursuant to section 305(e)(8) of ERISA or section 432(e)(8) of the Code that would otherwise have been includable as a nonforfeitable benefit for purposes of determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits.

*Prior plan* means the plan in which an employer participated immediately before that plan became a part of the merged plan.

*Unfunded vested benefits* means an amount by which the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan as defined for purposes of this section, exceeds the value of the assets of the plan.
