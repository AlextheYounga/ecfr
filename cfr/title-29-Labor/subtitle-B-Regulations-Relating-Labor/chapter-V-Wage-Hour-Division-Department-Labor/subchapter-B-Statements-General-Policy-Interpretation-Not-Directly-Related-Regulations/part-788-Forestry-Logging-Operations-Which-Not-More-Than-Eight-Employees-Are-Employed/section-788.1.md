##### ยง 788.1 Statutory provisions. #####

Section 13(a)(13) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, provides an exemption from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Act, as follows:

The provisions of sections 6 and 7 shall not apply with respect to \* \* \* any employee employed in planting or tending trees, cruising, surveying, or felling timber, or in preparing or transporting logs or other forestry products to the mill, processing plant, railroad, or other transportation terminal, if the number of employees employed by his employer in such forestry or lumbering operations does not exceed eight.

This exemption, formerly section 13(a)(15) of the Act, was amended by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966 (80 Stat. 830) to change the number of employees limitation from 12 to eight, and to redesignate it as section 13(a)(13).
