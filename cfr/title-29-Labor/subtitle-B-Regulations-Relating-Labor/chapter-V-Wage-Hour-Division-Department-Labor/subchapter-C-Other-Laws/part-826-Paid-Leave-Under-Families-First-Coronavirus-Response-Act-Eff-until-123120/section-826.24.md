##### § 826.24 Amount of pay for Expanded Family and Medical Leave. #####

Subject to § 826.60, after the initial two weeks of Expanded Family and Medical Leave, the Employer shall pay the Eligible Employee two-thirds of the Eligible Employee's average regular rate, as computed under § 826.25, times the Eligible Employee's scheduled number of hours for each day of such leave taken.

(a) In no event shall an Employer be required to pay more than $200 per day and $10,000 in the aggregate per Eligible Employee when an Eligible Employee takes Expanded Family and Medical Leave for up to ten weeks after the initial two-week period of unpaid Expanded Family and Medical Leave.

(b) For the purpose of this section, the “scheduled number of hours” is determined as follows:

(1) If the Eligible Employee has a normal work schedule, the number of hours the Eligible Employee is normally scheduled to work on that workday;

(2) If the Eligible Employee has a work schedule that varies to such an extent that an Employer is unable to determine the number of hours the Eligible Employee would have worked on the day for which leave is taken and has been employed for at least six months, the average number of hours the Eligible Employee was scheduled to work each workday, over the six-month period ending on the date on which the Eligible Employee first takes Expanded Family and Medical Leave, including hours for which the Eligible Employee took leave of any type; or

(3) If the Eligible Employee has a work schedule that varies to such an extent that an Employer is unable to determine the number of hours the Eligible Employee would have worked on the day for which leave is taken and the Eligible Employee has been employed for fewer than six months, the average number of hours the Eligible Employee and the Employer agreed at the time of hiring that the Eligible Employee would work each workday. If there is no such agreement, the scheduled number of hours is equal to the average number of hours per workday that the Eligible Employee was scheduled to work over the entire period of employment, including hours for which the Eligible Employee took leave of any type.

(c) As an alternative, the amount of pay for Expanded Family and Medical Leave may be computed in hourly increments instead a full day. For each hour of Expanded Family and Medical Leave taken after the first two weeks, the Employer shall pay the Eligible Employee two-thirds of the Eligible Employee's average regular rate, as computed under § 826.25.

(d) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if an Eligible Employee elects or is required to use leave available to the Eligible Employee for the purpose set forth in § 826.20(b) under the Employer's policies, such as vacation or personal leave or paid time off, concurrently with Expanded Family and Medical Leave, the Employer must pay the Eligible Employee a full day's pay for that day. However, the Employer is capped at taking $200 a day or $10,000 in the aggregate in tax credits for Expanded Family and Medical Leave paid under the EFMLEA.
