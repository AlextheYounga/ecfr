##### § 826.30 Employee eligibility for leave. #####

(a) *Eligibility under the EPSLA.* All Employees of an Employer are eligible for Paid Sick Leave under the EPSLA, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and in § 826.40(b).

(b) *Eligibility under the EFMLEA.* All Employees employed by an Employer for at least thirty calendar days are eligible for Expanded Family and Medical Leave under the EFMLEA, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) in this section and in § 826.40(b).

(1) An Employee is considered to have been employed by an Employer for at least thirty calendar days if:

(i) The Employer had the Employee on its payroll for the thirty calendar days immediately prior to the day that the Employee's leave would begin; or

(ii) The Employee was laid off or otherwise terminated by the Employer on or after March 1, 2020, and rehired or otherwise reemployed by the Employer on or before December 31, 2020, provided that the Employee had been on the Employer's payroll for thirty or more of the sixty calendar days prior to the date the Employee was laid off or otherwise terminated.

(2) If an Employee employed by a temporary placement agency is subsequently hired by the Employer, the Employer will count the days worked as a temporary Employee at the Employer toward the thirty-day eligibility period.

(3) An Employee who has been employed by a covered Employer for at least thirty calendar days is eligible for Expanded Family and Medical Leave under the EFMLEA regardless of whether the Employee would otherwise be eligible for leave under the FMLA. Thus, for example, an Employee need not have been employed for 1,250 hours of service and twelve months of employment as otherwise required under the FMLA, see § 825.110(a)(1) and (2) of this chapter, to be eligible for leave under the EFMLEA.

(c) *Exclusion of Employees who are health care providers and emergency responders.* An Employer whose Employee is a health care provider or an emergency responder may exclude such Employee from the EPSLA's Paid Sick Leave requirements and/or the EFMLEA's Expanded Family and Medical Leave requirements.
