##### § 826.30 Employee eligibility for leave. #####

(a) *Eligibility under the EPSLA.* All Employees of an Employer are eligible for Paid Sick Leave under the EPSLA, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and in § 826.40(b).

(b) *Eligibility under the EFMLEA.* All Employees employed by an Employer for at least thirty calendar days are eligible for Expanded Family and Medical Leave under the EFMLEA, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) in this section and in § 826.40(b).

(1) An Employee is considered to have been employed by an Employer for at least thirty calendar days if:

(i) The Employer had the Employee on its payroll for the thirty calendar days immediately prior to the day that the Employee's leave would begin; or

(ii) The Employee was laid off or otherwise terminated by the Employer on or after March 1, 2020, and rehired or otherwise reemployed by the Employer on or before December 31, 2020, provided that the Employee had been on the Employer's payroll for thirty or more of the sixty calendar days prior to the date the Employee was laid off or otherwise terminated.

(2) If an Employee employed by a temporary placement agency is subsequently hired by the Employer, the Employer will count the days worked as a temporary Employee at the Employer toward the thirty-day eligibility period.

(3) An Employee who has been employed by a covered Employer for at least thirty calendar days is eligible for Expanded Family and Medical Leave under the EFMLEA regardless of whether the Employee would otherwise be eligible for leave under the FMLA. Thus, for example, an Employee need not have been employed for 1,250 hours of service and twelve months of employment as otherwise required under the FMLA, see § 825.110(a)(1) and (2) of this chapter, to be eligible for leave under the EFMLEA.

(c) *Exclusion of Employees who are health care providers and emergency responders.* An Employer whose Employee is a health care provider or an emergency responder may exclude such Employee from the EPSLA's Paid Sick Leave requirements and/or the EFMLEA's Expanded Family and Medical Leave requirements.

(1) *Health care provider* - (i) *Basic definition.* For the purposes of Employees who may be exempted from Paid Sick Leave or Expanded Family and Medical Leave by their Employer under the FFCRA, a health care provider is

(A) Any Employee who is a health care provider under 29 CFR 825.102 and 825.125, or;

(B) Any other Employee who is capable of providing health care services, meaning he or she is employed to provide diagnostic services, preventive services, treatment services, or other services that are integrated with and necessary to the provision of patient care and, if not provided, would adversely impact patient care.

(ii) *Types of Employees.* Employees described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) include only:

(A) Nurses, nurse assistants, medical technicians, and any other persons who directly provide services described in (c)(1)(i)(B);

(B) Employees providing services described in (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section under the supervision, order, or direction of, or providing direct assistance to, a person described in paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A) or (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section; and

(C) Employees who are otherwise integrated into and necessary to the provision of health care services, such as laboratory technicians who process test results necessary to diagnoses and treatment.

(iii) Employees who do not provide health care services as described above are not health care providers even if their services could affect the provision of health care services, such as IT professionals, building maintenance staff, human resources personnel, cooks, food services workers, records managers, consultants, and billers.

(iv) *Typical work locations.* Employees described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section may include Employees who work at, for example, a doctor's office, hospital, health care center, clinic, medical school, local health department or agency, nursing facility, retirement facility, nursing home, home health care provider, any facility that performs laboratory or medical testing, pharmacy, or any similar permanent or temporary institution, facility, location, or site where medical services are provided. This list is illustrative. An Employee does not need to work at one of these facilities to be a health care provider, and working at one of these facilities does not necessarily mean an Employee is a health care provider.

(v) *Further clarifications.* (A) Diagnostic services include taking or processing samples, performing or assisting in the performance of x-rays or other diagnostic tests or procedures, and interpreting test or procedure results.

(B) Preventive services include screenings, check-ups, and counseling to prevent illnesses, disease, or other health problems.

(C) Treatment services include performing surgery or other invasive or physical interventions, prescribing medication, providing or administering prescribed medication, physical therapy, and providing or assisting in breathing treatments.

(D) Services that are integrated with and necessary to diagnostic, preventive, or treatment services and, if not provided, would adversely impact patient care, include bathing, dressing, hand feeding, taking vital signs, setting up medical equipment for procedures, and transporting patients and samples.

(vi) The definition of *health care provider* contained in this section applies only for the purpose of determining whether an Employer may elect to exclude an Employee from taking leave under the EPSLA and/or the EFMLEA, and does not otherwise apply for purposes of the FMLA or section 5102(a)(2) of the EPSLA.

(2) Emergency responders -

(i) For the purposes of Employees who may be excluded from Paid Sick Leave or Expanded Family and Medical Leave by their Employer under the FFCRA, an emergency responder is anyone necessary for the provision of transport, care, healthcare, comfort and nutrition of such patients, or others needed for the response to COVID-19. This includes but is not limited to military or national guard, law enforcement officers, correctional institution personnel, fire fighters, emergency medical services personnel, physicians, nurses, public health personnel, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, emergency management personnel, 911 operators, child welfare workers and service providers, public works personnel, and persons with skills or training in operating specialized equipment or other skills needed to provide aid in a declared emergency, as well as individuals who work for such facilities employing these individuals and whose work is necessary to maintain the operation of the facility. This also includes any individual whom the highest official of a State or territory, including the District of Columbia, determines is an emergency responder necessary for that State's or territory's or the District of Columbia's response to COVID-19.
