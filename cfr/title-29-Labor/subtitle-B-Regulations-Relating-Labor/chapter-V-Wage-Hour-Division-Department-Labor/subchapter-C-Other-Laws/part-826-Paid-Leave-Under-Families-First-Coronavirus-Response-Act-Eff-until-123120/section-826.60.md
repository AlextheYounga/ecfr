##### ยง 826.60 Leave to care for a child due to school or place of care closure or child care unavailability - Intersection between the EPSLA and the EFMLEA. #####

(a) An Eligible Employee who needs leave to care for his or her Son or Daughter whose School or Place of Care is closed, or whose Child Care Provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 related reasons may be eligible to take leave under both the EPSLA and the EFMLEA. If so, the benefits provided by the EPSLA run concurrently with those provided under the EFMLEA.

(1) *Intersection between the EPSLA and the EFMLEA.* An Eligible Employee may take up to twelve weeks of Expanded Family and Medical Leave to care for his or her Son or Daughter whose School or Place of Care has been closed, or whose Child Care Provider is unavailable, due to COVID-19 related reasons.

(2) The first two weeks of leave (up to 80 hours) may be paid under the EPSLA; the subsequent weeks are paid under the EFMLEA.

(3) An Employee's prior use of Paid Sick Leave under EPSLA will impact the amount of Paid Sick Leave that remains available to the Employee.

(4) An Eligible Employee who has exhausted his or her twelve workweek FMLA entitlement, *see* ยง 826.70, is not precluded from taking Paid Sick Leave.

(b) *Supplementing Expanded Family and Medical Leave with other accrued Employer-provided leave.*

(1) Where an Eligible Employee takes Expanded Family and Medical Leave after taking all or part of his or her Paid Sick Leave for a reason other than that provided in ยง 826.20(a)(1)(v), all or part of the Eligible Employee's first ten days (or first two weeks) of Expanded Family and Medical Leave may be unpaid because the Eligible Employee will have exhausted his or her Paid Sick Leave entitlement.

(2) Under the circumstances in (b)(1) of this section, the Eligible Employee may choose to substitute earned or accrued paid leave provided by the Employer during this period. The term substitute means that the preexisting paid leave provided by the Employer, which has been earned or accrued pursuant to established policies of the Employer, will run concurrently with the unpaid Expanded Family and Medical Leave. Accordingly, the Eligible Employee receives pay pursuant to the Employer's preexisting paid leave policy during the period of otherwise unpaid Expanded Family and Medical Leave.

(3) If the Eligible Employee does not elect to substitute paid leave for unpaid Expanded Family and Medical Leave under the above conditions and circumstances, the Eligible Employee will remain entitled to any paid leave that the Eligible Employee has earned or accrued under the terms of his or her Employer's plan.
