##### § 826.25 Calculating the regular rate under the Family First Coronavirus Response Act. #####

(a) *Average regular rate.* The “average regular rate” used to compute pay for Paid Sick Leave and Expanded Family and Medical Leave is calculated as follows:

(1) Use the methods contained in parts 531 and 778 of this chapter to compute the regular rate for each full workweek in which the Employee has been employed over the lesser of:

(i) The six-month period ending on the date on which the Employee takes Paid Sick Leave or Expanded Family and Medical Leave; or

(ii) The entire period of employment.

(2) Compute the average of the weekly regular rates under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, weighted by the number of hours worked for each workweek.

(b) *Calculating the regular rate for commissions, tips, and piece rates.* An Employee's commissions, tips, and piece rates are incorporated into the regular rate for purposes of the FFCRA to the same extent that they are included in the calculation of the regular rate under the FLSA, and § 531.60 and part 778 of this chapter.
