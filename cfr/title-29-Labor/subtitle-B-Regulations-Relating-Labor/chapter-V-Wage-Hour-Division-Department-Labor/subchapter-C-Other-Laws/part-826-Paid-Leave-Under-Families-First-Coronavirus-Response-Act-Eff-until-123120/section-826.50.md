##### ยง 826.50 Intermittent leave. #####

(d) *Calculation of leave.* If an Employee takes Paid Sick Leave or Expanded Family and Medical Leave intermittently as the Employee and Employer have agreed, only the amount of leave actually taken may be counted toward the Employee's leave entitlements. For example, an Employee who normally works forty hours in a workweek and only takes three hours of leave each work day (for a weekly total of fifteen hours) has only taken fifteen hours of the Employee's Paid Sick Leave or 37.5% of a workweek of the Employee's Expanded Family and Medical Leave entitlement.
