##### ยง 501.30 Applicability of procedures and rules. #####

The procedures and rules contained herein prescribe the administrative process that will be applied with respect to a determination to assess civil money penalties, to debar, or to increase the amount of a surety bond and which may be applied to the enforcement of provisions of the work contract, or obligations under 8 U.S.C. 1188, 20 CFR part 655, subpart B, or the regulations in this part, or to the collection of monetary relief due as a result of any violation.
