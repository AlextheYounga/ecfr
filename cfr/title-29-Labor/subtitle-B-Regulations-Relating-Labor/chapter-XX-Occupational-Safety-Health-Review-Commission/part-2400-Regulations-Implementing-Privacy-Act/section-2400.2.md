##### ยง 2400.2 Description of agency. #####

The Commission adjudicates contested enforcement actions under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651-677). Decisions of the Commission on such actions are issued only after the parties to the case are afforded an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, United States Code. All such hearings are conducted by an OSHRC Administrative Law Judge at a place convenient to the parties and are open to the public. Each Commission member has the authority to direct that a decision of a Judge be reviewed by the full Commission before becoming a final order. The President designates one of the Commissioners as Chairman, who is responsible on behalf of the Commission for the administrative operations of the Commission.
