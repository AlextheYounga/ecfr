##### ยง 2400.7 Special procedures for requesting medical records. #####

(a) Upon an individual's request for access to his medical records, including psychological records, the Privacy Officer shall make a preliminary determination on whether access to such records could have an adverse effect upon the requester. If the Privacy Officer determines that access could have an adverse effect on the requester, OSHRC shall notify the requester in writing and advise that the records at issue can be made available only to a physician of the requester's designation. Upon receipt of such designation, verification of the identity of the physician, and agreement by the physician to review the documents with the requesting individual, to explain the meaning of the documents, and to offer counseling designed to temper any adverse reaction, OSHRC shall forward such records to the designated physician.

(b) If, within sixty (60) days of OSHRC's written request for a designation, the requester has failed to respond or designate a physician, or the physician fails to agree to the release conditions, then OSHRC shall hold the documents in abeyance and advise the requester that this action may be construed as a technical denial. OSHRC shall also advise the requester of his rights to administrative appeal and thereafter judicial review in a district court of the United States.
