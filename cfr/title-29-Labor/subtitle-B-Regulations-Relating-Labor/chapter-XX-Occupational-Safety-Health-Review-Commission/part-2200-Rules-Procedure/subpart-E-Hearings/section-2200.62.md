##### ยง 2200.62 Postponement of hearing. #####

(a) *Motion to postpone.* A hearing may be postponed by the Judge on his own initiative or for good cause shown upon the motion of a party. A motion for postponement shall state the position of the other parties, either by a joint motion or by a representation of the moving party. The filing of a motion for postponement does not automatically postpone a hearing.

(b) *Grounds for postponement.* A motion for postponement grounded on conflicting engagements of counsel or employment of new counsel shall be filed promptly after notice is given of the hearing, or as soon as the conflict is learned of or the engagement occurs.

(c) *When motion must be received.* A motion to postpone a hearing must be received at least 7 days prior to the hearing. A motion for postponement received less than 7 days prior to the hearing will generally be denied unless good cause is shown for late filing.

(d) *Postponement in excess of 60 days.* No postponement in excess of 60 days shall be granted without the concurrence of the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The original of any motion seeking a postponement in excess of 60 days shall be filed with the Judge and a copy sent to the Chief Administrative Law Judge.
