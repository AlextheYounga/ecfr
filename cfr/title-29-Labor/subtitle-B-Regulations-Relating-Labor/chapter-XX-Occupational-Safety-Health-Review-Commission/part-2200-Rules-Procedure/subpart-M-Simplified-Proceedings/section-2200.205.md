##### ยง 2200.205 Filing of pleadings. #####

(a) *Complaint and answer.* Once a case is designated for Simplified Proceedings, the complaint and answer requirements are suspended. If the Secretary has filed a complaint under ยง 2200.34(a), a response to a petition under ยง 2200.37(d)(5), or a response to an employee contest under ยง 2200.38(a), and if Simplified Proceedings have been ordered, no response to these documents will be required.

(b) *Motions.* A primary purpose of Simplified Proceedings is to eliminate, as much as possible, motions and similar documents. A motion will not be viewed favorably if the subject of the motion has not been first discussed among the parties.
