##### ยง 2200.22 Representation of parties and intervenors. #####

(a) *Representation.* Any party or intervenor may appear in person, through an attorney, or through another representative who is not an attorney. A representative must file an appearance in accordance with ยง 2200.23. In the absence of an appearance by a representative, a party or intervenor will be deemed to appear for himself. A corporation or unincorporated association may be represented by an authorized officer or agent.

(b) *Affected employees in collective bargaining unit.* Where an authorized employee representative (see ยง 2200.1(g)) elects to participate as a party, affected employees who are members of the collective bargaining unit may not separately elect party status. If the authorized employee representative does not elect party status, affected employees who are members of the collective bargaining unit may elect party status in the same manner as affected employees who are not members of the collective bargaining unit. See paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) *Affected employees not in collective bargaining unit.* Affected employees who are not members of a collective bargaining unit may elect party status under ยง 2200.20(a). If more than one employee so elects, the Judge shall provide for them to be treated as one party.

(d) *Control of proceeding.* A representative of a party or intervenor shall be deemed to control all matters respecting the interest of such party or intervenor in the proceeding.
