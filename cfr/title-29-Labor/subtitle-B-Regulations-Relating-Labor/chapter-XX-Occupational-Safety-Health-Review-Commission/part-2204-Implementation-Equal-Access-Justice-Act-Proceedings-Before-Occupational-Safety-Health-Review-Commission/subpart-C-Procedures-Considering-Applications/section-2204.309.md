##### § 2204.309 Commission review. #####

Commission review shall be in accordance with §§ 2200.91 and 2200.92. The applicant, the Secretary, or both may seek review of the judge's decision on the fee application, and the Commission may grant such petitions for review or direct review of the decision on the Commission's own initiative. The Commission delegates to each of its members the authority to order review of a judge's decision concerning a fee application. Whether to review a decision is a matter within the discretion of each member of the Commission. If the Commission does not direct review, the judge's decision on the application shall become a final decision of the Commission 30 days after it is received and docketed by the Executive Secretary of the Commission. If review is directed, the Commission shall issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the judge for further proceedings.
