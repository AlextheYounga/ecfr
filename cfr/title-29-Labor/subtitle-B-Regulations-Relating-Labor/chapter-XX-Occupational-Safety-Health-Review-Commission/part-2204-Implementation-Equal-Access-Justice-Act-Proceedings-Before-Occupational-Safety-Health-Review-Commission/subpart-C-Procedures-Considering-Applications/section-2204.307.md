##### ยง 2204.307 Further proceedings. #####

(a)(1) The determination of an award shall be made on the basis of the record made during the proceeding for which fees and expenses are sought, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section.

(2) On the motion of a party or on the judge's own initiative, the judge may order further proceedings, including discovery and an evidentiary hearing, as to issues other than substantial justification (such as the applicant's eligibility or substantiation of fees and expenses).

(3) If the proceeding for which fees and expenses are sought ended before the Secretary had an opportunity to introduce evidence supporting the citation or notification of proposed penalty (for example, a citation was withdrawn or settled before an evidentiary hearing was held), the Secretary may supplement the record with affidavits or other documentary evidence of substantial justification.

(b) A request that the judge order further proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.
