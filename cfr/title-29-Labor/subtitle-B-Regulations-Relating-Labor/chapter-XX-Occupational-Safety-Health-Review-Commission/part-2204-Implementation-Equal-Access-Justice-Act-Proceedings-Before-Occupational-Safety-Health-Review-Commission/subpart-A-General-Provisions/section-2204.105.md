(b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows:

(1) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interest, and employs not more than 500 employees;

(2) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;

(5) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million.

(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the notice of contest was filed, or, in the case of a petition for modification of abatement period, the date the petition was received by the Commission under § 2200.37(d).

(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business shall be considered as an “individual” rather than a “sole owner of an unincorporated business” only if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than business interests.

(e) For the purpose of determining eligibility under the EAJA, the employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.
