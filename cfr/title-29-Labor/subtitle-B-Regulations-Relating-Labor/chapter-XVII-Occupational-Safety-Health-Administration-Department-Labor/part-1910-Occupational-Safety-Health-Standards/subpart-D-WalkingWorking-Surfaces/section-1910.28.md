##### § 1910.28 Safety requirements for scaffolding. #####

(a) *General requirements for all scaffolds.* (1) Scaffolds shall be furnished and erected in accordance with this standard for persons engaged in work that cannot be done safely from the ground or from solid construction, except that ladders used for such work shall conform to §§ 1910.25 and 1910.26.

(2) The footing or anchorage for scaffolds shall be sound, rigid, and capable of carrying the maximum intended load without settling or displacement. Unstable objects such as barrels, boxes, loose brick, or concrete blocks shall not be used to support scaffolds or planks.

(3) [Reserved]

(4) Scaffolds and their components shall be capable of supporting without failure at least four times the maximum intended load.

(5) Scaffolds and other devices mentioned or described in this section shall be maintained in safe condition. Scaffolds shall not be altered or moved horizontally while they are in use or occupied.

(6) Any scaffold damaged or weakened from any cause shall be immediately repaired and shall not be used until repairs have been completed.

(7) Scaffolds shall not be loaded in excess of the working load for which they are intended.

(8) All load-carrying timber members of scaffold framing shall be a minimum of 1,500 *f.* (Stress Grade) construction grade lumber. All dimensions are nominal sizes as provided in the American Lumber Standards, except that where rough sizes are noted, only rough or undressed lumber of the size specified will satisfy minimum requirements. (Note: Where nominal sizes of lumber are used in place of rough sizes, the nominal size lumber shall be such as to provide equivalent strength to that specified in tables D-7 through D-12 and D-16.)

(9) All planking shall be Scaffold Grade as recognized by grading rules for the species of wood used. The maximum permissible spans for 2- × 9-inch or wider planks are shown in the following table:

|                               |        Material        |   |   |   |   |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|---|---|---|---|
|Full thickness undressed lumber|Nominal thickness lumber|   |   |   |   |
|                               |                        |   |   |   |   |
|     Working load (p.s.f.)     |           25           |50 |75 |25 |50 |
|    Permissible span (ft.)     |           10           | 8 | 6 | 8 | 9 |

The maximum permissible span for 11/4 × 9-inch or wider plank of full thickness is 4 feet with medium loading of 50 p.s.f.

(10) Nails or bolts used in the construction of scaffolds shall be of adequate size and in sufficient numbers at each connection to develop the designed strength of the scaffold. Nails shall not be subjected to a straight pull and shall be driven full length.

(11) All planking or platforms shall be overlapped (minimum 12 inches) or secured from movement.

(12) An access ladder or equivalent safe access shall be provided.

(13) Scaffold planks shall extend over their end supports not less than 6 inches nor more than 18 inches.

(14) The poles, legs, or uprights of scaffolds shall be plumb, and securely and rigidly braced to prevent swaying and displacement.

(15) Materials being hoisted onto a scaffold shall have a tag line.

(16) Overhead protection shall be provided for men on a scaffold exposed to overhead hazards.

(17) Scaffolds shall be provided with a screen between the toeboard and the guardrail, extending along the entire opening, consisting of No. 18 gauge U.S. Standard Wire one-half-inch mesh or the equivalent, where persons are required to work or pass under the scaffolds.

(18) Employees shall not work on scaffolds during storms or high winds.

(19) Employees shall not work on scaffolds which are covered with ice or snow, unless all ice or snow is removed and planking sanded to prevent slipping.

(20) Tools, materials, and debris shall not be allowed to accumulate in quantities to cause a hazard.

(21) Only treated or protected fiber rope shall be used for or near any work involving the use of corrosive substances or chemicals.

(22) Wire or fiber rope used for scaffold suspension shall be capable of supporting at least six times the intended load.

(23) When acid solutions are used for cleaning buildings over 50 feet in height, wire rope supported scaffolds shall be used.

(24) The use of shore scaffolds or lean-to scaffolds is prohibited.

(25) Lumber sizes, when used in this section, refer to nominal sizes except where otherwise stated.

(26) Scaffolds shall be secured to permanent structures, through use of anchor bolts, reveal bolts, or other equivalent means. Window cleaners' anchor bolts shall not be used.

(27) Special precautions shall be taken to protect scaffold members, including any wire or fiber ropes, when using a heat-producing process.

(b) *General requirements for wood pole scaffolds.* (1) Scaffold poles shall bear on a foundation of sufficient size and strength to spread the load from the poles over a sufficient area to prevent settlement. All poles shall be set plumb.

(2) Where wood poles are spliced, the ends shall be squared and the upper section shall rest squarely on the lower section. Wood splice plates shall be provided on at least two adjacent sides and shall not be less than 4 feet 0 inches in length, overlapping the abutted ends equally, and have the same width and not less than the cross-sectional area of the pole. Splice plates of other materials of equivalent strength may be used.

(3) Independent pole scaffolds shall be set as near to the wall of the building as practicable.

(4) All pole scaffolds shall be securely guyed or tied to the building or structure. Where the height or length exceeds 25 feet, the scaffold shall be secured at intervals not greater than 25 feet vertically and horizontally.

(5) Putlogs or bearers shall be set with their greater dimensions vertical, long enough to project over the ledgers of the inner and outer rows of poles at least 3 inches for proper support.

(6) Every wooden putlog on single pole scaffolds shall be reinforced with a3/16 × 2-inch steel strip or equivalent secured to its lower edge throughout its entire length.

(7) Ledgers shall be long enough to extend over two pole spaces. Ledgers shall not be spliced between the poles. Ledgers shall be reinforced by bearing blocks securely nailed to the side of the pole to form a support for the ledger.

(8) Diagonal bracing shall be provided to prevent the poles from moving in a direction parallel with the wall of the building, or from buckling.

(9) Cross bracing shall be provided between the inner and outer sets of poles in independent pole scaffolds. The free ends of pole scaffolds shall be cross braced.

(10) Full diagonal face bracing shall be erected across the entire face of pole scaffolds in both directions. The braces shall be spliced at the poles.

(11) Platform planks shall be laid with their edges close together so the platform will be tight with no spaces through which tools or fragments of material can fall.

(12) Where planking is lapped, each plank shall lap its end supports at least 12 inches. Where the ends of planks abut each other to form a flush floor, the butt joint shall be at the centerline of a pole. The abutted ends shall rest on separate bearers. Intermediate beams shall be provided where necessary to prevent dislodgment of planks due to deflection, and the ends shall be nailed or cleated to prevent their dislodgment.

(13) When a scaffold turns a corner, the platform planks shall be laid to prevent tipping. The planks that meet the corner putlog at an angle shall be laid first, extending over the diagonally placed putlog far enough to have a good safe bearing, but not far enough to involve any danger from tipping. The planking running in the opposite direction at right angles shall be laid so as to extend over and rest on the first layer of planking.

(14) When moving platforms to the next level, the old platform shall be left undisturbed until the new putlogs or bearers have been set in place, ready to receive the platform planks.

(15) Guardrails not less than 2 × 4 inches or the equivalent and not less than 36 inches or more than 42 inches high, with a mid-rail, when required, of 1 × 4-inch lumber or equivalent, and toeboards, shall be installed at all open sides on all scaffolds more than 10 feet above the ground or floor. Toeboards shall be a minimum of 4 inches in height. Wire mesh shall be installed in accordance with paragraph (a)(17) of this section.

(16) All wood pole scaffolds 60 feet or less in height shall be constructed and erected in accordance with tables D-7 through D-12 of this section. If they are over 60 feet in height they shall be designed by a registered professional engineer and constructed and erected in accordance with such design. A copy of the typical drawings and specifications shall be made available to the employer and for inspection purposes.

(17) Wood-pole scaffolds shall not be erected beyond the reach of effective firefighting apparatus.
