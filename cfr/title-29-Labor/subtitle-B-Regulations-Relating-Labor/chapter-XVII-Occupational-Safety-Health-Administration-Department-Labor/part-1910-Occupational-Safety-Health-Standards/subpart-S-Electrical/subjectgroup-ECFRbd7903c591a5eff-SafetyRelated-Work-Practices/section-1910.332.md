##### § 1910.332 Training. #####

(a) *Scope.* The training requirements contained in this section apply to employees who face a risk of electric shock that is not reduced to a safe level by the electrical installation requirements of §§ 1910.303 through 1910.308.

Note:

Employees in occupations listed in Table S-4 face such a risk and are required to be trained. Other employees who also may reasonably be expected to face a comparable risk of injury due to electric shock or other electrical hazards must also be trained.

(b) *Content of training*—(1) *Practices addressed in this standard.* Employees shall be trained in and familiar with the safety-related work practices required by §§ 1910.331 through 1910.335 that pertain to their respective job assignments.

(2) *Additional requirements for unqualified persons.* Employees who are covered by paragraph (a) of this section but who are not qualified persons shall also be trained in and familiar with any electrically related safety practices not specifically addressed by §§ 1910.331 through 1910.335 but which are necessary for their safety.

(3) *Additional requirements for qualified persons.* Qualified persons (i.e., those permitted to work on or near exposed energized parts) shall, at a minimum, be trained in and familiar with the following:

(i) The skills and techniques necessary to distinguish exposed live parts from other parts of electric equipment,

(ii) The skills and techniques necessary to determine the nominal voltage of exposed live parts, and

(iii) The clearance distances specified in § 1910.333(c) and the corresponding voltages to which the qualified person will be exposed.

Note 1:

For the purposes of §§ 1910.331 through 1910.335, a person must have the training required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section in order to be considered a qualified person.

Note 2:

Qualified persons whose work on energized equipment involves either direct contact or contact by means of tools or materials must also have the training needed to meet § 1910.333(c)(2).

(c) *Type of training.* The training required by this section shall be of the classroom or on-the-job type. The degree of training provided shall be determined by the risk to the employee.
