Appendix A to § 1910.1043 - Air Sampling and Analytical Procedures for Determining Concentrations of Cotton Dusti. sampling locations

The sampling procedures must be designed so that samples of the actual dust concentrations are collected accurately and consistently and reflect the concentrations of dust at the place and time of sampling. Sufficient number of 6-hour area samples in each distinct work area of the plant should be collected at locations which provide representative samples of air to which the worker is exposed. In order to avoid filter overloading, sampling time may be shortened when sampling in dusty areas. Samples in each work area should be gathered simultaneously or sequentially during a normal operating period. The daily time-weighted average (TWA) exposure of each worker can then be determined by using the following formula:

Summation of hours spent in each location and the dust concentration in that location.Total hours exposedA time-weighted average concentration should be computed for each worker and properly logged and maintained on file for review.ii. sampling equipment

(a) Sampler. The instrument selected for monitoring is the Lumsden-Lynch vertical elutriator. It should operate at a flow rate of 7.4±0.2 liters/minute.

The samplers should be cleaned prior to sampling. The pumps should be monitored during sampling.

(b) Filter Holder. A three-piece cassette constructed of polystyrene designed to hold a 37-mm diameter filter should be used. Care must be exercised to insure that an adequate seal exists between elements of the cassette.

(c) Filers and Support Pads. The membrane filters used should be polyvinyl chloride with a 5-um pore size and 37-mm diameter. A support pad, commonly called a backup pad, should be used under the filter membrane in the field monitor cassette.

(d) Balance. A balance sensitive to 10 micrograms should be used.

(e) Monitoring equipment for use in Class III hazardous locations must be approved for use in such locations, in accordance with the requirements of the OSHA electrical standards in subpart S of part 1910.

iii. instrument calibration procedure

Samplers shall be calibrated when first received from the factory, after repair, and after receiving any abuse. The samplers should be calibrated in the laboratory both before they are used in the field and after they have been used to collect a large number of field samples. The primary standard, such as a spirometer or other standard calibrating instruments such as a wet test meter or a large bubble meter or dry gas meter, should be used. Instructions for calibration with the wet test meter follow. If another calibration device is selected, equivalent procedures should be used:

(a) Level wet test meter. Check the water level which should just touch the calibration point at the left side of the meter. If water level is low, add water 1-2 °F. warmer than room temperature of till point. Run the meter for 30 minutes before calibration;

(b) Place the polyvinyl chloride membrane filter in the filter cassette;

(c) Assemble the calibration sampling train;

(d) Connect the wet test meter to the train.

The pointer on the meter should run clockwise and a pressure drop of not more than 1.0 inch of water indicated. If the pressure drop is greater than 1.0, disconnect and check the system;

(e) Operate the system for ten minutes before starting the calibration;

(f) Check the vacuum gauge on the pump to insure that the pressure drop across the orifice exceeds 17 inches of mercury;

(8) Record starting time, cassette number, and sampler number;

(9) At end of sampling period stop pump and record time; and

(10) Controls with each batch of samples collected, two additional filter cassettes should be subjected to exactly the same handling as the samples, except that they are not opened. These control filters should be weighed in the same manner as the sample filters.

Any difference in weight in the control filters would indicate that the procedure for handling sample filters may not be adequate and should be evaluated to ascertain the cause of the difference, whether and what necessary corrections must be made, and whether additional samples must be collected.

(d) Shipping. The cassette with samples should be collected, along with the appropriate number of blanks, and shipped to the analytical laboratory in a suitable container to prevent damage in transit.

(e) Weighing of the sample should be achieved as follows:

(1) Remove shrink band;

(2) Remove top and middle sections of cassette and botton plug;

(3) Remove filter from cassette and weigh to an accuracy of 10 µg; and

(4) Record weight in log against original weight

(f) Calculation of volume of air sampled should be determined as follows:

(1) From starting and stopping times of sampling period, determine length of time in minutes of sampling period; and

(2) Multiply sampling time in minutes by flow rate of critical orifice in liters per minute and divide by 1000 to find air quantity in cubic meters.

(g) Calculation of Dust Concentrations should be made as follows:

(1) Substract weight of clean filter from dirty filter and apply control correction to find actual weight of sample. Record this weight (in µg) in log; and

(2) Divide mass of sample in µg by air volume in cubic meters to find dust concentration in µg/m. Record in log.

The spirometric measurements of pulmonary function shall conform to the following minimum standards, and these standards are not intended to preclude additional testing or alternate methods which can be determined to be superior.

i. apparatus

a. The instrument shall be accurate to within ±50 milliliters or within ±3 percent of reading, whichever is greater.

b. The instrument should be capable of measuring vital capacity from 0 to 7 liters BTPS.

c. The instrument shall have a low inertia and offer low resistance to airflow such that the resistance to airflow at 12 liters per second must be less than 1.5 cm H2 O/(liter/sec).

d. The zero time point for the purpose of timing the FEV1 shall be determined by extrapolating the steepest portion of the volume time curve back to the maximal inspiration volume (1, 2, 3, 4) or by an equivalent method.

e. Instruments incorporating measurements of airflow to determine volume shall conform to the same volume accuracy stated in (a) of this section when presented with flow rates from at least 0 to 12 liters per second.

f. The instrument or user of the instrument must have a means of correcting volumes to body temperature saturated with water vapor (BTPS) under conditions of varying ambient spirometer temperatures and barometric pressures.

g. The instrument used shall provide a tracing or display of either flow versus volume or volume versus time during the entire forced expiration. A tracing or display is necessary to determine whether the patient has performed the test properly. The tracing must be stored and available for recall and must be of sufficient size that hand measurements may be made within requirement of paragraph (a) of this section. If a paper record is made it must have a paper speed of at least 2 cm/sec and a volume sensitivity of at least 10.0 mm of chart per liter of volume.

h. The instrument shall be capable of accumulating volume for a minimum of 10 seconds and shall not stop accumulating volume before (1) the volume change for a 0.5 second interval is less than 25 milliliters, or (2) the flow is less than 50 milliliters per second for a 0.5 second interval.

i. The forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) measurements shall comply with the accuracy requirements stated in paragraph (a) of this section. That is, they should be accurately measured to within ±50 ml or within ±3 percent of reading, whichever is greater.

j. The instrument must be capable of being calibrated in the field with respect to the FEV1 and FVC. This calibration of the FEV1 and FVC may be either directly or indirectly through volume and time base measurements. The volume calibration source should provide a volume displacement of at least 2 liters and should be accurate to within ±30 milliliters.

ii. technique for measurement of forced vital capacity maneuver

a. Use of a nose clip is recommended but not required. The procedures shall be explained in simple terms to the patient who shall be instructed to loosen any tight clothing and stand in front of the apparatus. The subject may sit, but care should be taken on repeat testing that the same position be used and, if possible, the same spirometer. Particular attention shall be given to insure that the chin is slightly elevated with the neck slightly extended. The patient shall be instructed to make a full inspiration from a normal breathing pattern and then blow into the apparatus, without interruption, as hard, fast, and completely as possible. At least three forced expirations shall be carried out. During the maneuvers, the patient shall be observed for compliance with instruction. The expirations shall be checked visually for reproducibility from flow-volume or volume-time tracings or displays. The following efforts shall be judged unacceptable when the patient:

1. Has not reached full inspiration preceding the forced expiration,

2. Has not used maximal effort during the entire forced expiration,

3. Has not continued the expiration for at least 5 seconds or until an obvious plateau in the volume time curve has occurred,

4. Has coughed or closed his glottis,

5. Has an obstructed mouthpiece or a leak around the mouthpiece (obstruction due to tongue being placed in front of mouthpiece, false teeth falling in front of mouthpiece, etc.)

6. Has an unsatisfactory start of expiration, one characterized by excessive hesitation (or false starts), and therefore not allowing back extrapolation of time 0 (extrapolated volume on the volume time tracing must be less than 10 percent of the FVC.)

7. Has an excessive variability between the three acceptable curves. The variation between the two largest FVC's and FEV1's of the three satisfactory tracings should not exceed 10 percent or ±100 milliliters, whichever is greater.

b. Periodic and routine recalibration of the instrument or method for recording FVC and FEV1.0 should be performed using a syringe or other volume source of at least 2 liters.

iii. interpretation of spirogram

a. The first step in evaluating a spirogram should be to determine whether or not the patient has performed the test properly or as described in II above. From the three satisfactory tracings, the forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1.0) shall be measured and recorded. The largest observed FVC and largest observed FEV1 shall be used in the analysis regardless of the curve(s) on which they occur.

b. The following guidelines are recommended by NIOSH for the evaluation and management of workers exposed to cotton dust. It is important to note that employees who show reductions in FEV1/FVC ratio below .75 or drops in Monday FEV1 of 5 percent or greater on their initial screening exam, should be re-evaluated within a month of the first exam. Those who show consistent decrease in lung function, as shown on the following table, should be managed as recommended.

iv. qualifications of personnel administering the test

Technicians who perform pulmonary function testing should have the basic knowledge required to produce meaningful results. Training consisting of approximately 16 hours of formal instruction should cover the following areas.

a. Basic physiology of the forced vital capacity maneuver and the determinants of airflow limitation with emphasis on the relation to reproducibility of results.

b. Instrumentation requirements including calibration procedures, sources of error and their correction.

c. Performance of the testing including subject coaching, recognition of improperly performed maneuvers and corrective actions.

d. Data quality with emphasis on reproducibility.

e. Actual use of the equipment under supervised conditions.

f. Measurement of tracings and calculations of results.

Appendix E to § 1910.1043 - Vertical Elutriator Equivalency Protocol

a. *Samples to be taken* - In order to ascertain equivalency, it is necessary to collect a total of 100 samples from at least 10 sites in a mill. That is, there should be 10 replicate readings at each of 10 sites. The sites should represent dust levels which vary over the allowable range of 0.5 to 2 times the permissible exposure limit. Each sample requires the use of two vertical elutriators (VE's) and at least one but not more than two alternative devices (AD's). Thus, the end result is 200 VE readings and either 100 or 200 AD readings. The 2 VE readings and the 1 or 2 AD readings at each time and site must be made simultaneously. That is, the two VE's and one or two AD's must be arranged together in such a way that they are measuring essentially the same dust levels.

b. *Data averaging* - The two VE readings taken at each site are then averaged. These averages are to be used as the 100 VE readings. If two alternate devices were used, their test results are also averaged. Thus, after this step is accomplished, there will be 100 VE readings and 100 AD readings.

c. *Differences* - For each of the 100 sets of measurements (VE and AD) the difference is obtained as the average VE reading minus the AD reading. Call these differences Di. Thus, we have.

Di = VEi − ADi, i = 1,2, . . . ,100 (1)

Next we compute the arithmetic mean and standard deviations of the differences, using equations (2) and (3), respectively.

where N equals the number of differences (100 in this case), XD is the arithmetic mean and SD is the standard deviation.

We next calculate the critical value as T = KSD + |XD| where K = 1.87, based on 100 samples.

d. *Equivalency test.* The next step is to obtain the average of the 100 VE readings. This is obtained by equation (4)

We next multiply 0.25 by XVE. If T ≤0.25 XVE, we can say that the alternate device has passed the equivalency test.
