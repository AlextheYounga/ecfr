(*1*) When the employee no longer shows signs or symptoms of exposure to MDA, or upon the advice of the physician.

(*2*) When a subsequent final medical determination results in a medical finding, determination, or opinion that the employee no longer has a detected medical condition which places the employee at increased risk of material impairment to health from exposure to MDA.

(B) For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer return an employee to his or her former job status is not intended to expand upon or restrict any rights an employee has or would have had, absent temporary medical removal, to a specific job classification or position under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.

(iii) *Removal of other employee special protective measure or limitations.* The employer shall remove any limitations placed on an employee, or end any special protective measures provided to an employee, pursuant to a final medical determination, when a subsequent final medical determination indicates that the limitations or special protective measures are no longer necessary.

(iv) *Employer options pending a final medical determination.* Where the physician review mechanism used pursuant to the medical surveillance provisions of this section, has not yet resulted in a final medical determination with respect to an employee, the employer shall act as follows:

(A) *Removal.* The employer may remove the employee from exposure to MDA, provide special protective measures to the employee, or place limitations upon the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status.

(B) *Return.* The employer may return the employee to his or her former job status, and end any special protective measures provided to the employee, consistent with the medical findings, determinations, or recommendations of any of the physicians who have reviewed the employee's health status, with two exceptions.

(*1*) If the initial removal, special protection, or limitation of the employee resulted from a final medical determination which differed from the findings, determinations, or recommendations of the initial physician; or

(*2*) If the employee has been on removal status for the preceding six months as a result of exposure to MDA, then the employer shall await a final medical determination.

(v) *Medical removal protection benefits*—(A) *Provisions of medical removal protection benefits.* The employer shall provide to an employee up to six (6) months of medical removal protection benefits on each occasion that an employee is removed from exposure to MDA or otherwise limited pursuant to this section.

(B) *Definition of medical removal protection benefits.* For the purposes of this section, the requirement that an employer provide medical removal protection benefits means that the employer shall maintain the earnings, seniority, and other employment rights and benefits of an employee as though the employee had not been removed from normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited.

(C) *Follow-up medical surveillance during the period of employee removal or limitations.* During the period of time that an employee is removed from normal exposure to MDA or otherwise limited, the employer may condition the provision of medical removal protection benefits upon the employee's participation in follow-up medical surveillance made available pursuant to this section.

(D) *Workers' compensation claims.* If a removed employee files a claim for workers' compensation payments for a MDA-related disability, then the employer shall continue to provide medical removal protection benefits pending disposition of the claim. To the extent that an award is made to the employee for earnings lost during the period of removal, the employer's medical removal protection obligation shall be reduced by such amount. The employer shall receive no credit for workers' compensation payments received by the employee for treatment-related expenses.

(E) *Other credits.* The employer's obligation to provide medical removal protection benefits to a removed employee shall be reduced to the extent that the employee receives compensation for earnings lost during the period of removal either from a publicly or employer-funded compensation program, or receives income from non-MDA-related employment with any employer made possible by virtue of the employee's removal.

(F) *Employees who do not recover within the 6 months of removal.* The employer shall take the following measures with respect to any employee removed from exposure to MDA:

(*1*) The employer shall make available to the employee a medical examination pursuant to this section to obtain a final medical determination with respect to the employee;

(*2*) The employer shall assure that the final medical determination obtained indicates whether or not the employee may be returned to his or her former job status, and, if not, what steps should be taken to protect the employee's health;

(*3*) Where the final medical determination has not yet been obtained, or, once obtained indicates that the employee may not yet be returned to his or her former job status, the employer shall continue to provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee until either the employee is returned to former job status, or a final medical determination is made that the employee is incapable of ever safely returning to his or her former job status; and

(*4*) Where the employer acts pursuant to a final medical determination which permits the return of the employee to his or her former job status, despite what would otherwise be an abnormal liver function test, later questions concerning removing the employee again shall be decided by a final medical determination. The employer need not automatically remove such an employee pursuant to the MDA removal criteria provided by this section.

(vi) *Voluntary removal or restriction of an employee.* Where an employer, although not required by this section to do so, removes an employee from exposure to MDA or otherwise places limitations on an employee due to the effects of MDA exposure on the employee's medical condition, the employer shall provide medical removal protection benefits to the employee equal to that required by paragraph (m)(9)(v) of this section.

1. Airborne: Ten parts per billion parts of air (10 ppb), time-weighted average (TWA) for an 8-hour workday and an action level of five parts per billion parts of air (5 ppb).

2. Dermal: Eye contact and skin contact with MDA are not permitted.

C. Appearance and odor: White to tan solid; amine odor

II. Health Hazard Data

A. *Ways in which MDA affects your health.* MDA can affect your health if you inhale it, or if it comes in contact with your skin or eyes. MDA is also harmful if you happen to swallow it. Do not get MDA in eyes, on skin, or on clothing.

B. *Effects of overexposure.* 1. Short-term (acute) overexposure: Overexposure to MDA may produce fever, chills, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice. Contact may irritate skin, eyes and mucous membranes. Sensitization may occur.

2. *Long-term (chronic) exposure.* Repeated or prolonged exposure to MDA, even at relatively low concentrations, may cause cancer. In addition, damage to the liver, kidneys, blood, and spleen may occur with long term exposure.

3. *Reporting signs and symptoms.* You should inform your employer if you develop any signs or symptoms which you suspect are caused by exposure to MDA including yellow staining of the skin.

III. Protective Clothing and Equipment

A. Respirators. Respirators are required for those operations in which engineering controls or work-practice controls are not adequate or feasible to reduce exposure to the permissible limit. If respirators are worn, they must have a label issued by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health under the provisions of 42 CFR part 84 stating that the respirators have been approved for this purpose, and cartridges and canisters must be replaced in accordance with the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.134. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, you can request a positive-pressure respirator from your employer. You must be thoroughly trained to use the assigned respirator, and the training must be provided by your employer.

MDA does not have a detectable odor except at levels well above the permissible exposure limits. Do not depend on odor to warn you when a respirator canister is exhausted. If you can smell MDA while wearing a respirator, proceed immediately to fresh air. If you experience difficulty breathing while wearing a respirator, tell your employer.

B. *Protective Clothing.* You may be required to wear coveralls, aprons, gloves, face shields, or other appropriate protective clothing to prevent skin contact with MDA. Where protective clothing is required, your employer is required to provide clean garments to you, as necessary, to assure that the clothing protects you adequately. Replace or repair impervious clothing that has developed leaks.

MDA should never be allowed to remain on the skin. Clothing and shoes which are not impervious to MDA should not be allowed to become contaminated with MDA, and if they do, the clothing and shoes should be promptly removed and decontaminated. The clothing should be laundered to remove MDA or discarded. Once MDA penetrates shoes or other leather articles, they should not be worn again.

C. *Eye protection.* You must wear splashproof safety goggles in areas where liquid MDA may contact your eyes. Contact lenses should not be worn in areas where eye contact with MDA can occur. In addition, you must wear a face shield if your face could be splashed with MDA liquid.

IV. Emergency and First Aid Procedures

A. *Eye and face exposure.* If MDA is splashed into the eyes, wash the eyes for at least 15 minutes. See a doctor as soon as possible.

B. *Skin exposure.* If MDA is spilled on your clothing or skin, remove the contaminated clothing and wash the exposed skin with large amounts of soap and water immediately. Wash contaminated clothing before you wear it again.

C. *Breathing.* If you or any other person breathes in large amounts of MDA, get the exposed person to fresh air at once. Apply artificial respiration if breathing has stopped. Call for medical assistance or a doctor as soon as possible. Never enter any vessel or confined space where the MDA concentration might be high without proper safety equipment and at least one other person present who will stay outside. A life line should be used.

D. *Swallowing.* If MDA has been swallowed and the patient is conscious, do not induce vomiting. Call for medical assistance or a doctor immediately.

V. Medical Requirements

If you are exposed to MDA at a concentration at or above the action level for more than 30 days per year, or exposed to liquid mixtures more than 15 days per year, your employer is required to provide a medical examination, including a medical history and laboratory tests, within 60 days of the effective date of this standard and annually thereafter. These tests shall be provided without cost to you. In addition, if you are accidentally exposed to MDA (either by ingestion, inhalation, or skin/eye contact) under conditions known or suspected to constitute toxic exposure to MDA, your employer is required to make special examinations and tests available to you.

VI. Observation of Monitoring

Your employer is required to perform measurements that are representative of your exposure to MDA and you or your designated representative are entitled to observe the monitoring procedure. You are entitled to observe the steps taken in the measurement procedure and to record the results obtained. When the monitoring procedure is taking place in an area where respirators or personal protective clothing and equipment are required to be worn, you and your representative must also be provided with, and must wear, the protective clothing and equipment.

VII. Access to Records

You or your representative are entitled to see the records of measurements of your exposure to MDA upon written request to your employer. Your medical examination records can be furnished to your physician or designated representative upon request by you to your employer.

VIII. Precautions for Safe Use, Handling and Storage

A. *Material is combustible.* Avoid strong acids and their anhydrides. Avoid strong oxidants. Consult supervisor for disposal requirements.

B. *Emergency clean-up.* Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and fully clothe the body in the appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment.

VIII. Common Operations

Common operations in which exposure to MDA is likely to occur include the following: Manufacture of MDA; Manufacture of Methylene diisocyanate; Curing agent for epoxy resin structures; Wire coating operations; and filament winding.

Appendix C to § 1910.1050—Medical Surveillance Guidelines for MDAI. Route of Entry

Inhalation; skin absorption; ingestion. MDA can be inhaled, absorbed through the skin, or ingested.

II. Toxicology

MDA is a suspect carcinogen in humans. There are several reports of liver disease in humans and animals resulting from acute exposure to MDA. A well documented case of an acute cardiomyopathy secondary to exposure to MDA is on record. Numerous human cases of hepatitis secondary to MDA are known. Upon direct contact MDA may also cause damage to the eyes. Dermatitis and skin sensitization have been observed. Almost all forms of acute environmental hepatic injury in humans involve the hepatic parenchyma and produce hepatocellular jaundice. This agent produces intrahepatic cholestasis. The clinical picture consists of cholestatic jaundice, preceded or accompanied by abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Onset in about 60% of all observed cases is abrupt with severe abdominal pain. In about 30% of observed cases, the illness presented and evolved more slowly and less dramatically, with only slight abdominal pain. In about 10% of the cases only jaundice was evident. The cholestatic nature of the jaundice is evident in the prominence of itching, the histologic predominance of bile stasis, and portal inflammatory infiltration, accompanied by only slight parenchymal injury in most cases, and by the moderately elevated transaminase values. Acute, high doses, however, have been known to cause hepatocellular damage resulting in elevated SGPT, SGOT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin.

Absorption through the skin is rapid. MDA is metabolized and excreted over a 48-hour period. Direct contact may be irritating to the skin, causing dermatitis. Also MDA which is deposited on the skin is not thoroughly removed through washing.

MDA may cause bladder cancer in humans. Animal data supporting this assumption is not available nor is conclusive human data. However, human data collected on workers at a helicopter manufacturing facility where MDA is used suggests a higher incidence of bladder cancer among exposed workers.

III. Signs and Symptoms

Skin may become yellow from contact with MDA.

Repeated or prolonged contact with MDA may result in recurring dermatitis (red-itchy, cracked skin) and eye irritation. Inhalation, ingestion or absorption through the skin at high concentrations may result in hepatitis, causing symptoms such as fever and chills, nausea and vomiting, dark urine, anorexia, rash, right upper quadrant pain and jaundice. Corneal burns may occur when MDA is splashed in the eyes.

IV. Treatment of Acute Toxic Effects/Emergency Situation

If MDA gets into the eyes, immediately wash eyes with large amounts of water. If MDA is splashed on the skin, immediately wash contaminated skin with mild soap or detergent. Employee should be removed from exposure and given proper medical treatment. Medical tests required under the emergency section of the medical surveillance section (M)(4) must be conducted.

If the chemical is swallowed do not induce vomiting but remove by gastric lavage.

Appendix D to § 1910.1050—Sampling and Analytical Methods for MDA Monitoring and Measurement Procedures

Measurements taken for the purpose of determining employee exposure to MDA are best taken so that the representative average 8-hour exposure may be determined from a single 8-hour sample or two (2) 4-hour samples. Short-time interval samples (or grab samples) may also be used to determine average exposure level if a minimum of five measurements are taken in a random manner over the 8-hour work shift. Random sampling means that any portion of the work shift has the same chance of being sampled as any other. The arithmetic average of all such random samples taken on one work shift is an estimate of an employee's average level of exposure for that work shift. Air samples should be taken in the employee's breathing zone (air that would most nearly represent that inhaled by the employee).

There are a number of methods available for monitoring employee exposures to MDA. The method OSHA currently uses is included below.

The employer, however, has the obligation of selecting any monitoring method which meets the accuracy and precision requirements of the standard under his unique field conditions. The standard requires that the method of monitoring must have an accuracy, to a 95 percent confidence level, of not less than plus or minus 25 percent for the select PEL.

OSHA MethodologySampling ProcedureApparatus

Samples are collected by use of a personal sampling pump that can be calibrated within ±5% of the recommended flow rate with the sampling filter in line.

Samples are collected on 37 mm Gelman type A/E glass fiber filters treated with sulfuric acid. The filters are prepared by soaking each filter with 0.5 mL of 0.26N H2 SO4. (0.26 N H2 SO4 can be prepared by diluting 1.5 mL of 36N H2 SO4 to 200 mL with deionized water.) The filters are dried in an oven at 100 degrees C for one hour and then assembled into two-piece 37 mm polystyrene cassettes with backup pads. The cassettes are sealed with shrink bands and the ends are plugged with plastic plugs.

After sampling, the filters are carefully removed from the cassettes and individually transferred to small vials containing approximately 2 mL deionized water. The vials must be tightly sealed. The water can be added before or after the filters are transferred. The vials must be sealable and capable of holding at least 7 mL of liquid. Small glass scintillation vials with caps containing Teflon liners are recommended.

Reagents

Deionized water is needed for addition to the vials.

Sampling Technique

Immediately before sampling, remove the plastic plugs from the filter cassettes.

Attach the cassette to the sampling pump with flexible tubing and place the cassette in the employee's breathing zone.

After sampling, seal the cassettes with plastic plugs until the filters are transferred to the vials containing deionized water.

At some convenient time within 10 hours of sampling, transfer the sample filters to vials.

Seal the small vials lengthwise.

Submit at least one blank filter with each sample set. Blanks should be handled in the same manner as samples, but no air is drawn through them.

Record sample volumes (in L of air) for each sample, along with any potential interferences.

Retention Efficiency

A retention efficiency study was performed by drawing 100 L of air (80% relative humidity) at 1 L/min through sample filters that had been spiked with 0.814 µg MDA. Instead of using backup pads, blank acid-treated filters were used as backups in each cassette. Upon analysis, the top filters were found to have an average of 91.8% of the spiked amount. There was no MDA found on the bottom filters, so the amount lost was probably due to the slight instability of the MDA salt.

Extraction Efficiency

The average extraction efficiency for six filters spiked at the target concentration is 99.6%.

The stability of extracted and derivatized samples was verified by reanalyzing the above six samples the next day using fresh standards. The average extraction efficiency for the reanalyzed samples is 98.7%.

Recommended Air Volume and Sampling Rate

The recommended air volume is 100 L.

The recommended sampling rate is 1 L/min.

Interferences (Sampling)

MDI appears to be a positive interference. It was found that when MDI was spiked onto an acid-treated filter, the MDI converted to MDA after air was drawn through it.

Suspected interferences should be reported to the laboratory with submitted samples.

Safety Precautions (Sampling)

Attach the sampling equipment to the employees so that it will not interfere with work performance or safety.

Follow all safety procedures that apply to the work area being sampled.

Analytical Procedure

Apparatus: The following are required for analysis.

A GC equipped with an electron capture detector. For this evaluation a Tracor 222 Gas Chromatograph equipped with a Nickel 63 High Temperature Electron Capture Detector and a Linearizer was used.

A GC column capable of separating the MDA derivative from the solvent and interferences. A 6 ft × 2 mm ID glass column packed with 3% OV-101 coated on 100/120 Gas Chrom Q was used in this evaluation.

A electronic integrator or some other suitable means of measuring peak areas or heights.

Small resealable vials with Teflon-lined caps capable of holding 4 mL.

A dispenser or pipet for toluene capable of delivering 2.0 mL.

Pipets (or repipets with plastic or Teflon tips) capable of delivering 1 mL for the sodium hydroxide and buffer solutions.

A repipet capable of delivering 25 µL HFAA.

Syringes for preparation of standards and injection of standards and samples into a GC.

Volumetric flasks and pipets to dilute the pure MDA in preparation of standards.

Disposable pipets to transfer the toluene layers after the samples are extracted.

Reagents

0.5 NaOH prepared from reagent grade NaOH.

Toluene, pesticide grade. Burdick and Jackson distilled in glass toluene was used.

Heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride (HFAA). HFAA from Pierce Chemical Company was used.

pH 7.0 phosphate buffer, prepared from 136 g potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 1 L deionized water. The pH is adjusted to 7.0 with saturated sodium hydroxide solution.

4,4′ -Methylenedianiline (MDA), reagent grade.

Standard Preparation

Concentrated stock standards are prepared by diluting pure MDA with toluene. Analytical standards are prepared by injecting uL amounts of diluted stock standards into vials that contain 2.0 mL toluene.

25 uL HFAA are added to each vial and the vials are capped and shaken for 10 seconds.

After 10 min, 1 mL of buffer is added to each vial.

The vials are recapped and shaken for 10 seconds.

After allowing the layers to separate, aliquots of the toluene (upper) layers are removed with a syringe and analyzed by GC.

Analytical standard concentrations should bracket sample concentrations. Thus, if samples fall out of the range of prepared standards, additional standards must be prepared to ascertain detector response.

Sample Preparation

The sample filters are received in vials containing deionized water.

1 mL of 0.5N NaOH and 2.0 mL toluene are added to each vial.

The vials are recapped and shaken for 10 min.

After allowing the layers to separate, approximately 1 mL aliquots of the toluene (upper) layers are transferred to separate vials with clean disposable pipets.

The toluene layers are treated and analyzed.

AnalysisGC conditionsZone temperatures:Column—220 degrees CInjector—235 degrees CDetector—335 degrees CGas flows, Ar/CH4 Column—28 mL/min(95/5) Purge—40 mL/minInjection volume: 5.0 uLColumn: 6 ft ×1/8 in ID glass, 3% OV-101 on 100/120 Gas Chrom QRetention time of MDA derivative: 3.5 minChromatogram

Peak areas or heights are measured by an integrator or other suitable means.

A calibration curve is constructed by plotting response (peak areas or heights) of standard injections versus ug of MDA per sample. Sample concentrations must be bracketed by standards.

Interferences (Analytical)

Any compound that gives an electron capture detector response and has the same general retention time as the HFAA derivative of MDA is a potential interference. Suspected interferences reported to the laboratory with submitted samples by the industrial hygienist must be considered before samples are derivatized.

GC parameters may be changed to possibly circumvent interferences.

Retention time on a single column is not considered proof of chemical identity. Analyte identity should be confirmed by GC/MS if possible.

Calculations

The analyte concentration for samples is obtained from the calibration curve in terms of ug MDA per sample. The extraction efficiency is 100%. If any MDA is found on the blank, that amount is subtracted from the sample amounts. The air concentrations are calculated using the following formulae.

µg/m3 = (µg MDA per sample) (1000)/(L of air sampled)ppb = (µg/m3) (24.46) / (198.3) = (µg/m3) (0.1233) where 24.46 is the molar volume at 25 degrees C and 760 mm HgSafety Precautions (Analytical)

Avoid skin contact and inhalation of all chemicals.

Restrict the use of all chemicals to a fume hood if possible.

Wear safety glasses and a lab coat at all times while in the lab area.
