##### ยง 1960.67 Federal agency certification of the injury and illness annual summary (OSHA 300-A or equivalent). #####

As required by 29 CFR 1904.32, a company executive must certify that he or she has examined the OSHA 300 Log and that he or she believes, based on his or her knowledge of the process by which the information was recorded, that the annual summary is correct and complete. For Federal establishments, the person who performs the certification shall be one of the following:

(a) The senior establishment management official,

(b) The head of the Agency for which the senior establishment management official works, or

(c) Any management official who is in the direct chain of command between the senior establishment management official and the head of the Agency.

Note to ยง 1960.67:

The requirement for certification of Federal agency injury and illness records in this section is necessary because the private sector position titles contained in 29 CFR part 1904 do not fit the Federal agency position titles for agency executives. The Federal officials listed in this section are intended to be the equivalent of the private sector officials who are required to certify records under ยง 1904.32(b)(4).
