##### ยง 90.17 Termination of certification of eligibility. #####

(a) *Investigation.* Whenever the Director of the Division of Trade Adjustment Assistance has reason to believe, with respect to any certification of eligibility, that the total or partial separations from a firm or appropriate subdivision thereof are no longer attributable to the conditions specified in section 222 of the Act and ยง 90.16(b), the Director shall promptly make an investigation. Notice of the initiation of the investigation shall be published in the Federal Register and shall be transmitted to the group of workers concerned.

(b) *Opportunity for comment and hearing.* Within 10 days after publication of the notice under paragraph (a) of this section, the group of workers or other persons showing a substantial interest in the proceedings may request a public hearing or may make written submissions to show why the certification should not be terminated. If a hearing is requested under this paragraph, such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with ยง 90.13.

Upon reaching a determination that the certification of eligibility shall be terminated, the certifying officer shall make findings of fact and shall promptly have published in the Federal Register a summary of the determination and the reasons therefor (with the exception of information which the certifying officer determines to be confidential). Such summary shall constitute a Notice of Termination. Such termination shall apply only with respect to total or partial separations occurring after the termination date specified by the certifying officer. The termination date specified by the certifying officer shall be not sooner than the date on which notice of such termination is published in the Federal Register.

(e) *Notice of partial termination.* A notice of termination may cover only a portion of the group of workers specified in the certification. Such notice shall constitute a Notice of Partial Termination.

(f) *Notice of continuation of certification.* Upon reaching a determination that the certification of eligibility should be continued, the certifying officer shall promptly publish in the Federal Register a summary of the determination with the reasons therefor. Such summary shall constitute a Notice of Continuation of Certification.
