##### ยง 2.37 Effect of DOL support on Title VII employment nondiscrimination requirements and on other existing statutes. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 82141, Dec. 17, 2020.

A religious organization's exemption from the Federal prohibition on employment discrimination on the basis of religion, set forth in ยง 702(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-1, is not forfeited when the organization receives direct or indirect DOL support. Some DOL programs, however, were established through Federal statutes containing independent statutory provisions requiring that recipients refrain from discriminating on the basis of religion. Accordingly, to determine the scope of any applicable requirements, recipients and potential recipients should consult with the appropriate DOL program official or with the Civil Rights Center, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., Room N4123, Washington, DC 20210, (202) 693-6500.
