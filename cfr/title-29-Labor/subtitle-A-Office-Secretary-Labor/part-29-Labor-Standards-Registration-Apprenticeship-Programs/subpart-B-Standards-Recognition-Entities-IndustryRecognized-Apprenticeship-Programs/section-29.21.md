##### § 29.21 Becoming a Standards Recognition Entity. #####

(a) To apply to be recognized as an SRE, an entity (or consortium or partnership of entities) must complete and submit an application to the Administrator for recognition as an IRAP SRE. Such application must be in a form prescribed by the Administrator, which will require the applicant's written attestation that the information and documentation provided is true and correct. This application must include all policies and procedures required by this subpart or addressing requirements in this subpart, which will be reviewed by the Administrator when making a recognition determination.

(b) An entity is qualified to be recognized as an SRE if it demonstrates:

(1) It has the expertise to set competency-based standards, through a consensus-based process involving industry experts, for the requisite training, structure, and curricula for apprenticeship programs in the industry(ies) or occupational area(s) in which it seeks to be an SRE.

(i) The requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be met through an SRE's past or current standard-setting activities and need only engender new activity if necessary to comply with this rule.

(ii) [Reserved]

(2) It has the capacity and quality assurance processes and procedures sufficient to comply with § 29.22(a)(4), given the scope of the IRAPs to be recognized.

(3) It has the resources to operate as an SRE for a 5-year period. As part of its application, an entity must report any bankruptcies from the past 5 years.

(4) Its disclosure of any confirmed or potential partner who will be engaged in the recognition activities and describes their roles, including relationships with subsidiaries or other related entities that could reasonably impact its impartiality.

(5) It is not suspended or debarred from conducting business with the U.S. Federal Government.

(6) It mitigates - via any specific policies, processes, procedures, or structures - any actual or potential conflicts of interest, including, but not limited to, conflicts that may arise from the entity recognizing its own apprenticeship program(s) and conflicts relating to the entity's provision of services to actual or prospective IRAPs.

(7) It has the appropriate knowledge and resources to recognize IRAPs in the industry(ies) or occupational areas in the intended geographical area, that may be nationwide or limited to a region, State, or local area.

(8) It meets any other applicable requirements of this subpart.

(c) The Administrator will recognize an entity as an SRE if it is qualified under paragraph (b) of this section.

(1) An SRE will be recognized for 5 years, and must reapply at least 6 months before the date that its current recognition is set to expire if it seeks re-recognition.

(i) To reapply to continue serving as an SRE, an entity must complete and submit an updated application to the Administrator for re-recognition as an IRAP SRE that is in a form prescribed by the Administrator.

(ii) To determine whether re-recognition should be granted, the Administrator will evaluate the information provided by the SRE in the updated application and the data provided pursuant to § 29.22(h), to verify that the SRE's quality assurance processes and procedures were and continue to be sufficient to effect compliance with § 29.22(a)(4).

(2) An SRE must notify the Administrator and must provide all related material information if:

(i) It makes any major change that could affect the operations of the program, such as involvement in lawsuits that materially affect the SRE, changes in legal status, or any other change that materially affects the SRE's ability to function in its recognition capacity; or

(ii) It seeks to recognize apprenticeship programs in additional industries, occupational areas, or geographical areas.

(3) An SRE must submit changes as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section to the Administrator for evaluation prior to the SRE implementing the changes. In light of the information received, the Administrator will evaluate whether the SRE remains qualified for recognition under paragraph (b) of this section, including its qualification to recognize programs in the new industries, occupational areas, or geographical areas identified under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

(d) The requirements for denials of recognition are as follows:

(1) A denial of recognition must be in writing and must state the reason(s) for denial. The notice must tell the applicant what it needs to do differently before resubmitting its application.

(2) The notice must state that a request for administrative review may be made within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice.

(3) The notice must explain that a request for administrative review must comply with the service requirements contained in 29 CFR part 18. The Administrator will refer any requests for administrative review to the Office of Administrative Law Judges to be addressed in accordance with § 29.29.
