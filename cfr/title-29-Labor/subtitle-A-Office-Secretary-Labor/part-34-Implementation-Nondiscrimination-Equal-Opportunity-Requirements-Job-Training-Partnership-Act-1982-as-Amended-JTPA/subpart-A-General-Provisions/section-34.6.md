##### ยง 34.6 Communications with individuals with disabilities. #####

(a) Recipients shall take appropriate steps to ensure that communications with beneficiaries, applicants, eligible applicants, participants, applicants for employment, employees and members of the public who are individuals with disabilities, are as effective as communications with others.

(b) A recipient shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids or services where necessary to afford individuals with disabilities an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, the JTPA-funded program or activity. In determining what type of auxiliary aid or service is necessary, such recipient shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with a disability.

(c) Where a recipient communicates with beneficiaries, applicants, eligible applicants, participants, applicants for employment and employees by telephone, telecommunications devices for individuals with hearing impairments (TDDs), or equally effective communications systems shall be used.

(d) A recipient shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with visual or hearing impairments, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.

(e) A recipient shall provide signage at a primary entrance to each of its inaccessible facilities, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.

(f) This section does not require a recipient to take any action that it can demonstrate would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a service, program, or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens.

(1) In those circumstances where a recipient believes that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the JTPA-funded program, activity, or service, or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, such recipient has the burden of proving that compliance with this section would result in such alteration or burdens.

(2) The decision that compliance would result in such alteration or burdens must be made by the recipient after considering all resources available for use in the funding and operation of the JTPA-funded program, activity, or service and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion.

(3) If an action required to comply with this section would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the recipient shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with disabilities receive the benefits or services provided by the recipient.
