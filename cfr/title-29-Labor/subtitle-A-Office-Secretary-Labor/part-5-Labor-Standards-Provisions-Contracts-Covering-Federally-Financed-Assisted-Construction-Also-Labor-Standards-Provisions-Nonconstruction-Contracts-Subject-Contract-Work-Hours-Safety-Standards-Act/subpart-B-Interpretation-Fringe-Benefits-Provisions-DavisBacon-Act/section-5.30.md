##### ยง 5.30 Types of wage determinations. #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 57745, Aug. 23, 2023.

(a) When fringe benefits are prevailing for various classes of laborers and mechanics in the area of proposed construction, such benefits are includable in any Davis-Bacon wage determination. Illustrations, contained in paragraph (c) of this section, demonstrate some of the different types of wage determinations which may be made in such cases.

(b) Wage determinations of the Secretary of Labor under the act do not include fringe benefits for various classes of laborers and mechanics whenever such benefits do not prevail in the area of proposed construction. When this occurs the wage determination will contain only the basic hourly rates of pay, that is only the cash wages which are prevailing for the various classes of laborers and mechanics. An illustration of this situation is contained in paragraph (c) of this section.
