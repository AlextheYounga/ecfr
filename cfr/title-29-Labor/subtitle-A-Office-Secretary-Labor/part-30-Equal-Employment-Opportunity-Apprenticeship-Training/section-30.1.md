##### ยง 30.1 Scope and purpose. #####

This part sets forth policies and procedures to promote equality of opportunity in apprenticeship programs registered with the U.S. Department of Labor and in state apprenticeship programs registered with recognized state apprenticeship agencies. These policies and procedures apply to the recruitment and selection of apprentices, and to all conditions of employment and training during apprenticeship. The procedures established provide for review of apprenticeship programs, for registering apprenticeship programs, for processing complaints, and for deregistering noncomplying apprenticeship programs. This part also provides policies and procedures for continuation or withdrawal of recognition of state agencies for registering of apprenticeship programs for Federal purposes. The purpose of this part is to promote equality of opportunity in apprenticeship by prohibiting discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, or sex in apprenticeship programs, by requiring affirmative action to provide equal opportunity in such apprenticeship programs, and by coordinating this part with other equal opportunity programs.
