##### ยง 89.1 Scope of this part. #####

(a) Guidance documents can provide a valuable means for an agency, among other things, to interpret existing law or to clarify how it intends to enforce an existing legal requirement. However, unless law permits, guidance documents should not establish new requirements that the agency treats as binding; any such requirements should be issued pursuant to applicable notice and comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act or pursuant to other appropriate process under applicable law.

(b) This part governs the Department of Labor and its agencies involved with any phase(s) of developing, issuing, modifying, withdrawing, or using guidance documents.

(c) Except where other law or this part provide otherwise, the provisions of this part apply to guidance issued and modifications or withdrawals of existing guidance that occur after September 28, 2020.
