##### ยง 9.11 Contracting agency requirements. #####

(a) *Contract Clause.* The contract clause set forth in Appendix A of this part shall be included in covered service contracts, and solicitations for such contracts, that succeed contracts for performance of the same or similar services at the same location.

(b) *Notice.* Where a contract will be awarded to a successor for the same or similar services to be performed at the same location, the Contracting Officer will ensure that the predecessor contractor provide written notice to service employees of the predecessor contractor of their possible right to an offer of employment. Such notice shall be either posted in a conspicuous place at the worksite or delivered to the employees individually. Where the predecessor contractor's workforce is comprised of a significant portion of workers who are not fluent in English, the notice shall be provided in both English and a language with which the employees are more familiar. Multiple foreign language notices are required where significant portions of the workforce speak different foreign languages and there is no common language. Contracting Officers may advise contractors to provide the notice set forth in Appendix B to this part in either a physical posting at the job site, or another format that effectively provides individual notice such as individual paper notices or effective email notification to the affected employees. To be effective, email notification must result in an electronic delivery receipt or some other reliable confirmation that the intended recipient received the notice. Any particular determination of the adequacy of a notification, regardless of the method used, must be fact-dependent and made on a case-by-case basis.
