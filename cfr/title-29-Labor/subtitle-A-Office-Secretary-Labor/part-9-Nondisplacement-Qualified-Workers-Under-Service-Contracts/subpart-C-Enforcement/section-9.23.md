##### ยง 9.23 Wage and Hour Division investigation. #####

(a) *Initial investigation.* The Administrator may initiate an investigation under this part either as the result of the unsuccessful conciliation of a complaint or at any time on his or her own initiative. As part of the investigation, the Administrator may inspect the records of the predecessor and successor contractors (and make copies or transcriptions thereof), question the predecessor and successor contractors and any employees of these contractors, and require the production of any documentary or other evidence deemed necessary to determine whether a violation of this part (including conduct warranting imposition of ineligibility sanctions pursuant to ยง 9.24(d) of this part) has occurred.

(b) *Subsequent investigations.* The Administrator may conduct a new investigation or issue a new determination if the Administrator concludes circumstances warrant, such as where the proceedings before an Administrative Law Judge reveal that there may have been violations with respect to other employees of the contractor, where imposition of ineligibility sanctions is appropriate, or where the contractor has failed to comply with an order of the Secretary.
