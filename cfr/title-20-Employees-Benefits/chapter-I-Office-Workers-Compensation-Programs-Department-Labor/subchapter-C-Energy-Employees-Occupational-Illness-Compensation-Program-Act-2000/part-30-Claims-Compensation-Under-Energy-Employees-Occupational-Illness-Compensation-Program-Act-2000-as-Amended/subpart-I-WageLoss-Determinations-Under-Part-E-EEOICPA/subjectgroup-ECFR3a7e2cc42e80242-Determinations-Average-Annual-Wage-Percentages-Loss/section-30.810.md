##### § 30.810 How will OWCP calculate the average annual wage of a covered Part E employee? #####

To calculate the average annual wage of a covered Part E employee as defined in § 30.801(a), OWCP will:

(a) Aggregate the wages for the twelve quarters that preceded the quarter during which the covered Part E employee first experienced wage-loss due to exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility or a RECA section 5 facility, excluding any quarter during which the employee was unemployed;

(b) Add any additional wages earned by the employee during those same quarters as evidenced by records described in §§ 30.805(a) and 30.806;

(c) Divide the sum of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section by 12 less the number of quarters during which the employee was unemployed; and

(d) Multiply this figure by four to calculate the covered Part E employee's average annual wage.
