##### § 405.310 How to request a hearing before an administrative law judge. #####

(a) *Written request.* You must request a hearing by filing a written request. You should include in your request -

(1) Your name and social security number,

(2) If you have filed a claim for benefits based on disability under title II of the Act under an account other than your own, the name and social security number of the wage earner under whose account you are filing,

(3) The specific reasons you disagree with the previous determination,

(4) A statement of the medically determinable impairment(s) that you believe prevents you from working,

(5) Additional evidence that you have available to you, and

(6) The name and address of your representative, if any.

(b) *Time limit for filing request.* An administrative law judge will conduct a hearing if you request one in writing no later than 60 days after the date you receive notice of the reconsidered determination or an initial determination subject to a hearing by an administrative law judge under the procedures in this part as a result of § 404.906(b)(4) or § 416.1406(b)(4) of this chapter (or within the extended time period if we extend the time as provided in paragraph (d) of this section). The administrative law judge may decide your disability claim without an oral hearing under the circumstances described in § 405.340.

(c) *Place for filing request.* You should submit a written request for a hearing at one of our offices. If you have a disability claim under title II of the Act, you may also file the request at the Veterans Administration Regional Office in the Philippines, or if you have 10 or more years of service, or at least five years of service accruing after December 31, 1995, in the railroad industry, an office of the Railroad Retirement Board.

(d) *Extension of time to request a hearing.* If you want a hearing before an administrative law judge, but you do not request it timely, you may ask us for more time to request a hearing. Your request for an extension of time must be in writing and must give the reasons the request for review was not filed, or cannot be filed, in time. If you show us that you have good cause for missing the deadline, we will extend the time period. To determine whether good cause exists, we use the standards explained in § 405.20 of this part.

(e) *Waiver of the right to appear.* After you submit your request for a hearing, you may ask the administrative law judge to decide your claim without a hearing, as described in § 405.340(b). The administrative law judge may grant the request unless he or she believes that a hearing is necessary. You may withdraw this waiver of your right to appear at a hearing any time before notice of the hearing decision is mailed to you, and we will schedule a hearing as soon as practicable.
