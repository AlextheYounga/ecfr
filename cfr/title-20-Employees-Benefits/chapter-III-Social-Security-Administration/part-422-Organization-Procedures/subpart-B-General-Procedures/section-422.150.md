##### § 422.150 Guidelines for establishing and maintaining an information exchange with payroll data providers. #####

(a) *Guidelines for establishing an information exchange with payroll data providers.* In establishing an information exchange under section 1184 of the Social Security Act, we will do the following:

(1) Identify the payroll data providers (as defined in §§ 404.702 and 416.702 of this chapter) that may be interested in participating in an information exchange with us.

(2) Review the payroll data providers and consider factors such as: whether a payroll data provider is able and willing to engage in an information exchange; what data the payroll data provider could provide; whether the data from the payroll data provider is sufficiently accurate, complete, and up to date; and any conditions and limitations associated with our receipt of the data.

(3) Consistent with applicable law and regulations, establish an information exchange with the selected payroll data provider. The arrangement between us and the selected payroll data provider will describe:

(i) The records that will be matched;

(ii) The procedures for the match;

(iii) Any requirements established related to accuracy, completeness, and up-to-date records;

(iv) The procedures for ensuring the administrative, technical, and physical security of the records matched; and

(v) Such other provisions as are necessary.

(4) Prior to receiving payroll data provider information, publish a notice in the Federal Register that describes the information exchange and the extent to which the information received through such exchange is:

(i) Relevant and necessary to:

(A) Accurately determine initial and ongoing entitlement to, and the amount of, disability benefits under title II of the Social Security Act;

(B) Accurately determine eligibility for, and the amount of, benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program under title XVI of the Social Security Act; and

(C) Prevent improper payments of such benefits; and

(ii) Sufficiently accurate, up to date, and complete.

(b) *Guidelines for maintaining an information exchange with payroll data providers.* We will perform the following activities while we maintain an established information exchange with a payroll data provider described in paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) Periodically assess whether the data we receive under the information exchange continues to be accurate, complete, and up to date; and

(2) Monitor compliance with the requirements of the information exchange described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
