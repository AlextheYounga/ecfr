The rules in this part relate to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady Act), as amended by the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (NIAA) (Pub. L. 110-180). The Brady Act required the Attorney General to establish the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which allows a Federal firearms licensee to determine whether the law prohibits a potential buyer from possessing or receiving a firearm. Among other things, the NIAA requires a Federal agency that has any records demonstrating that a person falls within one of the categories in 18 U.S.C. 922(g) or (n) to report the pertinent information contained in the record to the Attorney General for inclusion in the NICS. The rules in this part define key terms and explain which records we will report to the NICS. They also explain how we will provide oral and written notification to our title II and title XVI beneficiaries who meet the requisite criteria. Finally, the rules in this part explain how beneficiaries who meet the requisite criteria may apply for relief from the Federal firearms prohibitions, and how we will process a request for relief.
