##### § 416.1140 The presumed value rule. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 21210, Mar. 27, 2024.

(a) *How we apply the presumed value rule.* (1) When you receive in-kind support and maintenance and the one-third reduction rule does not apply, we use the presumed value rule. Instead of determining the actual dollar value of any food or shelter you receive, we presume that it is worth a maximum value. This maximum value is one-third of your Federal benefit rate plus the amount of the general income exclusion described in § 416.1124(c)(12).

(2) The presumed value rule allows you to show that your in-kind support and maintenance is not equal to the presumed value. We will not use the presumed value if you show us that—

(i) The current market value of any food or shelter you receive, minus any payment you make for them, is lower than the presumed value; or

(ii) The actual amount someone else pays for your food or shelter is lower than the presumed value.

(b) *How we determine the amount of your unearned income under the presumed value rule.* (1) If you choose not to question the use of the presumed value, or if the presumed value is less than the actual value of the food or shelter you receive, we use the presumed value to figure your unearned income.

(2) If you show us, as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that the presumed value is higher than the actual value of the food or shelter you receive, we use the actual amount to figure your unearned income.
