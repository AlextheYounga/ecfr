##### § 416.1102 What is income? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 21209, Mar. 27, 2024.

Income is anything you receive in cash or in kind that you can use to meet your needs for food and shelter. Sometimes income also includes more or less than you actually receive (see §§ 416.1110 and 416.1123(b)). In-kind income is not cash, but is actually food or shelter, or something you can use to get one of these.
