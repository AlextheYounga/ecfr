##### § 416.709 Reduced reporting requirements when you authorize us to obtain your information from payroll data providers. #####

(a) *Authorization to obtain data from a payroll data provider.* We will ask you for written authorization to obtain information about you from a payroll data provider whenever we determine the information is needed in connection with a determination of initial or ongoing eligibility for benefits.

(b) *Scope and duration.* When we ask for your authorization, we will explain the authorization's scope and duration.

(1) We will explain to you that we will use information obtained from a payroll data provider, when it is needed, in connection with a determination of eligibility or the amount of benefits under this title, or for the initial or ongoing entitlement to disability benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, and to prevent improper payments. We will explain to you that we may also use the authorization to obtain wage and employment information from a payroll data provider for claims associated with the claim filed, such as an SSI claim by a spouse or child. We will also explain that we may use and disclose your information consistent with applicable Federal law (see part 401 of this chapter) and any privacy notices we provide to you.

(2) We will also inform you that your authorization will remain effective until the earliest of one of the following occurrences:

(i) You revoke your authorization in writing (see paragraph (c)(4) of this section);

(ii) We have terminated all eligibility for benefits and you have no other claims or appeals pending under this title, and the period for appealing the determination or decision terminating entitlement has lapsed;

(iii) There has been an adverse determination or decision on your claim, you have no other claims or appeals pending under this title, and the period for appealing the determination or decision terminating eligibility has lapsed; or

(iv) Your deeming relationship ends.

(c) *When reporting requirements will change.* We will notify you in writing whenever there is a change in your reporting responsibilities relating to the authorization described in paragraph (a) of this section. Whenever we are getting your wage and employment information from a payroll data provider, we will tell you that you are not subject to a penalty of ineligibility for cash benefits described in § 416.1340 related to any wage and employment information we get from a payroll data provider. We will also tell you when we will find good cause, under § 416.732, for a failure or delay in reporting a change in employer.

(1) If we have your authorization to obtain wage and employment information from a payroll data provider as described in paragraph (a) of this section, and we receive your wage and employment information from your employer(s) through a participating payroll data provider, you will not have to report changes in your wages paid in cash, as defined in § 416.1110(a), from that employer(s). Also, you will not have to report an increase in the amount of work from that employer or an increase in earnings from that employer, as described in § 416.988(a)(4) and (5). All other reporting requirements still apply.

(2) If we have your authorization to obtain wage and employment information from a payroll data provider as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but we do not receive your wage and employment information from your employer(s) through a participating payroll data provider, we will not reduce your reporting responsibilities.

(3) If we have your authorization to obtain wage and employment information from a payroll data provider as described in paragraph (a) of this section, and you have more than one employer,

(i) You do not need to report wages paid in cash, or an increase in the amount of work or earnings, for an employer if we receive your wage and employment information for that employer through a participating payroll data provider, and

(ii) You must still report wages paid in cash, or an increase in the amount of work or earnings, for an employer if we do not receive your wage and employment information for that employer through a participating payroll data provider.

(4) You may revoke your authorization at any time, but you must do so in writing. We will apply the revocation to all pending or approved claims under this title as well as all pending or approved disability claims under title II from the time we process your revocation. If you revoke your authorization, all your reporting responsibilities will resume; you will again be subject to all related penalties; and we may not find good cause, under § 416.732, for a failure to report timely a change in employer. We will notify you in writing of these changes.
