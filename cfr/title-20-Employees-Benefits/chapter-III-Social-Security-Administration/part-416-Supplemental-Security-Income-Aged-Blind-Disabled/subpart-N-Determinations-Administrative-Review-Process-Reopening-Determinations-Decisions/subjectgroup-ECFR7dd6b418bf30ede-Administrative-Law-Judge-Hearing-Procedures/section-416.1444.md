##### ยง 416.1444 Administrative law judge hearing procedures - general. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 90995, December 16, 2016.

A hearing is open to the parties and to other persons the administrative law judge considers necessary and proper. At the hearing the administrative law judge looks fully into the issues, questions you and the other witnesses, and accepts as evidence any documents that are material to the issues. The administrative law judge may stop the hearing temporarily and continue it at a later date if he or she believes that there is material evidence missing at the hearing. The administrative law judge may also reopen the hearing at any time before he or she mails a notice of the decision in order to receive new and material evidence. The administrative law judge may decide when the evidence will be presented and when the issues will be discussed.
