##### § 404.1616 Medical or psychological consultants. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 5873, Jan. 18, 2017.

(a) *What is a medical consultant?* A medical consultant is a person who is a member of a team that makes disability determinations in a State agency, as explained in § 404.1615, or who is a member of a team that makes disability determinations for us when we make disability determinations ourselves.

(b) *What qualifications must a medical consultant have?* A medical consultant must be an acceptable medical source identified in § 404.1513(a)(1) or (a)(3) through (a)(5); that is, a licensed physician (medical or osteopathic), a licensed optometrist, a licensed podiatrist, or a qualified speech-language pathologist. The medical consultant must meet any appropriate qualifications for his or her specialty as explained in § 404.1513(a).

(c) *Are there any limitations on what medical consultants who are not physicians can evaluate?* Medical consultants who are not physicians are limited to evaluating the impairments for which they are qualified, as described in § 404.1513(a). Medical consultants who are not physicians also are limited as to when they may serve as a member of a team that makes a disability determination. For example, a speech-language pathologist who is a medical consultant in a State agency may be a member of a team that makes a disability determination in a claim only if a speech or language impairment is the only impairment in the claim or if there is a combination of a speech or language impairment with another impairment but the speech or language impairment alone would justify a finding of disability. In all other cases, a physician will be a member of the team that makes a disability determination, except in cases in which this function may be performed by a psychological consultant as discussed in paragraph (f) of this section and § 404.1615(d).

(d) *What is a psychological consultant?* A psychological consultant is a psychologist who has the same responsibilities as a medical consultant explained in paragraph (a) of this section, but who can evaluate only mental impairments.

(e) *What qualifications must a psychological consultant have?* A psychological consultant used in cases where there is evidence of a mental impairment must be a qualified psychologist. For disability program purposes, a psychologist will not be considered qualified unless he or she:

(1) Is licensed or certified as a psychologist at the independent practice level of psychology by the State in which he or she practices; and

(2)(i) Possesses a doctorate degree in psychology from a program in clinical psychology of an educational institution accredited by an organization recognized by the Council on Post-Secondary Accreditation; or

(ii) Is listed in a national register of health service providers in psychology which the Commissioner of Social Security deems appropriate; and

(3) Possesses 2 years of supervised clinical experience as a psychologist in health service, at least 1 year of which is post masters degree.

(f) *Are there any limitations on what a psychological consultant can evaluate?* Psychological consultants are limited to the evaluation of mental impairments, as explained in § 404.1615(d). Psychological consultants also are limited as to when they can serve as a member of a team that makes a disability determination. They may do so only when a mental impairment is the only impairment in the claim or when there is a combination of a mental impairment with another impairment but the mental impairment alone would justify a finding of disability.
