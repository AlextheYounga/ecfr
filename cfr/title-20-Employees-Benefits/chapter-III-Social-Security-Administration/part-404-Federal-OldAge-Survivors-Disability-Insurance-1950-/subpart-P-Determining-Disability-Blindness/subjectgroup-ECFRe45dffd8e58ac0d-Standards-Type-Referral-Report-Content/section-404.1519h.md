##### § 404.1519h Your treating source. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 5866, Jan. 18, 2017.

When in our judgment your treating source is qualified, equipped, and willing to perform the additional examination or tests for the fee schedule payment, and generally furnishes complete and timely reports, your treating source will be the preferred source to do the purchased examination. Even if only a supplemental test is required, your treating source is ordinarily the preferred source.
