##### ยง 404.1504 Determinations by other organizations and agencies. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 5864, Jan. 18, 2017.

A decision by any nongovernmental agency or any other governmental agency about whether you are disabled or blind is based on its rules and is not our decision about whether you are disabled or blind. We must make a disability or blindness determination based on social security law. Therefore, a determination made by another agency that you are disabled or blind is not binding on us.
