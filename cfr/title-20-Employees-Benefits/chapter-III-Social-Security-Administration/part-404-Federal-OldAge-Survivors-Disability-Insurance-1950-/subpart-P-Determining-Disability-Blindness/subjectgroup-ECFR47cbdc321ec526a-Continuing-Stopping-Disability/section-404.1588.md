##### § 404.1588 Your responsibility to tell us of events that may change your disability status. #####

(a) *Your responsibility to report changes to us.* If you are entitled to cash benefits or to a period of disability because you are disabled, you should promptly tell us if—

(1) Your condition improves;

(2) You return to work;

(3) You have a new employer;

(4) You increase the amount of your work; or

(5) Your earnings increase.

(b) *Effect of authorizing us to obtain your information from payroll data providers.* (1) We will reduce your reporting responsibilities as described in paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) of this section if we have your authorization to obtain wage and employment information from a payroll data provider (see § 404.703), and we receive your wage and employment information from your employer(s) through a participating payroll data provider (see § 404.702). You will not be subject to a penalty described in § 404.459 related to any wage and employment information we receive from a payroll data provider.

(2) We will notify you in writing whenever there is a change in your reporting responsibilities relating to the authorization described in § 404.703. You are always required to submit any changes described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.

(3) When your reporting requirements will change—

(i) If we have your authorization to obtain wage and employment information from a payroll data provider (see § 404.703), and we receive your wage and employment information from your employer through a participating payroll data provider, you will not have to report an increase in the amount of work for that employer or an increase in earnings from that employer.

(ii) If we have your authorization to obtain wage and employment information from a payroll data provider (see § 404.703), but we do not receive your wage and employment information from your employer through a participating payroll data provider, we will not reduce your reporting responsibilities.

(iii) If we have your authorization to obtain wage and employment information from a payroll data provider (see § 404.703) and you have more than one employer:

(A) You do not need to report an increase in the amount of work or an increase in earnings for an employer if we receive your wage and employment information for that employer through a participating payroll data provider; and

(B) You must still report an increase in the amount of work or an increase in earnings for an employer if we do not receive your wage and employment information for that employer through a participating payroll data provider.

(4) You may revoke your authorization at any time, but you must do so in writing. We will apply the revocation to all pending or approved disability claims under this title, as well as all pending or approved claims under title XVI, from the time we process your revocation. If you revoke your authorization, all your reporting responsibilities will resume, and you will again be subject to all related penalties. We will notify you in writing of these changes.

(c) *Our responsibility when you report your work to us.* When you or your representative report changes in your work activity to us under paragraphs (a)(2) through (5) of this section, we will issue a receipt to you or your representative.
