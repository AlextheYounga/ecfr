(1) The specific issues to be decided in your case;

(2) That you may designate a person to represent you during the proceedings;

(3) How to request that we change the time or place of your hearing;

(4) That your hearing may be dismissed if neither you nor the person you designate to act as your representative appears at your scheduled hearing without good reason under § 404.957;

(5) Whether your appearance or that of any other party or witness is scheduled to be made by video teleconferencing, in person, or, when the circumstances described in § 404.936(c)(2) exist, by telephone.

If you tell us that you did not receive the notice of hearing, an amended notice will be sent to you by certified mail.

(d) *Amended notice of hearing or notice of supplemental hearing.* If we need to send you an amended notice of hearing, we will mail or serve the notice at least 20 days before the date of the hearing. Similarly, if we schedule a supplemental hearing, after the initial hearing was continued by the assigned administrative law judge, we will mail or serve a notice of hearing at least 20 days before the date of the hearing.
