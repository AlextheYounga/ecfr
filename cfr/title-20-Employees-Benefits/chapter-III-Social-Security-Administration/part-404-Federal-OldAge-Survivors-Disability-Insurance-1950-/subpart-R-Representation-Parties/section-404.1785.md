Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 30856, July 2, 2018.

(a) *General.* Generally, the Appeals Council will not consider evidence in addition to that introduced at the hearing. However, if the Appeals Council believes that the evidence offered is material to an issue it is considering, the evidence will be considered.

(b) *Individual charged filed an answer.* (1) When the Appeals Council believes that additional material evidence is available, and the representative has filed an answer to the charges, the Appeals Council shall require that the evidence be obtained. The Appeals Council may name an administrative law judge or a member of the Appeals Council to receive the evidence.

(2) Before additional evidence is admitted into the record, the Appeals Council shall mail a notice to the parties, telling them that evidence about certain issues will be obtained, unless the notice is waived. The Appeals Council shall give each party a reasonable opportunity to comment on the evidence and to present other evidence that is material to an issue it is considering.

(c) *Individual charged did not file an answer.* If the representative did not file an answer to the charges, the Appeals Council will not permit the introduction of evidence that was not considered at the hearing.
