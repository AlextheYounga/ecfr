##### § 220.105 Initial evaluation of a previous disability. #####

(a) In some cases, the Board may determine that a claimant is not currently disabled but was previously disabled for a specified period of time in the past. This can occur when—

(1) The disability application was filed before the claimant's disability ended but the Board did not make the initial determination of disability until after the claimant's disability ended; or

(2) The disability application was filed after the claimant's disability ended but no later than the 12th month after the month the disability ended.

(b) When evaluating a claim for a previous disability, the Board follows the steps in § 220.100 to determine whether a disability existed, and follows the steps in § 220.180 to determine when the disability ended.

Example 1.The claimant sustained multiple fractures to his left leg in an automobile accident which occurred on June 16, 1982. For a period of 18 months following the accident the claimant underwent 2 surgical procedures which restored the functional use of his leg. After a recovery period following the last surgery, the claimant returned to work on February 1, 1984.

The claimant, although fully recovered medically and regularly employed, filed an application on December 3, 1984 for a determination of disability for the period June 16, 1982 through January 31, 1984. The Board reviewed his claim in January 1985 and determined that he was disabled for the prior period which began June 16, 1982 and continued through January 31, 1984. A disability annuity is payable to the employee only for the period December 1, 1983 through January 31, 1984.

An annuity may not begin any earlier than the 1st of the 12th month before the month in which the application was filed (See part 218 of this chapter for the rules on when an annuity may begin).

Example 2:The claimant is disabled using the same medical facts disclosed above, beginning June 16, 1982 (the date of the automobile accident). The claimant files an application for a disability annuity, dated December 1, 1983. However, as of February 1, 1984, and before the Board makes a disability determination, the claimant returns to full-time work and is no longer considered disabled. The Board reviews the claimant's application in May 1984 and finds him disabled for the period June 16, 1982 through January 31, 1984. A disability annuity is payable to the employee from December 1, 1982 through January 31, 1984. (See part 218 of this chapter for the rules on when an annuity may begin).
