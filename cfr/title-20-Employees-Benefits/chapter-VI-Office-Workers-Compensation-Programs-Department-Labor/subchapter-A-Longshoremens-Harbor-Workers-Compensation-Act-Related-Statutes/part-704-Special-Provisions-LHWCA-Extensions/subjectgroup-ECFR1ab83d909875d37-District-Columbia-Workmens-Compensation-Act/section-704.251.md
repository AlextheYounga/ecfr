This endorsement shall not be canceled prior to the date specified in this policy for its expiration until at least 30 days have elapsed after a notice of cancellation has been sent to the District Director for the District of Columbia and to this employer.

All terms, conditions, requirements, and obligations expressed in this policy or in any other endorsement attached thereto which are not inconsistent with or inapplicable to the provisions of this endorsement are hereby made a part of this endorsement as fully and completely as if wholly written herein.
