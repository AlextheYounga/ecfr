##### § 617.22 Approval of training. #####

(a) *Conditions for approval.* Training shall be approved for an adversely affected worker if the State agency determines that:

(1) *There is no suitable employment (which may include technical and professional employment) available for an adversely affected worker.*

(i) This means that for the worker for whom approval of training is being considered under this section, no suitable employment is available at that time for that worker, either in the commuting area, as defined in § 617.3(k), or outside the commuting area in an area in which the worker desires to relocate with the assistance of a relocation allowance under subpart E of this part, and there is no reasonable prospect of such suitable employment becoming available for the worker in the foreseeable future. For the purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section only, the term “suitable employment” means, with respect to a worker, work of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the worker's past adversely affected employment, and wages for such work at not less that 80 percent of the worker's average weekly wage.

(2) *The worker would benefit from appropriate training.* (i) This means that there is a direct relationship between the needs of the worker for skills training or remedial education and what would be provided by the training program under consideration for the worker, and that the worker has the mental and physical capabilities to undertake, make satisfactory progress in, and complete the training. This includes the further criterion that the individual will be job ready on completion of the training program.

(3) *There is a reasonable expectation of employment following completion of such training.* (i) This means that, for that worker, given the job market conditions expected to exist at the time of the completion of the training program, there is, fairly and objectively considered, a reasonable expectation that the worker will find a job, using the skills and education acquired while in training, after completion of the training. Any determination under this criterion must take into account that “a reasonable expectation of employment” does not require that employment opportunities for the worker be available, or offered, immediately upon the completion of the approved training. This emphasizes, rather than negates, the point that there must be a fair and objective projection of job market conditions expected to exist at the time of completion of the training.

(4) *Training approved by the Secretary is reasonably available to the worker from either governmental agencies or private sources (which may include area vocational technical education schools, as defined in Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, and employers).* (i) This means that training is reasonably accessible to the worker within the worker's commuting area at any governmental or private training (or education) provider, particularly including on-the-job training with an employer, and it means training that is suitable for the worker and meets the other criteria in paragraph (a) of this section. It also means that emphasis must be given to finding accessible training for the worker, although not precluding training outside the commuting area if none is available at the time within the worker's commuting area. Whether the training is within or outside the commuting area, the training must be available at a reasonable cost as prescribed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.

(ii) In determining whether or not training is reasonably available, first consideration shall be given to training opportunities available within the worker's normal commuting area. Training at facilities outside the worker's normal commuting area should be approved only if such training is not available in the area or the training to be provided outside the normal commuting area will involve less charges to TAA funds.

(5) *The worker is qualified to undertake and complete such training.* (i) This emphasizes the worker's personal qualifications to undertake and complete approved training. Evaluation of the worker's personal qualifications must include the worker's physical and mental capabilities, educational background, work experience and financial resources, as adequate to undertake and complete the specific training program being considered.

(ii) Evaluation of the worker's financial ability shall include an analysis of the worker's remaining weeks of UI and TRA payments in relation to the duration of the training program. If the worker's UI and TRA payments will be exhausted before the end of the training program, it shall be ascertained whether personal or family resources will be available to the worker to complete the training. It must be noted on the worker's record that financial resources were discussed with the worker before the training was approved.

(iii) When adequate financial resources will not be available to the worker to complete a training program which exceeds the duration of UI and TRA payments, the training shall not be approved and consideration shall be given to other training opportunities available to the worker.

(6) *Such training is suitable for the worker and available at a reasonable cost.* (i) Such training means the training being considered for the worker. Suitable for the worker means that paragraph (a)(5) of this section is met and that the training is appropriate for the worker given the worker's capabilities, background and experience.

(ii) Available at a reasonable cost means that training may not be approved at one provider when, all costs being considered, training substantially similar in quality, content and results can be obtained from another provider at a lower total cost within a similar time frame. It also means that training may not be approved when the costs of the training are unreasonably high in comparison with the average costs of training other workers in similar occupations at other providers. This criterion also requires taking into consideration the funding of training costs from sources other than TAA funds, and the least cost to TAA funding of providing suitable training opportunities to the worker. Greater emphasis will need to be given to these elements in determining the reasonable costs of training, particularly in view of the requirements in § 617.11(a) (2) and (3) that TRA claimants be enrolled in and participate in training.

(iii) For the purpose of determining reasonable costs of training, the following elements shall be considered:

(A) Costs of a training program shall include tuition and related expenses (books, tools, and academic fees), travel or transportation expenses, and subsistence expenses;

(B) In determining whether the costs of a particular training program are reasonable, first consideration must be given to the lowest cost training which is available within the commuting area. When training, substantially similar in quality, content and results, is offered at more than one training provider, the lowest cost training shall be approved; and

(C) Training at facilities outside the worker's normal commuting area that involves transportation or subsistence costs which add substantially to the total costs shall not be approved if other appropriate training is available.

(b) *Allowable amounts for training.* In approving a worker's application for training, the conditions for approval in paragraph (a) of this section must be found to be satisfied, including assurance that the training is suitable for the worker, is at the lowest reasonable cost, and will enable the worker to obtain employment within a reasonable period of time. An application for training shall be denied if it is for training in an occupational area which requires an extraordinarily high skill level and for which the total costs of the training are substantially higher than the costs of other training which is suitable for the worker.

(c) *Previous approval of training under State law.* Training previously approved for a worker under State law or other authority is not training approved under paragraph (a) of this section. Any such training may be approved under paragraph (a) of this section, if all of the requirements and limitations of paragraph (a) of this section and other provisions of Subpart C of this part are met, but such approval shall not be retroactive for any of the purposes of this Part 617, including payment of the costs of the training and payment of TRA to the worker participating in the training. However, in the case of a redetermination or decision reversing a determination denying approval of training, for the purposes of this Part 617 such redetermination or decision shall be given effect retroactive to the issuance of the determination that was reversed by such redetermination or decision; but no costs of training may be paid unless such costs actually were incurred for training in which the individual participated, and no additional TRA may be paid with respect to any week the individual was not actually participating in the training.

(d) *Applications.* Applications for, selection for, approval of, or referral to training shall be filed in accordance with this subpart C and on forms which shall be furnished to individuals by the State agency.

(e) *Determinations.* Selection for, approval of, or referral of an individual to training under this subpart C, or a decision with respect to any specific training or non-selection, non-approval, or non-referral for any reason shall be a determination to which §§ 617.50 and 617.51 apply.

(f) *Length of training and hours of attendance.* The State agency shall determine the appropriateness of the length of training and the hours of attendance as follows:

(1) The training shall be of suitable duration to achieve the desired skill level in the shortest possible time;

(2) *Length of training.* The maximum duration for any approvable training program is 104 weeks (during which training is conducted) and no individual shall be entitled to more than one training program under a single certification.

(3) *Training program.* (i) For purposes of this Part 617, a training program may consist of a single course or group of courses which is designed and approved by the State agency for an individual to meet a specific occupational goal.

(ii) When an approved training program involves more than one course and involves breaks in training (within or between courses, or within or between terms, quarters, semesters and academic years), all such breaks in training are subject to the “14-day break in training” provision in § 617.15(d), for purposes of receiving TRA payments. An individual's approved training program may be amended by the State agency to add a course designed to satisfy unforeseen needs of the individual, such as remedial education or specific occupational skills, as long as the length of the amended training program does not exceed the 104-week training limitation in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

(4) *Full-time training.* Individuals in TAA approved training shall attend training full time, and when other training is combined with OJT attendance at both shall be not less than full-time. The hours in a day and days in a week of attendance in training shall be full-time in accordance with established hours and days of training of the training provider.

(g) *Training of reemployed workers.* Adversely affected workers who obtain new employment which is not suitable employment, as described in § 617.22(a)(1), and have been approved for training may elect to:

(1) Terminate their jobs, or

(2) Continue in full- or part-time employment, to undertake such training, and shall not be subject to ineligibility or disqualification for UI or TRA as a result of such termination or reduction in employment.

(h) *Fees prohibited.* In no case shall an individual be approved for training under this subpart C for which the individual is required to pay a fee or tuition.

(i) *Training outside the United States.* In no case shall an individual be approved for training under this subpart C which is conducted totally or partially at a location outside the United States.
