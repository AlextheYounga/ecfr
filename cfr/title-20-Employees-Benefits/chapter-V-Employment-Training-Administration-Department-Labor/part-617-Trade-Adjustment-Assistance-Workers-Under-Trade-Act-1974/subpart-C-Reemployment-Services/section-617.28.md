##### § 617.28 Transportation payments. #####

(a) *Eligibility.* A trainee under this subpart C shall be afforded supplemental assistance necessary to pay transportation expenses if the training is outside the commuting area, but may not receive such assistance if transportation is arranged for the trainee as part of a group and paid for by the State agency or to the extent the trainee receives a payment of transportation expenses under another Federal law, or to the extent the individual is entitled to be paid or reimbursed for such expenses from any other source.

(b) *Amount.* A transportation allowance shall not exceed the lesser of:

(1) The actual cost for travel by the least expensive means of transportation reasonably available between the trainee's home and the training facility; or

(2) The cost per mile at the prevailing mileage rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations. *See* 41 CFR part 101-7.

(c) *Travel included.* Travel for which a transportation allowance shall be paid includes travel:

(1) At the beginning and end of the training program;

(2) When the trainee fails for good cause, as described in § 617.18(b)(2), to complete the training program; and

(3) For daily commuting, in lieu of subsistence, but not exceeding the amount otherwise payable as subsistence for each day of commuting.

(d) *Applications.* Applications for transportation payments shall be filed in accordance with this subpart C and on forms which shall be furnished to trainees by the State agency. Payments may be made in advance. An adjustment shall be made if the amount of an advance is less or more than the amount to which the trainee is entitled under paragraph (b) of this section. A determination as to an application made under this section shall be subject to §§ 617.50 and 617.51.
