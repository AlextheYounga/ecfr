(e) *Supportive services.* Supportive services shall be provided so individuals can obtain or retain employment or participate in employment and training programs leading to eventual placement in permanent employment. Such services may include work orientation, basic education, communication skills, child care, and any other services necessary to prepare an individual for full employment in accordance with the individual's capabilities and employment opportunities.

(f) *On-the-job training (OJT).* OJT is training, in the public or private sector, and may be provided to an individual who meets the conditions for approval of training, as provided in § 617.22(a), and who has been hired by the employer, while the individual is engaged in productive work which provides knowledge or skills essential to the full and adequate performance of the job.
