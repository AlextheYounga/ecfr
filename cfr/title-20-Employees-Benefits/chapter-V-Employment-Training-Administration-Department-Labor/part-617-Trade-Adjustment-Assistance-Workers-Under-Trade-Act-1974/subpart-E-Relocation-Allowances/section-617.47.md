(a) *Computation.* The amount of a moving allowance payable under ยง 617.45(a)(2) shall be 90 percent of the total of the allowable costs under either (1), (2), or (3) of this paragraph, and 90 percent of the total allowable costs under (4) of this paragraph:

(1) *Commercial carrier.* Allowable costs for moving household goods and personal effects of an individual and family, if any, shall not exceed the maximum number of pounds net weight authorized under the Federal travel regulations (*see* 41 CFR part 101-7) by commercial carrier from the individual's old residence to the individual's new residence in the area of relocation, including reasonable and necessary accessorial charges, by the most economical commercial carrier the individual reasonably can be expected to use. Before undertaking such move, the individual must submit to the State agency an estimate from a commercial carrier as to the cost thereof. Accessorial charges shall include the cost of insuring such goods and effects for their actual value or $10,000, whichever is least, against loss or damage in transit, if a bid from a licensed insurer is obtained by the individual and approved by the State agency before departure. If a State agency finds it is more economical to pay a carrier an extra charge to assume the responsibility of a common carrier for such goods and effects, 90 percent of such extra charge, but not exceeding $50, shall be paid in lieu of the cost of insurance.

(2) *Trailer or rental truck* - (i) *Trailer.* If household goods and personal effects are moved by trailer, the allowable costs shall be:

(A) If the trailer is hauled by private vehicle, the cost per mile for the use of the private vehicle at the prevailing mileage rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations (*see* 41 CFR part 101-7) for the usually traveled route from the individual's old residence to the individual's new residence in the area of relocation; and

(B) lf the trailer is rented, and of the type customarily used for moving household goods and personal effects, the rental fee for each day reasonably required to complete the move; or

(C) The actual charge if hauling is by commercial carrier,

(ii) *Rental truck.* If household goods and personal effects are moved by rental truck of the type customarily used for moving household goods and personal effects, the allowable costs shall be:

(A) The rental fee for each day reasonably required to complete the move; and

(B) The necessary fuel for such rental truck paid by the individual.

(3) *House trailer.* If a house trailer or mobile home was used as the individual's place of residence in the old area and will be so used in the new area, the allowable costs of moving such house trailer or mobile home shall be:

(i) The commercial carrier's charges for moving the house trailer or mobile home;

(ii) Charges for unblocking and reblocking;

(iii) Ferry charges, bridge, road, and tunnel tolls, taxes, fees fixed by a State or local authority for permits to transport the unit in or through its jurisdiction, and retention of necessary flagmen; and

(iv) The cost of insuring the house trailer or mobile home, and the personal effects of the individual and family, against loss or damage in transit, in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(4) *Temporary storage.* If temporary storage of household goods and personal effects is necessary, the cost of such temporary storage for a period not to exceed 60 days.

(b) *Travel.* Payments under this section shall be in addition to payments for travel expenses for the individual and family, if any, under ยง 617.45(a)(1), except that the allowable cost for a private vehicle used to haul a trailer may not be paid under this section if any cost with respect to such private vehicle is payable under any other provisions of this subpart E.
