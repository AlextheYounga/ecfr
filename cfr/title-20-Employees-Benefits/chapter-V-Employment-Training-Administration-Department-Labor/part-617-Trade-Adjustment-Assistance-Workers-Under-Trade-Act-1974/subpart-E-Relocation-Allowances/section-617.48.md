##### § 617.48 Time and method of payment. #####

(a) *Determinations.* A State agency shall promptly make and record determinations necessary to assure an individual's entitlement to a relocation allowance at any time, before or after a certification covering the individual is made. No relocation allowance may be paid or advanced to an individual until the State agency determines that the individual is covered under a certification. A State agency shall make payment as promptly as possible upon determining that the individual is covered under a certification and is otherwise eligible.

(b) *Travel and moving allowances.* Allowances computed under §§ 617.46 and 617.47 shall be paid as follows:

(*3*) On completion of the move the individual shall submit promptly to the State agency a receipted bill itemizing and evidencing payment of the rental charges for the trailer or truck and fuel costs, and shall reimburse the State agency for the amount, if any, by which the advance made for the trailer or truck exceeds 90 percent of the rental charges approved by the State agency.
