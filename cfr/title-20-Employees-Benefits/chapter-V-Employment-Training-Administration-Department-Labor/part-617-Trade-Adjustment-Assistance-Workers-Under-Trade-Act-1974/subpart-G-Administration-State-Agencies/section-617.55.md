##### § 617.55 Overpayments; penalties for fraud. #####

(a) *Determination and repayment.* (1) If a State agency or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any person or individual has received any payment under this part 617 to which the person or individual was not entitled, including a payment referred to in paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section, such person or individual shall be liable to repay such amount to the State agency, and the State agency shall recover any such overpayment in accordance with the provisions of this part 617; except that the State agency may waive the recovery of any such overpayment if the State agency determines, in accordance with the guidelines prescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that:

(i) The payment was made without fault on the part of such person or individual; and

(ii) Requiring such repayment would be contrary to equity and good conscience.

(2)(i)(A) In determining whether fault exists for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the following factors shall be considered:

(*1*) Whether a material statement or representation was made by the person or individual in connection with the application for TAA that resulted in the overpayment, and whether the person or individual knew or should have known that the statement or representation was inaccurate.

(*2*) Whether the person or individual failed or caused another to fail to disclose a material fact, in connection with an application for TAA that resulted in the overpayment, and whether the person or individual knew or should have known that the fact was material.

(*3*) Whether the person or individual knew or could have been expected to know, that the person or individual was not entitled to the TAA payment.

(*4*) Whether, for any other reason, the overpayment resulted directly or indirectly, and partially or totally, from any act or omission of the person or individual or of which the person or individual had knowledge, and which was erroneous or inaccurate or otherwise wrong.

(*5*) Whether there has been a determination of fraud under paragraph (b) of this section or section 243 of the Act.

(B) An affirmative finding on any one of the factors in paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section precludes waiver of overpayment recovery.

(ii)(A) In determining whether equity and good conscience exists for purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the following factors shall be considered:

(*1*) Whether the overpayment was the result of a decision on appeal, whether the State agency had given notice to the person or individual that the case has been appealed and that the person or individual may be required to repay the overpayment in the event of a reversal on appeal, and whether recovery of the overpayment will not cause extraordinary and lasting financial hardship to the person or individual.

(*2*) Whether recovery of the overpayment will not cause extraordinary financial hardship to the person or individual, and there has been no affirmative finding under paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section with respect to such person or individual and such overpayment.

(B) An affirmative finding on either of the foregoing factors in paragraphs (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section precludes waiver of overpayment recovery.

(C)(*1*) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, an extraordinary financial hardship shall exist if recovery of the overpayment would result directly in the person's or individual's loss of or inability to obtain minimal necessities of food, medicine, and shelter for a substantial period of time; and an extraordinary and lasting financial hardship shall be extraordinary as described above and may be expected to endure for the foreseeable future.

(*2*) In applying this test in the case of attempted recovery by repayment, a substantial period of time shall be 30 days, and the foreseeable future shall be at least three months. In applying this test in the case of proposed recoupment from other benefits, a substantial period of time and the foreseeable future shall be the longest potential period of benefit entitlement as seen at the time of the request for a waiver determination. In making these determinations, the State agency shall take into account all potential income of the person or individual and the person's or individual's firm, organization, or family and all cash resources available or potentially available to the person or individual and the person's or individual's firm, organization, or family in the time period being considered.

(*3*) Determinations granting or denying waivers of overpayments shall be made only on request for a waiver determination. Such request shall be made on a form which shall be furnished to the person or individual by the State agency. Notices of determination of overpayments shall include an accurate description of the waiver provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, if the State agency has elected to allow waivers of TAA overpayments.

(*4*) Each State shall have the option to establish a policy as to whether the waiver provisions of this section shall be applied to TAA overpayments. A State's decision on its policy shall not be controlled by whether it waives UI overpayments, but the State's decision shall be published for the information of the public and the Department.

(*5*)(i) Unless an overpayment is otherwise recovered, or is waived under paragraph (a) of this section, the State agency shall recover the overpayment by deduction from any sums payable to such person or individual under:

(A) This part 617;

(B) Any Federal unemployment compensation law administered by the State agency; or

(C) Any other Federal law administered by the State agency which provides for the payment of unemployment assistance or an allowance with respect to unemployment.

(ii) In addition, a State agency may recover the overpayment from unemployment insurance payable to such person or individual under the State law.

(b) *Fraud.* If a State agency or a court of competent jurisdiction finds that any person or individual:

(1) Knowingly has made, or caused another to make, a false statement or representation of a material fact; or

(2) Knowingly has failed, or caused another to fail, to disclose a material fact; and as a result of such false statement or representation, or of such nondisclosure, such individual has received any payment under this part 617 to which the person or individual was not entitled, such person or individual shall, in addition to any other penalty provided by law, be ineligible for any further payments under this part 617.

(c) *Training, job search and relocation allowances.* (1) If an individual fails, with good cause, to complete training, a job search, or a relocation, any payment or portion of a payment made under this part 617 to such individual or any person that is not properly and necessarily expended in attempting to complete such training, job search, or relocation, shall constitute an overpayment.

(2) If an individual fails, without good cause, to complete training, a job search, or a relocation, any payment made under this part 617 to such individual or any person shall constitute an overpayment.

(3) Such overpayment shall be recovered or waived as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) *Final determination.* Except for overpayments determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, no repayment may be required, and no deduction may be made, under this section until a determination under paragraph (a) of this section by the State agency has been made, notice of the determination and an opportunity for a fair hearing thereon has been given to the person or individual concerned, and the determination has become final.

(e) *Deposit.* Any amount recovered by a State agency under this section shall be deposited into the Federal fund or account from which payment was made.

(f) *Procedural requirements.* (1) The provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), and (g) of § 617.50 shall apply to determinations and redeterminations made pursuant to this section.

(2) The provisions of § 617.51 shall apply to determinations and redeterminations made pursuant to this section.

(g) *Fraud detection and prevention.* State procedures for the detection and prevention of fraudulent overpayments of TAA shall be, as a minimum, commensurate with the procedures adopted by the State with respect to State unemployment compensation and consistent with the Secretary's “Standard for Fraud and Overpayment Detection,” Employment Security Manual, Part V, sections 7510-7515 (Appendix C of this part).

(h) *Debts due the United States or Others.* (1) Notwithstanding any provision of this part 617, TAA payable to a person or an individual under this part 617 shall be applied by the State agency for the recovery by offset of any debt due the United States from the person or individual.

(2) TAA shall not be applied or used by the State agency in any manner for the payment of any debt of any person or individual to any State or any other entity or person, except that TRA payable to an individual shall be payable to someone other than the individual if required by State law and Federal law to satisfy the individual's obligation for child support or alimony.

(i) *Definition of person.* For purposes of this section, a person includes any employer or other entity or organization as well as the officers and officials thereof who may bear individual responsibility.
