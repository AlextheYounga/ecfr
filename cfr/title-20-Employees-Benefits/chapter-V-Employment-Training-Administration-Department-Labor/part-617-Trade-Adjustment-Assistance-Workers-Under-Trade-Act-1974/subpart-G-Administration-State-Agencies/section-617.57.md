(b) *Disclosure of information.* Information in records maintained by a State agency in administering the Act shall be kept confidential, and information in such records may be disclosed only in the same manner and to the same extent as information with respect to UI and the entitlement of individuals thereto may be disclosed under the applicable State law. Such information shall not, however, be disclosed to an employer or any other person except to the extent necessary to obtain information from the employer or other person for the purposes of this part 617. This provision on the confidentiality of information maintained in the administration of the Act shall not apply, however, to the Department or for the purposes of ยง 617.55 or paragraph (a) of this section, or in the case of information, reports and studies required pursuant to ยง 617.61, or where the result would be inconsistent with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or regulations of the Department promulgated thereunder (*see* 29 CFR parts 70 and 70a).
