##### § 617.14 Maximum amount of TRA. #####

(a) *General rule.* Except as provided under paragraph (b) of this section, the maximum amount of TRA payable to an individual under a certification shall be the amount determined by:

(1) Multiplying by 52 the weekly amount of TRA payable to such individual for a week of total unemployment, as determined under § 617.13(a); and

(2) Subtracting from the product derived under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the total sum of UI to which the individual was entitled (or would have been entitled if the individual had applied therefor) in the individual's first benefit period described in § 617.11(a)(1)(iv) or, as appropriate, § 617.11(a)(2)(iv). The individual's full entitlement shall be subtracted under this paragraph, without regard to the amount, if any, that was actually paid to the individual with respect to such benefit period.

(b) *Exceptions.* The maximum amount of TRA determined under paragraph (a) of this section will not include:

(1) The amount of dependents' allowances paid as a supplement to the base weekly amount determined under § 617.13(a);

(2) The amount of the difference between the individual's weekly increased allowances determined under § 617.13(b) and the individual's weekly amount determined under § 617.13(a); and

(3) The amounts paid for additional weeks determined under § 617.15(b);

but nothing in this paragraph (b) shall affect an individual's eligibility for such supplemental, increased or additional allowances.

(c) *Reduction for Federal training allowance.* (1) If a training allowance referred to in § 617.13(c)(2) is paid to an individual for any week of unemployment with respect to which the individual would be entitled (determined without regard to any disqualification under § 617.18(b)(2)) to TRA, if the individual applied for TRA for such week, each week shall be deducted from the total number of weeks of TRA otherwise payable to the individual.

(2) If the training allowance referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is less than the amount of TRA otherwise payable to the individual for such week, the individual shall, when the individual applies for TRA for such week, be paid TRA in an amount not to exceed the amount equal to the difference between the individual's regular weekly TRA amount, as determined under § 617.13(a), and the amount of the training allowance paid to the individual for such week, as provided in section 232(c) of the Act.
