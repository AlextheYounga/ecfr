(b) *Transition period.* A State not already in compliance with the merit system requirement of paragraph (a) of this section must comply by December 15, 2010.

(c) *Exemptions for States with employment service operation exemptions.* A State whose employment service received an exemption from merit staffing requirements from the Secretary of Labor (Secretary) under the Wagner-Peyser Act will retain an exemption from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
