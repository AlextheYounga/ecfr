(c) SWAs must ensure centralized control procedures are established for the processing of complaints. The manager of the ES office and the SWA Administrator must ensure a central complaint log is maintained, listing all complaints taken by the ES office or the SWA, and specifying for each complaint:

(1) The name of the complainant;

(2) The name of the respondent (employer or State agency);

(3) The date the complaint is filed;

(4) Whether the complaint is by or on behalf of a migrant and seasonal farmworker (MSFW);

(5) Whether the complaint concerns an employment-related law or the ES regulations; and

(6) The action taken and whether the complaint has been resolved.

(d) State agencies must ensure information pertaining to the use of the Complaint System is publicized, which must include, but is not limited to, the prominent display of an Employment and Training Administration (ETA)-approved Complaint System poster in each one-stop center.

(e) Each one-stop center must ensure there is appropriate staff available during regular office hours to take complaints.

(f) Complaints may be accepted in any one-stop center, or by a State Workforce Agency, or elsewhere by an outreach worker.

(g) All complaints filed through the local ES office must be handled by a trained Complaint System representative.

(h) All complaints received by a SWA must be assigned to a State agency official designated by the State Administrator, provided that the State agency official designated to handle MSFW complaints must be the State Monitor Advocate (SMA).

(i) State agencies must ensure any action taken by the Complaint System representative, including referral on a complaint from an MSFW is fully documented containing all relevant information, including a notation of the type of each complaint pursuant to Department guidance, a copy of the original complaint form, a copy of any ES-related reports, any relevant correspondence, a list of actions taken, a record of pertinent telephone calls and all correspondence relating thereto.

When a complaint is submitted or referred to a SWA, the Complaint System representative (where the complainant is an MSFW, the Complaint System representative will be the SMA), must follow-up monthly regarding MSFW complaints, and must inform the complainant of the status of the complaint. No follow-up with the complainant is required for non-MSFW complaints.
