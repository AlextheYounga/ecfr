##### § 645.215 What must a WtW operating entity that serves noncustodial parent participants do? #####

(a) In programs that serve noncustodial parents, the operating entity must give preference to those noncustodial parents who qualify under § 645.212(c)(2)(i) of this subpart over other noncustodial parents. The preference for admission into the program applies only to noncustodial parents and not to any other group eligible under the “general eligibility” provisions of § 645.212(a) or (b) or the “other eligibles” provisions of § 645.213. The preference does not require that the category of noncustodial parents eligible under § 645.212(c)(2)(i) must be exhausted before any other category of eligible noncustodial parents may be served. The operating entity may establish a process that gives preference to noncustodial parents eligible under § 645.212(c)(2)(i) and that also provides WtW services to noncustodial parents eligible under the other provisions of § 645.212(c)(2).

(b) In order to protect custodial parents and children who may be at risk of domestic violence, the operating entity must consult with domestic violence prevention and intervention organizations in the development of its WtW project serving noncustodial parents; and must not require the cooperation of the custodial parent as a condition of participation in the WtW program for either parent; and

(c) The operating entity must ensure that personal responsibility contracts:

(1) Take into account the employment and child support status of the noncustodial parent;

(2) Include all of the following parties:

(i) The noncustodial parent,

(ii) The operating entity, and

(iii) The agency responsible for administering the State Child Support Enforcement program as described under Title IV-D of the Act, unless the operating entity demonstrates to the Secretary of Labor with written documentation that it is not able to coordinate with the State IV-D agency;

(3) Include the following elements:

(i) A commitment by the noncustodial parent to cooperate:

(A) In the establishment of paternity (if the participant is male) of the minor child at the earliest opportunity, through voluntary acknowledgment or other procedures, and

(B) In the establishment of a child support order;

(ii) A commitment by the noncustodial parent to cooperate in the payment of child support for the minor child. This commitment may include a modification of an existing support order to take into account:

(A) The ability of the noncustodial parent to pay such support; and

(B) The participation of the noncustodial parent in the WtW program, and

(iii) A commitment by the noncustodial parent to participate in employment or related activities that will enable the noncustodial parent to make regular child support payments. For noncustodial parents who have not reached 20 years of age, such activities may include:

(A) Completion of high school,

(B) Earning a general equivalency degree, or

(C) Participating in other education directly related to employment;

(iv) A description of the services to be provided to the noncustodial parent under the WtW program;

(4) Contain a commitment by the noncustodial parent to participate in the services that are described in the personal responsibility contract under paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section; and

(5) Be entered into no later than thirty (30) days after the individual is enrolled in and is receiving services through a WtW project funded under this part, unless the operating entity has determined that good cause exists to extend this period. This extension may not extend to a date more than ninety (90) days after the individual is enrolled in and receiving services through a WtW project funded under this part.
