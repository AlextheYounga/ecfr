(b) *What to file.* An employer must file a completed *H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification* (Form ETA-9142A), *Agricultural and Food Processing Clearance Order* (Form ETA-790), and an attachment identifying, with as much geographic specificity as possible for each farmer/rancher, the names, physical locations and estimated start and end dates of need where work will be performed under the job order.

(1) The *H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification* and Form ETA-790 may be filed by an individual employer, association, or an H-2ALC, covering multiple areas of intended employment and more than two contiguous States.

(2) An association of agricultural employers filing as a joint employer may submit a single Form ETA-790 and master *H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification* on behalf of its employer-members located in more than two contiguous States with different start dates of need. Unless modifications to a sheep or goat herding or production of livestock job order are required by the CO or requested by the employer, pursuant to § 655.121(e), the association is not required to re-submit the Form ETA-790 during the calendar year with its H-2A Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
