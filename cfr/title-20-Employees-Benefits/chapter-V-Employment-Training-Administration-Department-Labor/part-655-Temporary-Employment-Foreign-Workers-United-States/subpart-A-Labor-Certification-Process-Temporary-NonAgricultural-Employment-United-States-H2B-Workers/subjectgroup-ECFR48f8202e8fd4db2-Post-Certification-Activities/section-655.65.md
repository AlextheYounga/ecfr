(i) Not later than the next business day after submitting the I-129 petition for H-2B worker(s), the employer must place a new job order for the job opportunity with the State Workforce Agency (SWA), serving the area of intended employment. The employer must follow all applicable SWA instructions for posting job orders, inform the SWA that the job order is being placed in connection with a previously certified *Application for Temporary Employment Certification* for H-2B workers by providing the unique temporary labor certification (TLC) identification number, and receive applications in all forms allowed by the SWA, including online applications (sometimes known as “self-referrals”).

(iii) Where the occupation or industry is traditionally or customarily unionized, during the period of time the SWA is actively circulating the job order described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section for intrastate clearance, the employer must contact (by mail, email or other effective means) the nearest American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations office covering the area of intended employment and provide written notice of the job opportunity, by providing a copy of the job order placed pursuant to (a)(5)(i) of this section, and request assistance in recruiting qualified U.S. workers for the job;

The contact and disclosures required by this paragraph (a)(5)(iv) must be provided in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable;

(v) During the period of time the SWA is actively circulating the job order described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section for intrastate clearance, the employer must engage in the recruitment of U.S. workers as provided in § 655.45(a) and (b). The contact and disclosures required by this paragraph (a)(5)(v) must be provided in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable; and

(vi) The employer must hire any qualified U.S. worker who applies or is referred for the job opportunity until the date on which the last H-2B worker departs for the place of employment, or 30 days after the last date on which the SWA job order is posted, whichever is later. Consistent with § 655.40(a), applicants can be rejected only for lawful job-related reasons.

(6) The employer must attest on Form ETA-9142-B-CAA-6 that it will fully cooperate with any audit, investigation, compliance review, evaluation, verification, or inspection conducted by DOL, including an on-site inspection of the employer's facilities, interview of the employer's employees and any other individuals possessing pertinent information, and review of the employer's records related to the compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to evidence pertaining to or supporting the eligibility criteria for the FY 2022 supplemental allocations outlined in this paragraph (a) and § 655.66(a), as a condition for the approval of the H-2B petition. Pursuant to this subpart and 29 CFR 503.25, the employer will not impede, interfere, or refuse to cooperate with an employee of the Secretary who is exercising or attempting to exercise DOL's audit or investigative authority.
