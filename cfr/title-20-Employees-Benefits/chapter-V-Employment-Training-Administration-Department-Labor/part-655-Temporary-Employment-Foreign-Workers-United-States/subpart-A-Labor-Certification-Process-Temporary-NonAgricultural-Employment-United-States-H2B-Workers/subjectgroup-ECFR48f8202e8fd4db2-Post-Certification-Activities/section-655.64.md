An employer filing a petition with USCIS under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(x) to employ H-2B workers from May 8, 2019 through September 16, 2019, must meet the following requirements:

(a) The employer must attest on Form ETA-9142-B-CAA-3 that without the ability to employ all of the H-2B workers requested on the petition filed pursuant to 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(x), its business is likely to suffer irreparable harm (that is, permanent and severe financial loss), and that the employer will provide documentary evidence of this fact to DHS or DOL upon request.

(b) The employer must attest on Form ETA-9142-B-CAA-3 that each of the workers requested and/or instructed to apply for a visa, on a petition filed pursuant to 8 CFR 214.2(h)(6)(x), have been issued an H-2B visa or otherwise granted H-2B status during one of the last three (3) fiscal years (Fiscal Years 2016, 2017, or 2018).

(c) An employer that files Form ETA-9142B-CAA-3 and the I-129 petition 45 or more days after the certified start date of work, as shown on its approved *Application for Temporary Employment,* must conduct additional recruitment of U.S. workers as follows:

(1) The employer must place a new job order for the job opportunity with the State Workforce Agency, serving the area of intended employment. The employer must follow all applicable State Workforce Agency instructions for posting job orders and receive applications in all forms allowed by the State Workforce Agency, including online applications (sometimes known as “self-referrals”). The job order must contain the job assurances and contents set forth in § 655.18 for recruitment of U.S. workers at the place of employment, and remain posted for at least 5 days beginning not later than the next business day after submitting a petition for H-2B worker(s); and

(2) The employer must place one newspaper advertisement using an online or print format on any day of the week meeting the advertising requirements of § 655.41, during the period of time the State Workforce Agency is actively circulating the job order for intrastate clearance; and

(3) The employer must hire any qualified U.S. worker who applies or is referred for the job opportunity until 2 business days after the last date on which the job order is posted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Consistent with § 655.40(a), applicants can be rejected only for lawful job-related reasons.

(d) This section expires on October 1, 2019.

(e) The requirement to file an attestation under paragraph (a) of this section is intended to be non-severable from the remainder of this section; in the event that paragraph (a) is enjoined or held to be invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section is also intended to be enjoined or held to be invalid in such jurisdiction, without prejudice to workers already present in the United States under this part, as consistent with law.
