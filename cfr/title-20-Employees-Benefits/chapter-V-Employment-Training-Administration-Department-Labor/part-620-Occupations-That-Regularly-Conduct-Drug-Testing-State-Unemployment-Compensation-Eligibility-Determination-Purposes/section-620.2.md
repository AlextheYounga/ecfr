##### § 620.2 Definitions. #####

As used in this part -

*Applicant* means an individual who files an initial claim for unemployment compensation under State law. *Applicant* excludes an individual already found initially eligible and filing a continued claim.

*Controlled substance* means a drug or other substance, or immediate precursor, included in schedule I, II, III, IV, or V of part B of 21 U.S.C. 801 *et seq.,* as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (Pub. L. 91-513, 21 U.S.C. 801 *et seq.*). The term does not include distilled spirits, wine, malt beverages, or tobacco, as those terms are defined or used in subtitle E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

*Occupation* means a position or class of positions. Federal and State laws governing drug testing refer to the classes of positions that are required to be drug tested rather than occupations, such as those defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Standard Occupational Classification System. Therefore, for purposes of this regulation, a position or class of positions will be considered the same as an “occupation.”

*Suitable work* means suitable work as defined by the unemployment compensation law of a State against which the claim is filed. It must be the same definition the State law otherwise uses for determining the type of work an individual must seek given the individual's education, experience and previous level of remuneration.

*Unemployment compensation* means any cash benefits payable to an individual with respect to their unemployment under the State law (including amounts payable under an agreement under a Federal unemployment compensation law.)
