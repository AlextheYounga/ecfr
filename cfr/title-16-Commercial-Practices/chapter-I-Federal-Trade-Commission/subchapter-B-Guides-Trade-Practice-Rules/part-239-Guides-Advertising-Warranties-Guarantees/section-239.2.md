##### § 239.2 Disclosures in warranty or guarantee advertising. #####

(a) If an advertisement mentions a warranty or guarantee that is offered on the advertised product, the advertisement should disclose, with such clarity and prominence as will be noticed and understood by prospective purchasers, that prior to sale, at the place where the product is sold, prospective purchasers can see the written warranty or guarantee for complete details of the warranty coverage.1

1 In television advertising, the Commission will regard any disclosure of the pre-sale availability of warranties as complying with this Guide if the advertisement makes the necessary disclosure simultaneously with or immediately following the warranty claim and the disclosure is made in the audio portion, or, if in the video portion, it remains on the screen for at least five seconds.

Examples:The following are examples of disclosures sufficient to convey to prospective purchasers that, prior to sale, at the place where the product is sold, they can see the written warranty or guarantee for complete details of the warranty coverage. These examples are for both print and broadcast advertising. These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. In each example, the portion of the advertisement that mentions the warranty or guarantee is in regular type and the disclosure is in italics.

A. “The XYZ washing machine is backed by our limited 1 year warranty. *For complete details, see our warranty at a dealer near you.”*

B. “The XYZ bicycle is warranted for 5 years. *Some restrictions may apply. See a copy of our warranty wherever XYZ products are sold.”*

C. “We offer the best guarantee in the business. *Read the details and compare wherever our fine products are sold.”*

D. *“See our full 2 year warranty at the store nearest you.”*

E. “Don't take our word—take our warranty. *See our limited 2 year warranty where you shop.”*

(b) If an advertisement in any catalogue, or in any other solicitation2 for mail order sales or for telephone order sales mentions a warranty or guarantee that is offered on the advertised product, the advertisement should disclose, with such clarity and prominence as will be noticed and understood by prospective purchasers, that prospective purchasers can obtain complete details of the written warranty or guarantee free from the seller upon specific written request or from the catalogue or other solicitation (whichever is applicable).

2 See note 1.

Examples:The following are examples of disclosures sufficient to convey to consumers how they can obtain complete details of the written warranty or guarantee prior to placing a mail or telephone order. These examples are illustrative, not exhaustive. In each example, the portion of the advertisement that mentions the warranty or guarantee is in regular typeface and the disclosure is in italics.

A. “ABC quality cutlery is backed by our 10 year warranty. *Write to us for a free copy at: (address).”*
