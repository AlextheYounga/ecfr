##### ยง 18.4 Size and grade designations. #####

(a) In the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of industry products, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for an industry member to use any term, designation, number, letter, mark, or symbol as a size or grade designation for any industry product in a manner or under any circumstance that misrepresents directly or by implication to purchasers or prospective purchasers the actual size or grade of such products.

(b) Under this section industry members offering lining-out stock for sale shall specify conspicuously and accurately the size and age of such stock when failure to do so may misrepresent directly or by implication such stock to purchasers or prospective purchasers.

(c) Nothing in this section is to be construed as inhibiting the designation of the size or grade of an industry product by use of a size or grade designation for which a standard has been established which is generally recognized in the industry when the identity of such standard is conjunctively disclosed, the product qualifies for the designation under such standard, and no deception of purchasers or prospective purchasers results in the use of such designation.

Note:

It is the consensus of the industry that the grade and size standard set forth in the current edition of American Standard for Nursery Stock, ANSI Z60.1, as approved by the American National Standard Institute, Inc., is generally recognized in the industry, and that use of the size and grade designation therein set forth, in accordance with the requirements of the standard for the designations, in the marketing of industry products to which such standard relates, will prevent deception and confusion of purchasers and prospective purchasers of such products.
