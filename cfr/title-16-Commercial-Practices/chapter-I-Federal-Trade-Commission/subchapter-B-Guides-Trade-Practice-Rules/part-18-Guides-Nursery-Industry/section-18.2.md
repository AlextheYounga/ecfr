##### ยง 18.2 Deception through use of names. #####

(a) In the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of an industry product, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any industry member to use a name for such product that misrepresents directly or by implication to purchasers or prospective purchasers its true identity.

(b) Subject to the foregoing:

(1) When an industry product has a generally recognized and well-established common name, it is proper to use such name as a designation therefor, either alone or in conjunction with the correct botanical name of the product.

(2) When an industry product has a generally recognized and well-established common name, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for an industry member to adopt and use a new name for the product unless such new name is immediately accompanied by the generally recognized and well-established common name, or by the correct botanical name, or by a description of the nature and properties of the product which is of sufficient detail to prevent confusion and deception of purchasers or prospective purchasers as to the true identity of the product.

(3) When an industry product does not have a generally recognized and well-established common name, and a name other than the correct botanical name of the product is applied thereto, such other name shall be immediately accompanied by either the correct botanical name of the product, or a description of the nature and properties of the product which is of sufficient detail as to prevent confusion and deception of purchasers and prospective purchasers as to the true identity of the product.
