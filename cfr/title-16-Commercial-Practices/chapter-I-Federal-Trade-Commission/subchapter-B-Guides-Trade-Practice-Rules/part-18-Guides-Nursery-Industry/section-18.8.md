##### § 18.8 Deception as to origin or source of industry products. #####

(a) It is an unfair or deceptive act or practice to sell, offer for sale, or advertise an industry product by misrepresenting directly or by implication the origin or source of such product to purchasers or prospective purchasers (e.g., by use of the term *Holland* to describe bulbs grown in the U.S.A.); *provided, however,* that when a plant has an accepted common name that incorporates a geographical term and such term has lost its geographical significance as so used, the mere use of such common names does not constitute a misrepresentation as to source or origin (e.g., “Colorado Blue Spruce,” “Arizona Cypress,” “Black Hills Spruce,” “California Privet,” “Japanese Barberry,” etc.).

(b) It is also an unfair or deceptive act or practice to advertise, sell, or offer for sale an industry product of foreign origin without adequate and non-deceptive disclosure of the name of the foreign country from which it came, where the failure to make such disclosure would be misleading to purchasers or prospective purchasers.
