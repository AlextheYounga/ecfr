##### § 18.7 Misrepresentation as to character of business. #####

(a) In the sale, offering for sale, or distribution of industry products, it is an unfair or deceptive act or practice for any industry member to represent itself directly or by implication to be a grower or propagator of such products, or any portion thereof, or to have any other experience or qualification either relating to the growing or propagation of such products or enabling the industry member to be of assistance to purchasers or prospective purchasers in the selection by them of the kinds or types of products, or the placement thereof, when such is not the fact, or in any other manner to misrepresent directly or by implication the character, nature, or extent of the industry member's business.

Note:

Among practices subject to the inhibitions of this section is a representation by an industry member to the effect that he is a landscape architect when his training, experience, and knowledge do not qualify him for such representation.

(b) It is also an unfair or deceptive act or practice for an industry member to use the word “guild,” “club,” “association,” “council,” “society,” “foundation,” or any other word of similar import or meaning, as part of a trade name, or otherwise, in such a manner or under such circumstances as to indicate or imply that its business is other than a commercial enterprise operated for profit, unless such be true in fact, or so as to deceive purchasers or prospective purchasers in any other material respect.
