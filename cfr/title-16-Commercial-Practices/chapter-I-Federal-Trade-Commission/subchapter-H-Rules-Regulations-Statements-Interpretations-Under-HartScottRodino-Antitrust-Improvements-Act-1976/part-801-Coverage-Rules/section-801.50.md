##### § 801.50 Formation of unincorporated entities. #####

(a) In the formation of an unincorporated entity (other than in connection with a consolidation), even though the persons contributing to the formation of the unincorporated entity and the unincorporated entity itself may, in the formation transaction, be both acquiring and acquired persons within the meaning of § 801.2, the contributors shall be deemed acquiring persons only and the unincorporated entity shall be deemed the acquired person only.

(b) Unless exempted by the Act or any of these rules, upon the formation of an unincorporated entity, in a transaction meeting the criteria of Section 7A(a)(1) and 7A(a)(2)(A) (other than in connection with a consolidation), a person is subject to the requirements of the Act if it acquires control of the newly-formed entity. Unless exempted by the Act or any of these rules, upon the formation of an unincorporated entity, in a transaction meeting the criteria of Section 7A(a)(1), the criteria of Section 7A(a)(2)(B)(i) (other than in connection with a consolidation), a person is subject to the requirements of the Act if:

(1)(i) The acquiring person has annual net sales or total assets of $100 million (as adjusted) or more;

(ii) The newly-formed entity has total assets of $10 million (as adjusted) or more; and

(iii) The acquiring person acquires control of the newly-formed entity; or

(2)(i) The acquiring person has annual net sales or total assets of $10 million (as adjusted) or more;

(ii) The newly-formed entity has total assets of $100 million (as adjusted) or more; and

(iii) The acquiring person acquires control of the newly-formed entity.

(c) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the total assets of the newly-formed entity is determined in accordance with § 801.40(d).

(d) Any person acquiring control of the newly-formed entity determines the value of its acquisition in accordance with § 801.10(d).

(e) The commerce criterion of Section 7A(a)(1) is satisfied if either the Activities of any acquiring person are in or affect commerce, or the person filing notification should reasonably believe that the Activities of the newly-formed entity will be in or will affect commerce.

Example:A and B form a new partnership (LP) in which each will acquire a 50 percent interest. A contributes a plant valued at $250 million and $100 million in cash. B contributes $350 million in cash. Because each is acquiring non-corporate interests, valued in excess of $50 million (as adjusted) which confer control of LP both A and B are acquiring persons in the formation. Each must now determine if the exemption in § 802.4 is applicable to their acquisitions of non-corporate interests in LP. For A, LP's exempt assets consist of all of the cash contributed by A and B (pursuant to § 801.21) and A's contribution of the plant (pursuant to § 802.30(c)). Because all of the assets of LP are exempt with regard to A, A's acquisition of non-corporate interests in LP is exempt under § 802.4. For B, LP's exempt assets include only the cash contributions by A and B. The plant contributed by A, valued at $250 million is not exempt under § 802.30(c) with regard to B. Because LP has non-exempt assets in excess of $50 million (as adjusted) with regard to B, B's acquisition of non-corporate interests in LP is not exempt under § 802.4. B must now value its acquisition of non-corporate interests pursuant to § 801.10(d) and because the value of the non-corporate interests is the same as B's contribution to the formation ($350 million), the value exceeds $200 million (as adjusted) and B must file notification prior to acquiring non-corporate interests in LP. See additional examples following §§ 802.30(c) and 802.4.[70 FR 11512, Mar. 8, 2005]
