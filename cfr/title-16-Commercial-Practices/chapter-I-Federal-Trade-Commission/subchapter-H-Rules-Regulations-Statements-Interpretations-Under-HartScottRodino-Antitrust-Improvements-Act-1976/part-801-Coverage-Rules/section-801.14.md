##### § 801.14 Aggregate total amount of voting securities and assets. #####

For purposes of Section 7A(a)(2) and § 801.1(h), the aggregate total amount of voting securities and assets shall be the sum of:

(a) The value of all voting securities of the acquired person which the acquiring person would hold as a result of the acquisition, determined in accordance with § 801.13(a); and

(b) The value of all assets of the acquired person which the acquiring person would hold as a result of the acquisition, determined in accordance with § 801.13(b).

Examples:1. Acquiring person “A” previously acquired less than $50 million (as adjusted) of the voting securities (not convertible voting securities) of corporation X. “A” now intends to acquire additional assets of X. Under paragraph (a) of this section, “A” looks to § 801.13(a) and determines that the voting securities are to be held “as a result of” the acquisition. Section 801.13(a) also provides that “A” must determine the present value of the previously acquired securities. Under paragraph (b) of this section, “A” looks to § 801.13(b)(1) and determines that the assets to be acquired will be held “as a result of” the acquisition, and are valued under § 801.10(b). Therefore, if the voting securities have a present value which when combined with the value of the assets would exceed $50 million (as adjusted), the asset acquisition is subject to the requirements of the act since, as a result of it, “A” would hold an aggregate total amount of the voting securities and assets of “X” in excess of $50 million (as adjusted) .

2. In the previous example, assume that the assets acquisition occurred first, and that the acquisition of the voting securities is to occur within 180 days of the first acquisition. “A” now looks to § 801.13(b)(2) and determines that because the second acquisition is of voting securities and not assets, the asset and voting securities acquisitions are not treated as one transaction. Therefore, the second acquisition would not be subject to the requirements of the act since the value of the securities to be acquired does not exceed the $50 million (as adjusted) size-of-transaction test.

(c) The value of all non-corporate interests of the acquired person which the acquiring person would hold as a result of the acquisition, determined in accordance with § 801.13(c).
