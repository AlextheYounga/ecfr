##### § 801.21 Securities and cash not considered assets when acquired. #####

For purposes of determining the aggregate total amount of assets under Section 7A(a)(2)(A), Section 7A(a)(2)(B)(i), Sec. 801.13(b), and Sec. 802.4:

(a) Cash shall not be considered an asset of the person from which it is acquired; and

(b) Neither voting or nonvoting securities nor obligations referred to in section 7A(c)(2) shall be considered assets of another person from which they are acquired.

Examples:1. Assume that acquiring person “A” acquires voting securities of issuer X from “B,” a person unrelated to X. Under this paragraph, the acquisition is treated only as one of voting securities, requiring “A” and “X” to comply with the requirements of the act, rather than one in which “A” acquires the assets of “B,” requiring “A” and “B” to comply. See also example 2 to § 801.30. Note that for purposes of section 7A(a)(2)—that is, for the next regularly prepared balance sheet of “A” referred to in § 801.11—the voting securities of X must be reflected after their acquisition; see § 801.11(c)(2).

2. In the previous example, if “A” acquires nonvoting securities of X from “B,” then under this section the acquisition would be treated only as one of nonvoting securities of X (and would be exempt under section 7A(c)(2)), rather than one in which “A” acquires assets of “B,” requiring “A” and “B” to comply. Again, the nonvoting securities of X would have to be reflected in “A's” next regularly prepared balance sheet for purposes of section 7A(a)(2).

3. In example 1, assume that “B” receives only cash from “A” in exchange for the voting securities of X. Under this section, “B's” acquisition of cash is *not* an acquisition of the “assets” of “A,” and “B” is not required to file notification as an acquiring person.
