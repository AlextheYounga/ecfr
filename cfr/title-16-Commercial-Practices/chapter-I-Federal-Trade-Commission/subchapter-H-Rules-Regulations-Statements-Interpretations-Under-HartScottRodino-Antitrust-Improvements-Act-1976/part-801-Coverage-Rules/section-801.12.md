##### § 801.12 Calculating percentage of voting securities. #####

(a) *Voting securities.* Whenever the act or these rules require calculation of the percentage of voting securities to be held or acquired, the issuer whose voting securities are being acquired shall be deemed the “acquired persons.”

Example:Person “A” is composed of corporation A1 and subsidiary A2; person “B” is composed of corporation B1 and subsidiary B2. Assume that A2 proposes to sell assets to B1 in exchange for common stock of B2. Under this paragraph, for purposes of calculating the percentage of voting securities to be held, the “acquired person” is B2. For all other purposes, the acquired person is “B.” (For all purposes, the “acquiring persons” are “A” and “B.”)

(b) *Percentage of voting securities.* (1) Whenever the act or these rules require calculation of the percentage of voting securities of an issuer to be held or acquired, the percentage shall be the sum of the separate ratios for each class of voting securities, expressed as a percentage. The ratio for each class of voting securities equals:

(i)(A) The number of votes for directors of the issuer which the holder of a class of voting securities is presently entitled to cast, and as a result of the acquisition, will become entitled to cast, divided by,

(B) The total number of votes for directors of the issuer which presently may be cast by that class, and which will be entitled to be cast by that class after the acquisition, multiplied by,

(ii)(A) The number of directors that class is entitled to elect, divided by (B) the total number of directors.

Examples:In each of the following examples company X has two classes of voting securities, class A, consisting of 1000 shares with each share having one vote, and class B, consisting of 100 shares with each share having one vote. The class A shares elect four of the ten directors and the class B shares elect six of the ten directors.

In this situation, § 801.12(b) requires calculations of the percentage of voting securities held to be made according to the following formula:

Number of votes of class A held divided by Total votes of class A times Directors elected by class A stock divided by Total number of directors

PlusNumber of votes of class B held divided by Total votes of class B times Directors elected by class B stock divided by Total number of directors1. Assume that company Y holds all 100 shares of class B stock and no shares of class A stock. By virtue of its class B holdings, Y has all 100 of the votes which may be cast by class B stock and can elect six of company X's ten directors. Applying the formula which results from the rule, Y calculates that it holds 100/100 × 6/10 or 60 percent of the voting securities of company X because of its holdings of class B stock and no additional percentage derived from holdings of class A stock. Consequently, Y holds a total of 60 percent of the voting securities of company X.

2. Assume that company Y holds 500 shares of class A stock and no shares of class B stock. By virtue of its class A holdings, Y has 500 of the 1000 votes which may be cast by class A to elect four of company X's ten directors. Applying the formula, Y calculates that it holds 500/1000 × 4/10 or 20 percent of the voting securities of company X from its holdings of class A stock and no additional percentage derived from holdings of class B stock. Consequently, Y holds a total of 20 percent of the voting securities of company X.

3. Assume that company Y holds 500 shares of class A stock and 60 shares of class B stock. Y calculates that it holds 20 percent of the voting securities of company X because of its holdings of class A stock (see example 2). Additionally, as a result of its class B holdings Y has 60 of the 100 votes which may be cast by class B stock to elect six of company X's ten directors. Applying the formula, Y calculates that it holds 60/100 × 6/10 or 36 percent of the voting securities of company X because of its holdings of class B stock. Since the formula requires that a person that holds different classes of voting securities of the same issuer add together the separate percentages calculated for each class, Y holds a total of 56 percent (20 percent plus 36 percent) of the voting securities of company X.

(2) Authorized but unissued voting securities and treasury voting securities shall not be considered securities presently entitled to vote for directors of the issuer.

(3) For purposes of determining the number of outstanding voting securities of an issuer, a person may rely upon the most recent information set forth in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that the information contained therein is inaccurate.

Examples:1. In the example to paragraph (a), to determine the percentage of B2's voting securities which will be held by “A” after the transaction, all voting securities of B2 held by “A,” the “acquiring person” (including A2 and all other entities included in person “A”), must be aggregated. If “A” holds convertible securities of B2 which meet the definition of voting securities in § 801.1(f), these securities are to be disregarded in calculating the percentage of voting securities held by “A.”

2. Under this formula, any votes obtained by means of proxies from other persons are also disregarded in calculating the percentage of voting securities to be held or acquired.
