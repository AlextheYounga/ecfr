##### § 802.35 Acquisitions by employee trusts. #####

An acquisition of voting securities shall be exempt from the notification requirements of the act if:

(a) The securities are acquired by a trust that meets the qualifications of section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code;

(b) The trust is controlled by a person that employs the beneficiaries and,

(c) The voting securities acquired are those of that person or an entity within that person.

Examples:1. Company A establishes a trust for its employees that meets the qualifications of section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. Company A has the power to designate the trustee of the trust. That trust then acquires 30% of the voting securities of Company A for in excess of $50 million (as adjusted). Later, the trust acquires 20% of the stock of Company B, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company A, for in excess of $50 million (as adjusted). Neither acquisition is reportable.

2. Assume that in the example above, “A” has total assets of $100 million (as adjusted). “C” also has total assets of $100 million (as adjusted) and is not controlled by Company A. The trust controlled by Company A plans to acquire 40 percent of the voting securities of Company C for in excess of $50 million (as adjusted). Since Company C is not included within “A,” “A” must observe the requirements of the act before the trust makes the acquisition of Company C's shares.
