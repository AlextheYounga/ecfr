##### § 1.9 Petitions to commence trade regulation rule proceedings. #####

Trade regulation rule proceedings may be commenced by the Commission upon its own initiative or pursuant to written petition filed with the Secretary by any interested person stating reasonable grounds therefor. If the Commission determines to commence a trade regulation rule proceeding pursuant to the petition, the petitioner will be mailed a copy of the public notices issued under §§ 1.10, 1.11 and 1.12. Any person whose petition is not deemed by the Commission sufficient to warrant commencement of a rulemaking proceeding will be notified of that determination and may be given an opportunity to submit additional data.
