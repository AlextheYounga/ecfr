##### ยง 1.25 Initiation of proceedings - petitions. #####

Proceedings for the issuance of rules or regulations, including proceedings for exemption of products or classes of products from statutory requirements, may be commenced by the Commission upon its own initiative or pursuant to petition filed with the Secretary by any interested person or group stating reasonable grounds therefor. Anyone whose petition is not deemed by the Commission sufficient to warrant the holding of a rulemaking proceeding will be promptly notified of that determination and given an opportunity to submit additional data. Procedures for the amendment or repeal of a rule or regulation are the same as for the issuance thereof.
