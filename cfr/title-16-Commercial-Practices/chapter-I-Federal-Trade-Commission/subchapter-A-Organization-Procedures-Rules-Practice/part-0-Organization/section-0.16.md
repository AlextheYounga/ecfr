##### ยง 0.16 Bureau of Competition. #####

The Bureau is responsible for enforcing Federal antitrust and trade regulation laws under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Clayton Act, and a number of other special statutes that the Commission is charged with enforcing. The Bureau's work aims to preserve the free market system and assure the unfettered operation of the forces of supply and demand. Its activities seek to ensure price competition, quality products and services and efficient operation of the national economy. The Bureau carries out its responsibilities by investigating alleged law violations, and recommending to the Commission such further action as may be appropriate. Such action may include injunctive and other equitable relief in Federal district court, complaint and litigation before the agency's administrative law judges, formal nonadjudicative settlement of complaints, trade regulation rules, or reports. The Bureau also conducts compliance investigations and initiates proceedings for civil penalties to assure compliance with final Commission orders dealing with competition and trade restraint matters. The Bureau's activities also include business and consumer education and staff advice on competition laws and compliance, and liaison functions with respect to foreign antitrust and competition law enforcement agencies and organizations, including requests for international enforcement assistance.
