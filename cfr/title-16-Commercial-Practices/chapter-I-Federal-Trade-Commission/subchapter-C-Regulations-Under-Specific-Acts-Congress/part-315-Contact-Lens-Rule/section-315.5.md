(2) Verified by direct communication.

(b) *Information for verification.* When seeking verification of a contact lens prescription, a seller shall provide the prescriber with the following information through direct communication:

(7) If the seller opts to include the prescriber's regular business hours on Saturdays as “business hours” for purposes of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a clear statement of the prescriber's regular Saturday business hours.

(c) *Verification events.* A prescription is verified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section only if one of the following occurs:

(2) The prescriber informs the seller through direct communication that the prescription is inaccurate and provides the accurate prescription; or

(3) The prescriber fails to communicate with the seller within eight (8) business hours after receiving from the seller the information described in paragraph (b) of this section. During these eight (8) business hours, the seller shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the prescriber to communicate with the seller concerning the verification request.
