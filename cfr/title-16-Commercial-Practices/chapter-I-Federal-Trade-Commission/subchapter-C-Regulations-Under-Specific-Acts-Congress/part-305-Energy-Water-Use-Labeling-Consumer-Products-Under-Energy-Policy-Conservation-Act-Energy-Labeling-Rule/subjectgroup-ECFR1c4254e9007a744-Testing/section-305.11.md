In lieu of submitting the required information to the Commission as required by this section, manufacturers may submit such information to the Department of Energy via the CCMS at *https://regulations.doe.gov/ccms* as provided by 10 CFR 429.12.

(2) Manufacturers of ceiling fans shall submit annually a report containing the brand name, model number, diameter (in inches), wattage excluding any lights, airflow (capacity) for each basic model in current production, and starting serial number, date code or other means of identifying the date of manufacture with the first submission for each basic model. In lieu of submitting the required information to the Commission as required by this section, manufacturers may submit such information to the Department of Energy via the Compliance and Certification Management System (CCMS) at *https://regulations.doe.gov/ccms* as provided by 10 CFR 429.12.

(3) Manufacturers of televisions shall submit annually a report containing the brand name; model number; screen size (diagonal in inches); power (in watts) consumed in on mode, standby-passive mode, in standby-active mode, low mode, and off mode; and annual energy consumption (kWh/year) for each basic model in current production. The report should also include a starting serial number, date code, or other means of identifying the date of manufacture with the first submission for each basic model. In lieu of submitting the required information to the Commission as required by this section, manufacturers may submit such information to the Department of Energy via the Compliance and Certification Management System (CCMS) at *https://regulations.doe.gov/ccms* as provided by 10 CFR 429.12.

Manufacturers may accomplish this by either submitting a specific link to a URL for each label, a link to a PDF download for each label, or a link to a website that takes users directly to a searchable database of the covered labels from which the label image or download may be accessed using the model number as certified to DOE pursuant to 10 CFR part 429 and the model number advertised in product literature. Such label information must be submitted either at the time the model is certified to DOE pursuant to 10 CFR part 429 or at some time on or before the annual report date immediately following such certification. In lieu of submitting the required information to the Commission, manufacturers may submit such information to the Department of Energy via the CCMS at *https://regulations.doe.gov/ccms* as provided by 10 CFR 429.12.
