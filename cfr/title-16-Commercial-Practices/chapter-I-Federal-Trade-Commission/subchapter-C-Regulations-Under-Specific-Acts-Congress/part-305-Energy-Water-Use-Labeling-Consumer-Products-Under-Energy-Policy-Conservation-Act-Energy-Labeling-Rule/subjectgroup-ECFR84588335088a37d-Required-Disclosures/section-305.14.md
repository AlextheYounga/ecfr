##### § 305.14 Energy information disclosures for heating and cooling equipment. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 63650, Sept. 15, 2016.

(a) The following provisions apply to any covered central air conditioner, heat pump, or furnaces distributed in commerce before the compliance date of regional efficiency standards issued by the Department of Energy in 10 CFR part 430 for non-weatherized, and mobile home furnaces.

(1) *Required information.* Manufacturers and private labelers of central air conditioners, heat pumps, and furnaces (including boilers) must provide energy information about the equipment they sell to distributors and retailers, including contractors. This information can be provided through means such as fact sheets, product brochures, and directories. All required information must be disclosed clearly and conspicuously. The information must include:

(i) Name of manufacturer or private labeler which, in the case of a corporation, shall be deemed to be satisfied only by the actual corporate name, which may be preceded or followed by the name of the particular division of the corporation. In the case of an individual, partnership, or association, the name under which the business is conducted shall be used;

(ii) Trade name (if different from manufacturer);

(iii) Model number(s) given by the manufacturer or private labeler;

(iv) Capacity or size as determined in accordance with § 305.7;

(v) Energy efficiency rating as determined in accordance with § 305.5. The energy efficiency rating(s) for split-system condenser-evaporator coil combinations shall be either:

(A) The energy efficiency rating of the actual condenser-evaporator coil combination comprising the listed split system; or

(B) The energy efficiency rating of the condenser-evaporator coil combination that is the particular manufacturer's most commonly sold combination for that condenser model.

(vi) Ranges of comparability and of energy efficiency ratings found in the appropriate appendices accompanying this part.

(vii) A statement that the energy efficiency ratings are based on U.S. Government standard tests.

(viii) If the “most common” condenser-evaporator coil combinations are given for central air conditioners and heat pump efficiency ratings pursuant to § 305.14(a)(1)(v)(B), the statement required by § 305.14(a)(1)(vii) as follows:

(A) For information disclosing the seasonal energy efficiency ratio for cooling, the statement should read:

This energy rating is based on U.S. Government standard tests of this condenser model combined with the most common coil. The rating may vary slightly with different coils.

(B) For information disclosing both the seasonal energy efficiency ratio for cooling and the heating seasonal performance factor for heating, the statement should read:

This energy rating is based on U.S. Government standard tests of this condenser model combined with the most common coil. The rating will vary slightly with different coils and in different geographic regions.

(C) For information disclosing the heating seasonal performance factor for heating, the statement should read:

This energy rating is based on U.S. Government standard tests of this condenser model combined with the most common coil. The rating will vary slightly with different coils and in different geographic regions.

(ix) For central air conditioners disclosing the efficiency ratings for specific condenser/coil combinations pursuant to § 305.14(a)(1)(v)(B), a general disclosure that the efficiency ratings are based on U.S. Government tests.

(2) *Distribution.* (i) Manufacturers and private labelers must give distributors and retailers, including assemblers, the information specified under § 305.14(a)(1) for the central air conditioners, heat pumps, and furnaces (including boilers) they sell to them. This information may be provided in paper or electronic form (including Internet-based access). Distributors must give this information to retailers, including assemblers, they supply.

(ii) Retailers, including assemblers, who sell central air conditioners, heat pumps, and furnaces (including boilers) to consumers must make the information specified under § 305.14(a)(1) available to customers in any manner, as long as customers are likely to notice it. For example, it may be available in a display, where customers can take copies of them. It may be kept in a binder or made available electronically at a counter or service desk, with a sign telling customers where the required information is.

(iii) Retailers, including assemblers, who negotiate or make sales at a place other than their regular places of business must show the required information to their customers and let them read the information before they agree to purchase the product. If the information is Internet-based, retailers, including assemblers, who negotiate or make sales at a place other than their regular places of business, may choose to provide customers with instructions to access such information in lieu of showing them a paper version of the information. Retailers who choose to use the Internet for the required information, must let customers read such information before the customers agree to purchase the product.

(b) The following provisions apply to any covered central air conditioner, heat pump, or furnaces distributed in commerce on or after the compliance date of regional efficiency standards issued by the Department of Energy in 10 CFR part 430 for non-weatherized and mobile home furnaces.

(1) *Manufacturer duty to provide labels.* For any covered central air conditioner, heat pump, or furnace model that a manufacturer distributes in commerce, the manufacturer must make a copy of the EnergyGuide label available on a publicly accessible Web site in a manner that allows catalog sellers and consumers to hyperlink to the label or download it for their use. The labels must remain on the Web site for six months after the manufacturer ceases the model's production.

(2) *Distribution.* (i) Manufacturers and private labelers must provide to distributors and retailers, including assemblers, EnergyGuide labels for covered central air conditioners, heat pumps, and furnaces (including boilers) they sell to them. The label may be provided in paper or electronic form (including Internet-based access). Distributors must give this information to retailers, including assemblers, they supply.

(ii) Retailers, including assemblers, who sell covered central air conditioners, heat pumps, and furnaces (including boilers) to consumers must show the labels for the products they offer to customers and let them read the labels before the customers agree to purchase the product. For example, the retailer may display labeled units in their store or direct consumers to the labels in a binder or computer at a counter or service desk.

(iii) Retailers, including installers and assemblers, who negotiate or make sales at a place other than their regular places of business, including sales over the telephone or through electronic communications, must show the labels for the products they offer to customers and let them read the labels before the customers agree to purchase the product. If the labels are on a Web site, retailers, including assemblers, who negotiate or make sales at a place other than their regular places of business, may choose to provide customers with instructions to access such labels in lieu of showing them a paper version of the information. Retailers who choose to use the Internet for the required label disclosures must provide customers the opportunity to read such information prior to sale of the product.

(3) *Oil furnace labels.* If an installer installs an oil furnace with an input capacity different from that set by the manufacturer and the manufacturer identifies alternative capacities on the label, the installer must permanently mark the appropriate box on the EnergyGuide label displaying the installed input capacity and the associated AFUE as illustrated in Sample Label 9B.
