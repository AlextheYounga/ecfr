(2) Manufacturers of ceiling fans shall submit annually a report containing the brand name, model number, diameter (in inches), wattage excluding any lights, airflow (capacity) for each basic model in current production, and starting serial number, date code or other means of identifying the date of manufacture with the first submission for each basic model. In lieu of submitting the required information to the Commission as required by this section, manufacturers may submit such information to the Department of Energy via the Compliance and Certification Management System (CCMS) at *https://regulations.doe.gov/ccms* as provided by 10 CFR 429.12.

The report should also include a starting serial number, date code, or other means of identifying the date of manufacture with the first submission for each basic model. In lieu of submitting the required information to the Commission as required by this section, manufacturers may submit such information to the Department of Energy via the Compliance and Certification Management System (CCMS) at *https://regulations.doe.gov/ccms* as provided by 10 CFR 429.12.

(5) After September 15, 2017, manufacturers must begin submitting a Web site address for the online EnergyGuide labels covered by § 305.6(a) in new model and annual reports required by this section. Manufacturers may accomplish this by either submitting a specific link to a URL for each label, a link to a PDF download for each label, or a link to a Web site that takes users directly to a searchable database of the covered labels from which the label image or download may be accessed using the model number as certified to DOE pursuant to 10 CFR part 429 and the model number advertised in product literature. Such label information must be submitted either at the time the model is certified to DOE pursuant to 10 CFR part 429 or at some time on or before the annual report date immediately following such certification. In lieu of submitting the required information to the Commission, manufacturers may submit such information to the Department of Energy via the CCMS at *https://regulations.doe.gov/ccms* as provided by 10 CFR 429.12.
