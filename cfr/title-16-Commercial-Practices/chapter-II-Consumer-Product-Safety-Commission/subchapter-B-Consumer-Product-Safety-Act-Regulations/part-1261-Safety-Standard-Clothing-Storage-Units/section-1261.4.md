##### § 1261.4 Requirements for stability. #####

(a) *General.* Clothing storage units shall be configured as described in paragraph (b) of this section, and tested in accordance with the procedure in paragraph (c) of this section. Clothing storage units shall meet the requirement for tip-over stability based on the tip-over moment as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(b) *Test configuration.* The clothing storage unit used for tip-over testing shall be configured in the following manner:

(1) If the unit is not fully assembled, assemble the unit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Units shall not be attached to the wall or any upright structure for testing.

(2) Place the unit on a hard, level, and flat test surface in the orientation most likely to cause tip over. If necessary, secure the unit from sliding without preventing tip over.

(3) If the clothing storage unit has one or more levelling devices, adjust the levelling device(s) to the lowest level; then adjust the levelling device(s) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.

(4) Record the maximum handhold height, the longest extendable element extension from fulcrum distance, and the longest door extension from fulcrum distance, as applicable. These measurements are used in paragraph (d) of this section.

(5) Tilt the clothing storage unit forward by placing the test block(s) under the unit's most rear floor support(s) such that either the entire floor support contact area is over the test block(s) or the back edge of the test block(s) is aligned with the back edge of the rear floor supports.

(6) Disable or bypass any interlock(s) in accordance with § 1261.3(c).

(7) Open all hinged doors that open outward or downward that are not locked by an interlock to the least stable configuration (typically 90 degrees).

(8) Open all extendable elements that are not locked by an interlock to the maximum extension, in the configuration most likely to cause tip over (typically the configuration with the largest drawers in the highest position open). Then place fill weights according to the following criteria:

(i) If 50 percent or more of the extendable elements by functional volume are open, place a fill weight in the center of the bottom surface of each extendable element, including those that remain closed, that consists of a uniformly distributed mass in pounds. The fill weight in open extendable elements must be at least 8.5 pounds/cubic foot times the functional volume (cubic feet). The fill weight in closed extendable elements must be no more than 8.5 pounds/cubic foot times the functional volume (cubic feet). If necessary, secure the fill weights to prevent sliding. See figure 1 to this paragraph (b)(8)(i).

(ii) If less than 50 percent of the extendable elements by functional volume are open, do not place a fill weight in or on any extendable element(s). See figure 2 to this paragraph (b)(8)(ii).

(c) *Test procedure to determine tip-over moment of the unit.* Perform one of the following two tip-over tests (Test Method 1 or Test Method 2), whichever is the most appropriate for the unit:

(1) Test Method 1 shall be used for units with extendable elements that extend at least 6 inches from the fulcrum. Record the horizontal distance from where the center of force will be applied (the center of gravity of the weights to be applied) to the fulcrum. Gradually apply over a period of at least 5 seconds weights to the face of an extended extendable element of the unit to cause the unit to tip over. The weights are to be placed on a single drawer face or distributed evenly across multiple drawer faces or as adjacent as possible to the pull-out shelf face. The weights shall not interfere with other extended extendable elements. Record the tip-over force. Calculate the tip-over moment of the unit by multiplying the tip-over force (pounds) by the horizontal distance from the center of the force application to the fulcrum (feet). See figure 3 to this paragraph (c)(1).

(2) Test Method 2 shall be used for any unit for which Test Method 1 does not apply. Record the vertical distance from where the center of force will be applied to the fulcrum. Gradually apply over a period of at least 5 seconds a horizontal force to the unit orthogonal to the fulcrum to cause the unit to tip over. Record the tip-over force. Calculate the tip-over moment of the unit by multiplying the tip-over force (pounds) by the vertical distance from the center of force application to the fulcrum (feet). See figure 4 to this paragraph (c)(2).

(3) If a failed component prohibits completion of the test, then to continue testing, the failed component(s) must be repaired or replaced to the original specifications, or the component(s) must be replaced and the test repeated with the failed component(s) secured to prevent the component(s) from failing, as long as the modifications do not increase the tip-over moment.

(d) *Performance requirement.* The tip-over moment of the clothing storage unit must be greater than the threshold moment, which is the greatest of all of the applicable moments in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section:

(1) For units with an extendable element(s): 55.3 pounds times the extendable element extension from fulcrum distance in feet +26.6 pound-feet;

(2) For units with a door(s): 51.2 pounds times the door extension from fulcrum distance in feet −12.8 pound-feet; and

(3) For all units: 17.2 pounds times maximum handhold height in feet.
