##### § 1261.6 Requirements to provide performance and technical data by labeling. #####

Manufacturers of clothing storage units shall give notification of performance and technical data related to performance and safety to prospective purchasers of such products at the time of original purchase and to the first purchaser of such product for purposes other than resale, in the manner set forth in this section:

(a) *Consumer information requirements for physical points of sale, packaging, and on-product.* The manufacturer shall provide a hang tag with every clothing storage unit that provides the ratio of tip-over moment as tested to the minimally allowed tip-over moment of that model clothing storage unit. The label must conform in content, form, and sequence to the hang tag shown in figure 2 to this paragraph (a).

(1) *Size.* Every hang tag shall be at least 5 inches wide by 7 inches tall.

(2) *Side 1 content.* The front of every hang tag shall contain the following:

(i) The title—“TIP OVER GUIDE.”

(ii) The icon shown in figure 1 to this paragraph (a)(2)(ii):

Figure 1 to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)—Hang tag icon.![](/graphics/er25no22.026.gif)

(iii) The statement—“Stability Rating.”

(iv) The manufacturer's name and model number of the unit.

(v) Ratio of tip-over moment, as tested per § 1261.4(c), to the threshold moment, as determined per § 1261.4(d), of that model clothing storage unit, displayed on a progressive scale. This value shall be the stability rating, rounded to one decimal place (*e.g.,* X.Y).

(vi) The scale shall start at 1 and end at 2.

(vii) “MIN” and “OR MORE” on the left and right sides of the scale, respectively.

(viii) A solid horizontal line from 1 to the calculated rating.

(ix) The statement—“This unit is [enter rating value] times more stable than the minimum required,” with the stability rating to be inserted for bracketed text.

(x) The statement—“Compare with other units before you buy.”

(xi) The statement—“This is a guide to compare units' resistance to tipping over.”

(xii) The statement—“Higher numbers represent more stable units.”

(xiii) The statement—“No unit is completely safe from tip over.”

(xiv) The statement—“Always secure the unit to the wall.”

(xv) The statement—“Tell children not to climb furniture.”

(xvi) The statement—“See back side of this tag for more information.”

(xvii) The statement—“THIS TAG NOT TO BE REMOVED EXCEPT BY THE CONSUMER.”

(3) *Side 2 content.* The reverse of every hang tag shall contain the following:

(i) The statement—“Stability Rating Explanation.”

(ii) The icon in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

(iii) The stability rating determined in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section.

(iv) The statement—“Test data on this unit indicated it withstood [insert rating determined in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section] times the minimally acceptable moment, per tests required by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (see below),” with the stability rating to be inserted for bracketed text.

(v) The statement—“Deaths and serious crushing injuries have occurred from furniture tipping over onto people.”

(vi) The statement—“To reduce tip-over incidents, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) requires that clothing storage units, such as dressers, chests, bureaus, and armoires, resist certain tip-over forces. The test that CPSC requires measures the stability of a clothing storage unit and its resistance to rotational forces, also known as moments. This test is based on threshold rotational forces of a 3-year-old child climbing up, hanging on, or pulling on drawers and/or doors of this unit. These actions create rotational forces (moments) that can cause the unit to tip forward and fall over. The stability rating on this tag is the ratio of this unit's tip-over moment (using CPSC's test) and the threshold tip-over moment. More information on the test method can be found in 16 CFR part 1261.”

(4) *Format.* The hang tag shall be formatted as shown in figure 2 to this paragraph (a). The background of the front of the tag shall be printed in full bleed process yellow or equivalent; the background of the back of the tag shall be white. All type and graphics shall be printed in process black.

(5) *Attachment.* Every hang tag shall be attached to the clothing storage unit and be clearly visible to a person standing in front of the unit. The hang tag shall be attached to the clothing storage unit and lost or damaged hang tags must be replaced such that they are attached and provided, as required by this section, at the time of original purchase to prospective purchasers and to the first purchaser other than resale. The hang tags may be removed only by the first purchaser.

(6) *Placement.* The hang tag shall appear on the product and the immediate container of the product in which the product is normally offered for sale at retail. Ready-to-assemble furniture shall display the hang tag on the main panel of consumer-level packaging. The hang tag shall remain on the product/container/packaging until the time of original purchase. Any units shipped directly to consumers shall contain the hang tag on the immediate container of the product.

(b) *Consumer information requirements for online points of sale.* Any manufacturer or importer of a clothing storage unit with an online sales interface (*e.g.,* website or app) from which the clothing storage unit may be purchased shall provide on the online sales interface that offers the clothing storage unit for purchase:

(1) All of the content required by paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, in the form and sequence shown in figure 2 to paragraph (a) of this section, except that it need not contain the statements in paragraphs (a)(2)(xvi) and (xvii) of this section.

(2) The stability rating must be displayed in a font size equivalent to that of the price, in proximity to the price of the product, and a link to the virtual hang tag of the product must be provided through one user action (*e.g.,* mouse click, mouse roll-over, or tactile screen expansion) on the stability rating value or image.
