##### § 1211.12 Requirements for edge sensors. #####

(a) *Normal operation test.* (1) When installed on a representative residential door edge, an edge sensor shall actuate upon the application of a 15 pounds (66.7 N) or less force in the direction of the application. For an edge sensor intended to be used on a sectional door, the force is to be applied by the longitudinal edge of a 17/8 inch (47.6 mm) diameter cylinder placed across the switch so that the axis is perpendicular to the plane of the door. For an edge sensor intended to be used on a one piece door, the force is to be applied so that the axis is at an angle 30 degrees from the direction perpendicular to the plane of the door. See figure 6 to subpart A.

(2) With respect to the test of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the test is to be repeated at various representative points of the edge sensor across the width of the door.

(3) Exception: The edge sensor need not be sensitive to actuation two inches (50.4 mm) or less from each end of the intended width of the door opening.

(b) *Endurance test.* An edge sensor system and associated components shall withstand 30,000 cycles of mechanical operation without failure. For this test, the edge sensor is to be cycled by the repetitive application of the force as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The force is to be applied to the same location for the entire test. For an edge sensor system employing integral electric contact strips, this test shall be conducted with the contacts connected to a load no less severe than it controls in the operator. For the last 50 cycles of operation, the sensor shall function as intended when connected to an operator.

(c) *Elastomeric material conditioning test.* (1) An elastomeric material used as a functional part of an edge sensor shall function as intended when subjected to:

(i) Accelerated Aging Test of Gaskets, stated in paragraph (c)(3) of this section,

(ii) Compliance to the Standard for Gaskets and Seals, UL 157, fulfills this requirement (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section for UL contact information); and

(iii) Puncture Resistance Test, stated in paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) An elastomeric material used for a functional part that is exposed to outdoor weather conditions when the door is in the closed position shall have physical properties as specified in the table to subpart A after being conditioned in accordance with the Ultraviolet Light Exposure Test described in UL 746C (incorporated by reference, see § 1211.40).

(3) Rubber compounds forming gaskets that are depended upon for protection from rain shall have physical properties as specified in table 1, before and after conditioning for 168 hours in an air-circulating oven at 70 °C (158 °F).

(d) *Puncture resistance test.* (1) After being subjected to the tests described in paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, an elastomeric material that is a functional part of an edge sensor shall:

(i) Not be damaged in a manner that would adversely affect the intended operation of the edge sensor, and

(ii) Maintain enclosure integrity if it serves to reduce the likelihood of contamination of electrical contacts.

(2) For a vertically moving door, a sample of the edge sensor is to be installed in the intended manner on a representative door edge. The probe described in figure 7 to subpart A is to be applied with a 20 pound-force (89N) to any point on the sensor that is 3 inches (76 mm) or less above the floor is to be applied in the direction specified in the Edge Sensor Normal Operation Test, Figure 6 to Subpart A. The test is to be repeated on three locations on each surface of the sensor being tested.

(3) For horizontally sliding doors, sample of the edge sensor is to be installed in the intended manner on a representative door edge. The probe described in figure 7 to subpart A is to be applied with a 20 lbf (89 N) to any point on the sensor when the door is within 3 in (76 mm) of its fully open position and within 3 in (76 mm) of any stationary wall. For each type of door, the force is to be applied in the direction specified in the Edge Sensor Normal Operation Test, Figure 6 to Subpart A. The test is to be repeated on three locations on each surface of the sensor being tested.
