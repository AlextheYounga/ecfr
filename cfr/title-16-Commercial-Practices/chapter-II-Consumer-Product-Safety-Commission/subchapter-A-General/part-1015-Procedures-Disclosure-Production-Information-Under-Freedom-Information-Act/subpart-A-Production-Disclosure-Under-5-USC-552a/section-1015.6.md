(a) When a requested record has been identified and is available for disclosure, the requester shall either be supplied with a copy or notified as to where and when the record will be made available for inspection. If a requester desires to inspect records at one of the regional offices of the Commission, the Secretary will ordinarily make the records available at the requested regional office. If the payment of fees is required the requester shall be advised by the Secretary in writing of any applicable fees under ยง 1015.9 hereof.

(b) A response denying a written request for a record shall be in writing signed by the Secretary or delegate of the Secretary and shall include:

(1) The identity of each person responsible for the denial.

(2) A reference to the specific exemption or exemptions under the Freedom of Information Act authorizing the withholding of the record with a brief explanation of how the exemption applies to the record withheld; and

(3) An estimation of the volume of requested material withheld. When only a portion or portions of a document are withheld, the amount of information deleted shall be indicated on the released portion(s) of the record. When technically feasible, the indication of the amount of material withheld will appear at the place in the document where any deletion is made. Neither an estimation of the volume of requested material nor an indication of the amount of information deleted shall be included in a response if doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 552(b) pursuant to which the material is withheld.

(4) A statement that the denial may be appealed to the Commissioners of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Any such appeal must be made within 30 calendar days of receipt of the denial by the requester.

(c) If no response is made within twenty (20) working days or any extension thereof, the requester can consider his or her administrative remedies exhausted and seek judicial relief in a United States District Court as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B). When it appears that no response can be made to the requester within the applicable time limit, the Secretary or delegate of the Secretary may ask the requester to forego judicial relief until a response can be made. The Secretary or delegate of the Secretary shall inform the requester of the reason for the delay, of the date on which a response may be expected and of his/her right to seek judicial review as specified in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(B).
