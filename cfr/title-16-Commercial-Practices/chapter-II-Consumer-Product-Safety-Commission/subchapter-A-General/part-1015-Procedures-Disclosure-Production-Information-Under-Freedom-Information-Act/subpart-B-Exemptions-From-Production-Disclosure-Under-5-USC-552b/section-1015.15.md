##### ยง 1015.15 Purpose and scope. #####

(a) The regulations of this subpart provide information concerning the types of records which may be withheld from production and disclosure by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the internal Commission procedure for withholding exempt records. These regulations also provide information on the method whereby persons submitting information to the Commission may request that the information be considered exempt from disclosure, and information concerning the Commission's treatment of documents submitted with a request that they be treated as exempt from disclosure.

(b) No identifiable record requested in accordance with the procedures contained in this part shall be withheld from disclosure unless it falls within one of the classes of records exempt under 5 U.S.C 552(b). The Commission will make available, to the extent permitted by law, records authorized to be withheld under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) unless the Commission determines that disclosure is contrary to the public interest. In this regard the Commission will not ordinarily release documents that provide legal advice to the Commission concerning pending or prospective litigation where the release of such documents would significantly interfere with the Commission's regulatory or enforcement proceedings.

(c) Draft documents that are agency records are subject to release upon request in accordance with this regulation. However, in order to avoid any misunderstanding of the preliminary nature of a draft document, each draft document released will be marked to indicate its tentative nature. Similarly, staff briefing packages, which have been completed but not yet transmitted to the Commission by the Office of the Secretary are subject to release upon request in accordance with this regulation. Each briefing package or portion thereof released will be marked to indicate that it has not been transmitted to or acted upon by the Commission. In addition, briefing packages, or portions thereof, which the Secretary upon the advice of the Office of the General Counsel has determined would be released upon request in accordance with this regulation, will be publicly available in the public reference facility established under ยง 1015.2 promptly after the briefing package has been transmitted to the Commissioners by the Office of the Secretary. Such packages will be marked to indicate that they have not been acted upon by the Commission.

(d) The exceptions contained in ยง 1015.16 are as contained in 5 U.S.C. 552(b). These exemptions will be interpreted in accordance with the applicable law at the time a request for production or disclosure is considered.
