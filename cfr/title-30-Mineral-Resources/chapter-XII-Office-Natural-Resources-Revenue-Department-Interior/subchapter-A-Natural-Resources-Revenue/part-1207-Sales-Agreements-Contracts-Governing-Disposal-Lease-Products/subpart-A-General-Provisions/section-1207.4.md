##### ยง 1207.4 Contracts made pursuant to old form leases. #####

(a) Old form leases are those containing provisions prohibiting sales or disposal of oil, gas, natural gasoline, and other products of the lease except in accordance with a contract or other arrangement approved by the Secretary of the Interior, or by the Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) or his/her representative. A contract or agreement made pursuant to an old form lease may be made without obtaining approval if the contract or agreement contains either the substance of or is accompanied by the stipulation set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, signed by the seller (lessee or operator).

(b) The stipulation, the substance of which must be included in the contract, or be made the subject matter of a separate instrument properly identifying the leases affected thereby, is as follows:

It is hereby understood and agreed that nothing in the written contract or in any approval thereof shall be construed as affecting any of the relations between the United States and its lessee, particularly in matters of gas waste, taking royalty in kind, and the method of computing royalties due as based on a minimum valuation and in accordance with the terms and provisions of the oil and gas valuation regulations applicable to the lands covered by said contract.
