(a) You must place coal in marketable condition and market the coal for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to the Indian lessor.

(b) If you use gross proceeds under an arm's-length contract to determine royalty, you must increase those gross proceeds to the extent that the purchaser, or any other person, provides certain services that you normally are responsible to perform in order to place the coal in marketable condition or to market the coal.
