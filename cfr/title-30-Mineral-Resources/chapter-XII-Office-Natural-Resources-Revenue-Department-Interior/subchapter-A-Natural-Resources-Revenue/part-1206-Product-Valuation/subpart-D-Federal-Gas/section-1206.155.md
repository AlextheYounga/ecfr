(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, where the lessee (or a person to whom the lessee has transferred gas pursuant to a non-arm's-length contract or without a contract) processes the lessee's gas and after processing the gas the residue gas is not sold pursuant to an arm's-length contract, the value, for royalty purposes, shall be the greater of:

(1) The combined value, for royalty purposes, of the residue gas and gas plant products resulting from processing the gas determined pursuant to § 1206.153 of this subpart, plus the value, for royalty purposes, of any condensate recovered downstream of the point of royalty settlement without resorting to processing determined pursuant to § 1206.102 of this subpart; or

(2) The value, for royalty purposes, of the gas prior to processing determined in accordance with § 1206.152 of this subpart.
