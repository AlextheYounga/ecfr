##### ยง 1206.157 Determination of transportation allowances. #####

(a) *Arm's-length transportation contracts.* (1)(i) For transportation costs incurred by a lessee under an arm's-length contract, the transportation allowance shall be the reasonable, actual costs incurred by the lessee for transporting the unprocessed gas, residue gas and/or gas plant products under that contract, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee shall have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. ONRR's prior approval is not required before a lessee may deduct costs incurred under an arm's-length contract. Such allowances shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section. The lessee must claim a transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate entry on the form ONRR-2014.

(ii) In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether or not the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from the lessee to the transporter for the transportation. If the contract reflects more than the total consideration, then the ONRR may require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(iii) If the ONRR determines that the consideration paid pursuant to an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the transportation because of misconduct by or between the contracting parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the transportation allowance be determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. When ONRR determines that the value of the transportation may be unreasonable, ONRR will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide written information justifying the lessee's transportation costs.

(2)(i) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes more than one product in a gaseous phase and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, the total transportation costs shall be allocated in a consistent and equitable manner to each of the products transported in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this paragraph, no allowance may be taken for the costs of transporting lease production which is not royalty bearing without ONRR approval.

(ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, the lessee may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method on the basis of the values of the products transported. ONRR shall approve the method unless it determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this part.

(3) If an arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous and liquid products and the transportation costs attributable to each cannot be determined from the contract, the lessee shall propose an allocation procedure to ONRR. The lessee may use the transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues its determination on the acceptability of the cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all relevant data to support its proposal. ONRR shall then determine the gas transportation allowance based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary. The lessee must submit the allocation proposal within 3 months of claiming the allocated deduction on the form ONRR-2014.

(4) Where the lessee's payments for transportation under an arm's-length contract are not based on a dollar per unit, the lessee shall convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar value equivalent for the purposes of this section.

(5) Where an arm's-length sales contract price or a posted price includes a provision whereby the listed price is reduced by a transportation factor, ONRR will not consider the transportation factor to be a transportation allowance. The transportation factor may be used in determining the lessee's gross proceeds for the sale of the product. The transportation factor may not exceed 50 percent of the base price of the product without ONRR approval.

(b) *Non-arm's-length or no contract.* (1) If a lessee has a non-arm's-length transportation contract or has no contract, including those situations where the lessee performs transportation services for itself, the transportation allowance will be based upon the lessee's reasonable actual costs as provided in this paragraph. All transportation allowances deducted under a non-arm's-length or no contract situation are subject to monitoring, review, audit, and adjustment. The lessee must claim a transportation allowance by reporting it as a separate entry on the form ONRR-2014. When necessary or appropriate, ONRR may direct a lessee to modify its estimated or actual transportation allowance deduction.

(2) The transportation allowance for non-arm's-length or no-contract situations shall be based upon the lessee's actual costs for transportation during the reporting period, including operating and maintenance expenses, overhead, and either depreciation and a return on undepreciated capital investment in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, or a cost equal to the initial depreciable investment in the transportation system multiplied by a rate of return in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(B) of this section. Allowable capital costs are generally those costs for depreciable fixed assets (including costs of delivery and installation of capital equipment) which are an integral part of the transportation system.

(i) Allowable operating expenses include: Operations supervision and engineering; operations labor; fuel; utilities; materials; ad valorem property taxes; rent; supplies; and any other directly allocable and attributable operating expense which the lessee can document.

(ii) Allowable maintenance expenses include: Maintenance of the transportation system; maintenance of equipment; maintenance labor; and other directly allocable and attributable maintenance expenses which the lessee can document.

(iii) Overhead directly attributable and allocable to the operation and maintenance of the transportation system is an allowable expense. State and Federal income taxes and severance taxes and other fees, including royalties, are not allowable expenses.

(iv) A lessee may use either depreciation or a return on depreciable capital investment. After a lessee has elected to use either method for a transportation system, the lessee may not later elect to change to the other alternative without approval of the ONRR.

(A) To compute depreciation, the lessee may elect to use either a straight-line depreciation method based on the life of equipment or on the life of the reserves which the transportation system services, or a unit of production method. After an election is made, the lessee may not change methods without ONRR approval. A change in ownership of a transportation system shall not alter the depreciation schedule established by the original transporter/lessee for purposes of the allowance calculation. With or without a change in ownership, a transportation system shall be depreciated only once. Equipment shall not be depreciated below a reasonable salvage value.

(B) The ONRR shall allow as a cost an amount equal to the allowable initial capital investment in the transportation system multiplied by the rate of return determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. No allowance shall be provided for depreciation. This alternative shall apply only to transportation facilities first placed in service after March 1, 1988.

(v) The rate of return must be 1.3 times the industrial rate associated with Standard & Poor's BBB rating. The BBB rate must be the monthly average rate as published in Standard & Poor's Bond Guide for the first month for which the allowance is applicable. The rate must be redetermined at the beginning of each subsequent calendar year.

(3)(i) The deduction for transportation costs shall be determined on the basis of the lessee's cost of transporting each product through each individual transportation system. Where more than one product in a gaseous phase is transported, the allocation of costs to each of the products transported shall be made in a consistent and equitable manner in the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products which have no value) to the volume of all products in the gaseous phase (excluding waste products which have no value). Except as provided in this paragraph, the lessee may not take an allowance for transporting a product which is not royalty bearing without ONRR approval.

(ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the lessee may propose to the ONRR a cost allocation method on the basis of the values of the products transported. ONRR shall approve the method unless it determines that it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this part.

(4) Where both gaseous and liquid products are transported through the same transportation system, the lessee shall propose a cost allocation procedure to ONRR. The lessee may use the transportation allowance determined in accordance with its proposed allocation procedure until ONRR issues its determination on the acceptability of the cost allocation. The lessee shall submit all relevant data to support its proposal. ONRR shall then determine the transportation allowance based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information ONRR deems necessary. The lessee must submit the allocation proposal within 3 months of claiming the allocated deduction on the form ONRR-2014.

(5) You may apply for an exception from the requirement to compute actual costs under paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section.

(i) ONRR will grant the exception if:

(A) The transportation system has a tariff filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or a State regulatory agency, that FERC or the State regulatory agency has permitted to become effective, and

(B) Third parties are paying prices, including discounted prices, under the tariff to transport gas on the system under arm's-length transportation contracts.

(ii) If ONRR approves the exception, you must calculate your transportation allowance for each production month based on the lesser of the volume-weighted average of the rates paid by the third parties under arm's-length transportation contracts during that production month or the non-arm's-length payment by the lessee to the pipeline.

(iii) If during any production month there are no prices paid under the tariff by third parties to transport gas on the system under arm's-length transportation contracts, you may use the volume-weighted average of the rates paid by third parties under arm's-length transportation contracts in the most recent preceding production month in which the tariff remains in effect and third parties paid such rates, for up to five successive production months. You must use the non-arm's-length payment by the lessee to the pipeline if it is less than the volume-weighted average of the rates paid by third parties under arm's-length contracts.

(c) *Reporting requirements* - (1) *Arm's-length contracts.* (i) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of a transportation allowance.

(ii) ONRR may require you to submit arm's-length transportation contracts, production agreements, operating agreements, and related documents. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 1207 of this chapter.

(iii) You may not use a transportation allowance that was in effect before March 1, 1988. You must use the provisions of this subpart to determine your transportation allowance.

(2) *Non-arm's-length or no contract.* (i) You must use a separate entry on form ONRR-2014 to notify ONRR of a transportation allowance.

(ii) For new transportation facilities or arrangements, base your initial deduction on estimates of allowable gas transportation costs for the applicable period. Use the most recently available operations data for the transportation system or, if such data are not available, use estimates based on data for similar transportation systems. Paragraph (e) of this section will apply when you amend your report based on your actual costs.

(iii) ONRR may require you to submit all data used to calculate the allowance deduction. Recordkeeping requirements are found at part 1207 of this chapter.

(iv) If you are authorized under paragraph (b)(5) of this section to use an exception to the requirement to calculate your actual transportation costs, you must follow the reporting requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(v) You may not use a transportation allowance that was in effect before March 1, 1988. You must use the provisions of this subpart to determine your transportation allowance.

(d) *Interest and assessments.* (1) If a lessee deducts a transportation allowance on its form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the gas transported without obtaining prior approval of ONRR under ยง 1206.156, the lessee shall pay interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date such amount is taken to the date the lessee files an exception request with ONRR.

(2) If a lessee erroneously reports a transportation allowance which results in an underpayment of royalties, interest shall be paid on the amount of that underpayment.

(3) Interest required to be paid by this section shall be determined in accordance with ยง 1218.54 of this chapter.

(e) *Adjustments.* (1) If the actual transportation allowance is less than the amount the lessee has taken on form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be required to pay additional royalties due plus interest computed under ยง 1218.54 of this chapter from the allowance reporting period when the lessee took the deduction to the date the lessee repays the difference to ONRR. If the actual transportation allowance is greater than the amount the lessee has taken on form ONRR-2014 for each month during the allowance reporting period, the lessee shall be entitled to a credit without interest.

(2) For lessees transporting production from onshore Federal leases, the lessee must submit a corrected form ONRR-2014 to reflect actual costs, together with any payment, in accordance with instructions provided by ONRR.

(3) For lessees transporting gas production from leases on the OCS, if the lessee's estimated transportation allowance exceeds the allowance based on actual costs, the lessee must submit a corrected form ONRR-2014 to reflect actual costs, together with its payment, in accordance with instructions provided by ONRR. If the lessee's estimated transportation allowance is less than the allowance based on actual costs, the refund procedure will be specified by ONRR.

(f) *Allowable costs in determining transportation allowances.* You may include, but are not limited to (subject to the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section), the following costs in determining the arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section or the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of this section. You may not use any cost as a deduction that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this paragraph.

(1) *Firm demand charges paid to pipelines.* You may deduct firm demand charges or capacity reservation fees paid to a pipeline, including charges or fees for unused firm capacity that you have not sold before you report your allowance. If you receive a payment from any party for release or sale of firm capacity after reporting a transportation allowance that included the cost of that unused firm capacity, or if you receive a payment or credit from the pipeline for penalty refunds, rate case refunds, or other reasons, you must reduce the firm demand charge claimed on the form ONRR-2014 by the amount of that payment. You must modify the form ONRR-2014 by the amount received or credited for the affected reporting period, and pay any resulting royalty and late payment interest due;

(2) *Gas supply realignment (GSR) costs.* The GSR costs result from a pipeline reforming or terminating supply contracts with producers to implement the restructuring requirements of FERC Orders in 18 CFR part 284;

(3) *Commodity charges.* The commodity charge allows the pipeline to recover the costs of providing service;

(4) *Wheeling costs.* Hub operators charge a wheeling cost for transporting gas from one pipeline to either the same or another pipeline through a market center or hub. A hub is a connected manifold of pipelines through which a series of incoming pipelines are interconnected to a series of outgoing pipelines;

(5) *Gas Research Institute (GRI) fees.* The GRI conducts research, development, and commercialization programs on natural gas related topics for the benefit of the U.S. gas industry and gas customers. GRI fees are allowable provided such fees are mandatory in FERC-approved tariffs;

(6) *Annual Charge Adjustment (ACA) fees.* FERC charges these fees to pipelines to pay for its operating expenses;

(7) *Payments (either volumetric or in value) for actual or theoretical losses.* However, theoretical losses are not deductible in non-arm's-length transportation arrangements unless the transportation allowance is based on arm's-length transportation rates charged under a FERC- or State regulatory-approved tariff under paragraph (b)(5) of this section. If you receive volumes or credit for line gain, you must reduce your transportation allowance accordingly and pay any resulting royalties and late payment interest due;

(8) *Temporary storage services.* This includes short duration storage services offered by market centers or hubs (commonly referred to as โparkingโ or โbankingโ), or other temporary storage services provided by pipeline transporters, whether actual or provided as a matter of accounting. Temporary storage is limited to 30 days or less; and

(9) *Supplemental costs for compression, dehydration, and treatment of gas.* ONRR allows these costs only if such services are required for transportation and exceed the services necessary to place production into marketable condition required under ยงยง 1206.152(i) and 1206.153(i) of this part.

(10) *Costs of surety.* You may deduct the costs of securing a letter of credit, or other surety, that the pipeline requires you as a shipper to maintain under an arm's-length transportation contract.

(g) *Nonallowable costs in determining transportation allowances.* Lessees may not include the following costs in determining the arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (a) of this section or the non-arm's-length transportation allowance under paragraph (b) of this section:

(1) *Fees or costs incurred for storage.* This includes storing production in a storage facility, whether on or off the lease, for more than 30 days;

(2) *Aggregator/marketer fees.* This includes fees you pay to another person (including your affiliates) to market your gas, including purchasing and reselling the gas, or finding or maintaining a market for the gas production;

(3) *Penalties you incur as shipper.* These penalties include, but are not limited to:

(i) *Over-delivery cash-out penalties.* This includes the difference between the price the pipeline pays you for over-delivered volumes outside the tolerances and the price you receive for over-delivered volumes within the tolerances;

(ii) *Scheduling penalties.* This includes penalties you incur for differences between daily volumes delivered into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point;

(iii) *Imbalance penalties.* This includes penalties you incur (generally on a monthly basis) for differences between volumes delivered into the pipeline and volumes scheduled or nominated at a receipt or delivery point; and

(iv) *Operational penalties.* This includes fees you incur for violation of the pipeline's curtailment or operational orders issued to protect the operational integrity of the pipeline;

(4) *Intra-hub transfer fees.* These are fees you pay to hub operators for administrative services (*e.g.,* title transfer tracking) necessary to account for the sale of gas within a hub;

(5) *Fees paid to brokers.* This includes fees paid to parties who arrange marketing or transportation, if such fees are separately identified from aggregator/marketer fees;

(6) *Fees paid to scheduling service providers.* This includes fees paid to parties who provide scheduling services, if such fees are separately identified from aggregator/marketer fees;

(7) *Internal costs.* This includes salaries and related costs, rent/space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to schedule, nominate, and account for sale or movement of production; and

(8) *Other nonallowable costs.* Any cost you incur for services you are required to provide at no cost to the lessor.

(h) *Other transportation cost determinations.* Use this section when calculating transportation costs to establish value using a netback procedure or any other procedure that requires deduction of transportation costs.
