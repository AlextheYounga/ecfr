##### ยง 1206.151 Definitions. #####

For purposes of this subpart:

*Affiliate* means a person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. For purposes of this subpart:

(1) Ownership or common ownership of more than 50 percent of the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person constitutes control. Ownership of less than 10 percent constitutes a presumption of noncontrol that ONRR may rebut.

(2) If there is ownership or common ownership of 10 through 50 percent of the voting securities or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership, of another person, ONRR will consider the following factors in determining whether there is control under the circumstances of a particular case:

(i) The extent to which there are common officers or directors;

(ii) With respect to the voting securities, or instruments of ownership, or other forms of ownership: The percentage of ownership or common ownership, the relative percentage of ownership or common ownership compared to the percentage(s) of ownership by other persons, whether a person is the greatest single owner, or whether there is an opposing voting bloc of greater ownership;

(iii) Operation of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility;

(iv) The extent of participation by other owners in operations and day-to-day management of a lease, plant, pipeline, or other facility; and

(v) Other evidence of power to exercise control over or common control with another person.

(3) Regardless of any percentage of ownership or common ownership, relatives, either by blood or marriage, are affiliates.

*Allowance* means a deduction in determining value for royalty purposes. *Processing allowance* means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of processing gas determined under this subpart. *Transportation allowance* means an allowance for the reasonable, actual costs of moving unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products to a point of sale or delivery off the lease, unit area, or communitized area, or away from a processing plant. The transportation allowance does not include gathering costs.

*Area* means a geographic region at least as large as the defined limits of an oil and/or gas field, in which oil and/or gas lease products have similar quality, economic, and legal characteristics.

*Arm's-length contract* means a contract or agreement between independent persons who are not affiliates and who have opposing economic interests regarding that contract. To be considered arm's length for any production month, a contract must satisfy this definition for that month, as well as when the contract was executed.

*Audit* means a review, conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting and auditing standards, of royalty payment compliance activities of lessees or other interest holders who pay royalties, rents, or bonuses on Federal leases.

*BLM* means the Bureau of Land Management of the Department of the Interior.

*BOEM* means the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management of the Department of the Interior.

*BSEE* means the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement of the Department of the Interior.

*Compression* means the process of raising the pressure of gas.

*Condensate* means liquid hydrocarbons (normally exceeding 40 degrees of API gravity) recovered at the surface without resorting to processing. Condensate is the mixture of liquid hydrocarbons that results from condensation of petroleum hydrocarbons existing initially in a gaseous phase in an underground reservoir.

*Contract* means any oral or written agreement, including amendments or revisions thereto, between two or more persons and enforceable by law that with due consideration creates an obligation.

*Field* means a geographic region situated over one or more subsurface oil and gas reservoirs encompassing at least the outermost boundaries of all oil and gas accumulations known to be within those reservoirs vertically projected to the land surface. Onshore fields are usually given names and their official boundaries are often designated by oil and gas regulatory agencies in the respective States in which the fields are located. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) fields are named and their boundaries are designated by BOEM.

*Gas* means any fluid, either combustible or noncombustible, hydrocarbon or nonhydrocarbon, which is extracted from a reservoir and which has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand indefinitely. It is a substance that exists in a gaseous or rarefied state under standard temperature and pressure conditions.

*Gas plant products* means separate marketable elements, compounds, or mixtures, whether in liquid, gaseous, or solid form, resulting from processing gas, excluding residue gas.

*Gathering* means the movement of lease production to a central accumulation and/or treatment point on the lease, unit or communitized area, or to a central accumulation or treatment point off the lease, unit or communitized area as approved by BLM or BSEE OCS operations personnel for onshore and OCS leases, respectively.

*Gross proceeds* (for royalty payment purposes) means the total monies and other consideration accruing to an oil and gas lessee for the disposition of the gas, residue gas, and gas plant products produced. Gross proceeds includes, but is not limited to, payments to the lessee for certain services such as dehydration, measurement, and/or gathering to the extent that the lessee is obligated to perform them at no cost to the Federal Government. Tax reimbursements are part of the gross proceeds accruing to a lessee even though the Federal royalty interest may be exempt from taxation. Monies and other consideration, including the forms of consideration identified in this paragraph, to which a lessee is contractually or legally entitled but which it does not seek to collect through reasonable efforts are also part of gross proceeds.

*Lease* means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture, or other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a mineral leasing law that authorizes exploration for, development or extraction of, or removal of lease products - or the land area covered by that authorization, whichever is required by the context.

*Lease products* means any leased minerals attributable to, originating from, or allocated to Outer Continental Shelf or onshore Federal leases.

*Lessee* means any person to whom the United States issues a lease, and any person who has been assigned an obligation to make royalty or other payments required by the lease. This includes any person who has an interest in a lease as well as an operator or payor who has no interest in the lease but who has assumed the royalty payment responsibility.

*Like-quality lease products* means lease products which have similar chemical, physical, and legal characteristics.

*Marketable condition* means lease products which are sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that they will be accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical for the field or area.

*Marketing affiliate* means an affiliate of the lessee whose function is to acquire only the lessee's production and to market that production.

*Minimum royalty* means that minimum amount of annual royalty that the lessee must pay as specified in the lease or in applicable leasing regulations.

*Net-back method* (or work-back method) means a method for calculating market value of gas at the lease. Under this method, costs of transportation, processing, or manufacturing are deducted from the proceeds received for the gas, residue gas or gas plant products, and any extracted, processed, or manufactured products, or from the value of the gas, residue gas or gas plant products, and any extracted, processed, or manufactured products, at the first point at which reasonable values for any such products may be determined by a sale pursuant to an arm's-length contract or comparison to other sales of such products, to ascertain value at the lease.

*Net output* means the quantity of residue gas and each gas plant product that a processing plant produces.

*Net profit share* (for applicable Federal leases) means the specified share of the net profit from production of oil and gas as provided in the agreement.

*Netting* means the deduction of an allowance from the sales value by reporting a net sales value, instead of correctly reporting the deduction as a separate entry on form ONRR-2014.

*Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)* means all submerged lands lying seaward and outside of the area of land beneath navigable waters as defined in section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) and of which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction and control.

*Person* means any individual, firm, corporation, association, partnership, consortium, or joint venture (when established as a separate entity).

*Posted price* means the price, net of all adjustments for quality and location, specified in publicly available price bulletins or other price notices available as part of normal business operations for quantities of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products in marketable condition.

*Processing* means any process designed to remove elements or compounds (hydrocarbon and nonhydrocarbon) from gas, including absorption, adsorption, or refrigeration. Field processes which normally take place on or near the lease, such as natural pressure reduction, mechanical separation, heating, cooling, dehydration, and compression, are not considered processing. The changing of pressures and/or temperatures in a reservoir is not considered processing.

*Residue gas* means that hydrocarbon gas consisting principally of methane resulting from processing gas.

*Sales type code* means the contract type or general disposition (*e.g.,* arm's-length or non-arm's-length) of production from the lease. The sales type code applies to the sales contract, or other disposition, and not to the arm's-length or non-arm's-length nature of a transportation or processing allowance.

*Section 6 lease* means an OCS lease subject to section 6 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, as amended, 43 U.S.C. 1335.

*Spot sales agreement* means a contract wherein a seller agrees to sell to a buyer a specified amount of unprocessed gas, residue gas, or gas plant products at a specified price over a fixed period, usually of short duration, which does not normally require a cancellation notice to terminate, and which does not contain an obligation, nor imply an intent, to continue in subsequent periods.

*Warranty contract* means a long-term contract entered into prior to 1970, including any amendments thereto, for the sale of gas wherein the producer agrees to sell a specific amount of gas and the gas delivered in satisfaction of this obligation may come from fields or sources outside of the designated fields.
