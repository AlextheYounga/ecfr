##### § 1206.110 How do I determine a transportation allowance under an arm's-length transportation contract? #####

(a) If you or your affiliate incur transportation costs under an arm's-length transportation contract, you may claim a transportation allowance for the reasonable, actual costs incurred as more fully explained in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section and subject to the limitation in § 1206.109(c). You must be able to demonstrate that your or your affiliate's contract is at arm's length. You do not need ONRR approval before reporting a transportation allowance for costs incurred under an arm's-length transportation contract.

(1) If ONRR determines that the contract reflects more than the consideration actually transferred either directly or indirectly from you or your affiliate to the transporter for the transportation, ONRR may require that you calculate the transportation allowance under § 1206.111.

(2) You must calculate the transportation allowance under § 1206.111 if ONRR determines that the consideration paid under an arm's-length transportation contract does not reflect the reasonable value of the transportation due to either:

(i) Misconduct by or between the parties to the arm's-length contract; or

(ii) Breach of your duty to market the oil for the mutual benefit of yourself and the lessor.

(A) ONRR will not use this provision to simply substitute its judgment of the reasonable oil transportation costs incurred by you or your affiliate under an arm's-length transportation contract.

(B) The fact that the cost you or your affiliate incur in an arm's-length transaction is higher than other measures of transportation costs, such as rates paid by others in the field or area, is insufficient to establish breach of the duty to market unless ONRR finds additional evidence that you or your affiliate acted unreasonably or in bad faith in transporting oil from the lease.

(b) You may deduct any of the following actual costs you (including your affiliates) incur for transporting oil. You may not use as a deduction any cost that duplicates all or part of any other cost that you use under this paragraph.

(1) The amount that you pay under your arm's-length transportation contract or tariff.

(2) Fees paid (either in volume or in value) for actual or theoretical line losses.

(3) Fees paid for administration of a quality bank.

(4) The cost of carrying on your books as inventory a volume of oil that the pipeline operator requires you to maintain, and that you do maintain, in the line as line fill. You must calculate this cost as follows:

(i) Multiply the volume that the pipeline requires you to maintain, and that you do maintain, in the pipeline by the value of that volume for the current month calculated under § 1206.102 or § 1206.103, as applicable; and

(ii) Multiply the value calculated under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section by the monthly rate of return, calculated by dividing the rate of return specified in § 1206.111(i)(2) by 12.

(5) Fees paid to a terminal operator for loading and unloading of crude oil into or from a vessel, vehicle, pipeline, or other conveyance.

(6) Fees paid for short-term storage (30 days or less) incidental to transportation as required by a transporter.

(7) Fees paid to pump oil to another carrier's system or vehicles as required under a tariff.

(8) Transfer fees paid to a hub operator associated with physical movement of crude oil through the hub when you do not sell the oil at the hub. These fees do not include title transfer fees.

(9) Payments for a volumetric deduction to cover shrinkage when high-gravity petroleum (generally in excess of 51 degrees API) is mixed with lower-gravity crude oil for transportation.

(10) Costs of securing a letter of credit, or other surety, that the pipeline requires you as a shipper to maintain.

(c) You may not deduct any costs that are not actual costs of transporting oil, including but not limited to the following:

(1) Fees paid for long-term storage (more than 30 days).

(2) Administrative, handling, and accounting fees associated with terminalling.

(3) Title and terminal transfer fees.

(4) Fees paid to track and match receipts and deliveries at a market center or to avoid paying title transfer fees.

(5) Fees paid to brokers.

(6) Fees paid to a scheduling service provider.

(7) Internal costs, including salaries and related costs, rent/space costs, office equipment costs, legal fees, and other costs to schedule, nominate, and account for sale or movement of production.

(8) Gauging fees.

(d) If your arm's-length transportation contract includes more than one liquid product, and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, then you must allocate the total transportation costs to each of the liquid products transported.

(1) Your allocation must use the same proportion as the ratio of the volume of each product (excluding waste products with no value) to the volume of all liquid products (excluding waste products with no value).

(2) You may not claim an allowance for the costs of transporting lease production that is not royalty-bearing.

(3) You may propose to ONRR a cost allocation method on the basis of the values of the products transported. ONRR will approve the method unless it is not consistent with the purposes of the regulations in this subpart.

(e) If your arm's-length transportation contract includes both gaseous and liquid products, and the transportation costs attributable to each product cannot be determined from the contract, then you must propose an allocation procedure to ONRR.

(1) You may use your proposed procedure to calculate a transportation allowance until ONRR accepts or rejects your cost allocation. If ONRR rejects your cost allocation, you must amend your form ONRR-2014 for the months that you used the rejected method and pay any additional royalty and interest due.

(2) You must submit your initial proposal, including all available data, within 3 months after first claiming the allocated deductions on form ONRR-2014.

(f) If your payments for transportation under an arm's-length contract are not on a dollar-per-unit basis, you must convert whatever consideration is paid to a dollar-value equivalent.

(g) If your arm's-length sales contract includes a provision reducing the contract price by a transportation factor, do not separately report the transportation factor as a transportation allowance on form ONRR-2014.

(1) You may use the transportation factor in determining your gross proceeds for the sale of the product.

(2) You must obtain ONRR approval before claiming a transportation factor in excess of 50 percent of the base price of the product.
