##### ยง 1206.116 What interest applies if I improperly report a transportation allowance? #####

(a) If you or your affiliate deducts a transportation allowance on form ONRR-2014 that exceeds 50 percent of the value of the oil transported without obtaining ONRR's prior approval under ยง 1206.109, you must pay interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date that amount is taken to the date you or your affiliate files an exception request that ONRR approves. If you do not file an exception request, or if ONRR does not approve your request, you must pay interest on the excess allowance amount taken from the date that amount is taken until the date you pay the additional royalties owed.

(b) If you or your affiliate takes a deduction for transportation on form ONRR-2014 by improperly netting an allowance against the oil instead of reporting the allowance as a separate entry, ONRR may assess a civil penalty under 30 CFR part 1241.
