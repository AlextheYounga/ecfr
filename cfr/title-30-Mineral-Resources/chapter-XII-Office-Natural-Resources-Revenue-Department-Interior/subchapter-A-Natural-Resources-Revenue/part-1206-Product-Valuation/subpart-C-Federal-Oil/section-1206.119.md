##### ยง 1206.119 How are royalty quantity and quality determined? #####

(a) Compute royalties based on the quantity and quality of oil as measured at the point of settlement approved by BLM for onshore leases or BSEE for offshore leases.

(b) If the value of oil determined under this subpart is based upon a quantity or quality different from the quantity or quality at the point of royalty settlement approved by the BLM for onshore leases or BSEE for offshore leases, adjust the value for those differences in quantity or quality.

(c) Any actual loss that you may incur before the royalty settlement metering or measurement point is not subject to royalty if BLM or BSEE, as appropriate, determines that the loss is unavoidable.

(d) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, royalties are due on 100 percent of the volume measured at the approved point of royalty settlement. You may not claim a reduction in that measured volume for actual losses beyond the approved point of royalty settlement or for theoretical losses that are claimed to have taken place either before or after the approved point of royalty settlement.
