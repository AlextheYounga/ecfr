##### § 1206.103 How do I value oil that is not sold under an arm's-length contract? #####

This section explains how to value oil that you may not value under § 1206.102 or that you elect under § 1206.102(d) to value under this section. First determine whether paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section applies to production from your lease, or whether you may apply paragraph (d) or (e) with ONRR approval.

(a) *Production from leases in California or Alaska.* Value is the average of the daily mean ANS spot prices published in any ONRR-approved publication during the trading month most concurrent with the production month. (For example, if the production month is June, compute the average of the daily mean prices using the daily ANS spot prices published in the ONRR-approved publication for all the business days in June.)

(1) To calculate the daily mean spot price, average the daily high and low prices for the month in the selected publication.

(2) Use only the days and corresponding spot prices for which such prices are published.

(3) You must adjust the value for applicable location and quality differentials, and you may adjust it for transportation costs, under § 1206.112.

(4) After you select an ONRR-approved publication, you may not select a different publication more often than once every 2 years, unless the publication you use is no longer published or ONRR revokes its approval of the publication. If you are required to change publications, you must begin a new 2-year period.

(b) *Production from leases in the Rocky Mountain Region.* This paragraph provides methods and options for valuing your production under different factual situations. You must consistently apply paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section to value all of your production from the same unit, communitization agreement, or lease (if the lease or a portion of the lease is not part of a unit or communitization agreement) that you cannot value under § 1206.102 or that you elect under § 1206.102(d) to value under this section.

(1) If you have an ONRR-approved tendering program, you must value oil produced from leases in the area the tendering program covers at the highest winning bid price for tendered volumes.

(i) The minimum requirements for ONRR to approve your tendering program are:

(A) You must offer and sell at least 30 percent of your or your affiliates' production from both Federal and non-Federal leases in the area under your tendering program; and

(B) You must receive at least three bids for the tendered volumes from bidders who do not have their own tendering programs that cover some or all of the same area.

(ii) If you do not have an ONRR-approved tendering program, you may elect to value your oil under either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section. After you select either paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, you may not change to the other method more often than once every 2 years, unless the method you have been using is no longer applicable and you must apply the other paragraph. If you change methods, you must begin a new 2-year period.

(2) Value is the volume-weighted average of the gross proceeds accruing to the seller under your or your affiliates' arm's-length contracts for the purchase or sale of production from the field or area during the production month.

(i) The total volume purchased or sold under those contracts must exceed 50 percent of your and your affiliates' production from both Federal and non-Federal leases in the same field or area during that month.

(ii) Before calculating the volume-weighted average, you must normalize the quality of the oil in your or your affiliates' arm's-length purchases or sales to the same gravity as that of the oil produced from the lease.

(3) Value is the NYMEX price (without the roll), adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs under § 1206.112.

(4) If you demonstrate to ONRR's satisfaction that paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section result in an unreasonable value for your production as a result of circumstances regarding that production, the ONRR Director may establish an alternative valuation method.

(c) *Production from leases not located in California, Alaska, or the Rocky Mountain Region.* (1) Value is the NYMEX price, plus the roll, adjusted for applicable location and quality differentials and transportation costs under § 1206.112.

(2) If the ONRR Director determines that use of the roll no longer reflects prevailing industry practice in crude oil sales contracts or that) the most common formula used by industry to calculate the roll changes, ONRR may terminate or modify use of the roll under paragraph (c)(1) of this section at the end of each 2-year period following July 6, 2004, through notice published in the Federal Register not later than 60 days before the end of the 2-year period. ONRR will explain the rationale for terminating or modifying the use of the roll in this notice.

(d) *Unreasonable value.* If ONRR determines that the NYMEX price or ANS spot price does not represent a reasonable royalty value in any particular case, ONRR may establish reasonable royalty value based on other relevant matters.

(e) *Production delivered to your refinery and the NYMEX price or ANS spot price is an unreasonable value.* (1) Instead of valuing your production under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section, you may apply to the ONRR Director to establish a value representing the market at the refinery if:

(i) You transport your oil directly to your or your affiliate's refinery, or exchange your oil for oil delivered to your or your affiliate's refinery; and

(ii) You must value your oil under this section at the NYMEX price or ANS spot price; and

(iii) You believe that use of the NYMEX price or ANS spot price results in an unreasonable royalty value.

(2) You must provide adequate documentation and evidence demonstrating the market value at the refinery. That evidence may include, but is not limited to:

(i) Costs of acquiring other crude oil at or for the refinery;

(ii) How adjustments for quality, location, and transportation were factored into the price paid for other oil;

(iii) Volumes acquired for and refined at the refinery; and

(iv) Any other appropriate evidence or documentation that ONRR requires.

(3) If the ONRR Director establishes a value representing market value at the refinery, you may not take an allowance against that value under § 1206.112(b) unless it is included in the Director's approval.
