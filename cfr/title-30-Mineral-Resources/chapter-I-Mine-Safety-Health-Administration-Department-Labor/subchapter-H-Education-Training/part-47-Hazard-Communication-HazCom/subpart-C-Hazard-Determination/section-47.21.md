##### § 47.21 Identifying hazardous chemicals. #####

The operator must evaluate each chemical brought on mine property and each chemical produced on mine property to determine if it is hazardous as specified in Table 47.21 as follows:

|            Category             |                                                                                   Basis for determining if a chemical is hazardous                                                                                    |

|(a) Chemical brought to the mine |The chemical is hazardous when its MSDS or container label indicates it is a physical or health hazard; or the operator may choose to evaluate the chemical using the criteria in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this table.|
|(b) Chemical produced at the mine|                                                                      The chemical is hazardous if any one of the following that it is a hazard:                                                                       |
