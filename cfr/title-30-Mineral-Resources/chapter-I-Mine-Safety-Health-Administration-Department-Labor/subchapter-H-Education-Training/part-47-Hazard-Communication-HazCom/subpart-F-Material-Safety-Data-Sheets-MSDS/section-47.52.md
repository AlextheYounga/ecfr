(a) Be legible, accurate, and in English;

(b) Use a chemical identity that permits cross-referencing between the list of hazardous chemicals, the chemical's label, and its MSDS; and

(c) Contain information, or indicate if no information is available, for the categories listed in Table 47.52 as follows:
