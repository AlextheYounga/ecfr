##### ยง 36.45 Quantity of ventilating air. #####

(a) Results of the engine tests shall be used to calculate ventilation (cubic feet of air per minute) that shall be supplied by positive air movement when the permissible mobile diesel-powered transportation equipment is used underground. This quantity shall be stamped on the approval plate. The quantity so determined shall apply when only one machine is operated.

(b) Determination of the ventilation rate shall be based upon dilution of the exhaust gas with normal air. The most undesirable and hazardous condition of engine operation prescribed by MSHA shall be used in the calculations. The concentration of any of the following individual constituents in the diluted mixture shall not exceed:

0.25 percent, by volume, of carbon dioxide (CO2). 0.005 percent, by volume, of carbon monoxide (CO). 0.00125 percent, by volume, of oxides of nitrogen (calculated as equivalent nitrogen dioxide, NO2).The oxygen (O2) content of the diluted mixture shall be not less than 20 percent, by volume. The maximum quantity of normal air to produce the above dilution shall be designated the ventilation rate. Note:

This ventilation rate will provide a factor of safety for exposure of persons to air mixtures containing harmful or objectionable gases and for minor variations in engine performance.
