##### ยง 18.24 Electrical clearances. #####

Minimum clearances between uninsulated electrical conductor surfaces, or between uninsulated conductor surfaces and grounded metal surfaces, within the enclosure shall be as follows:

|Phase-to-Phase Voltage (rms)|       Clearances (inches)        |    |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----|
|       Phase-to-Phase       |Phase-to-Ground or Control Circuit|    |
|          0 to 250          |               0.25               |0.25|
|         251 to 600         |               0.28               |0.25|
|        601 to 1000         |               0.61               |0.25|
|        1001 to 2400        |               1.4                |0.6 |
|        2401 to 4160        |               3.0                |1.4 |
