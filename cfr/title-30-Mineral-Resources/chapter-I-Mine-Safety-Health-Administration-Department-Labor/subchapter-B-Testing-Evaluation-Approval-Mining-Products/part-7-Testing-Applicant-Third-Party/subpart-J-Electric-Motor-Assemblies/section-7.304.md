(14) Fastenings shall be used only for attaching parts that are essential in maintaining the explosion-proof integrity of the enclosure, or necessary for the operation of the motor. They shall not be used for making electrical connections.

(15) Through holes not in use shall be closed with a metal plug. Plugs, including eyebolts, in through holes where future access is desired shall meet the flame-arresting paths, lengths, and clearances of paragraph (g)(19) of this section and be secured by spot welding or brazing.
