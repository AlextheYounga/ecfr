(b) *Scope and level of detail.* The regulatory authority will determine the scope and level of detail for this information in coordination with state and federal agencies with responsibilities for fish and wildlife.

(2) Species or habitat protected by state or tribal endangered species statutes and regulations.

(3) Habitat of unusually high value for fish and wildlife, which may include wetlands, riparian areas, cliffs that provide nesting sites for raptors, significant migration corridors, specialized reproduction or wintering areas, areas offering special shelter or protection, and areas that support populations of endemic species that are vulnerable because of restricted ranges, limited mobility, limited reproductive capacity, or specialized habitat requirements.

(4) Other species or habitat identified through interagency coordination as requiring special protection under state, tribal, or federal law, including species identified as sensitive by a state, tribal, or federal agency.

(5) Perennial or intermittent streams.
