(b) The description and map required under paragraph (a) of this section must -

(1) Be in sufficient detail to assist in preparation of the revegetation plan under § 784.12(g) of this chapter and provide a baseline for comparison with postmining vegetation;

(2) Be adequate to evaluate whether the vegetation provides important habitat for fish and wildlife and whether the proposed permit area contains native plant communities of local or regional significance;

(3) Identify areas with significant populations of non-native invasive or noxious species; and

(4) Delineate all wetlands and all areas bordering streams that either support or are capable of supporting hydrophytic or hydrophilic vegetation or vegetation typical of floodplains.
