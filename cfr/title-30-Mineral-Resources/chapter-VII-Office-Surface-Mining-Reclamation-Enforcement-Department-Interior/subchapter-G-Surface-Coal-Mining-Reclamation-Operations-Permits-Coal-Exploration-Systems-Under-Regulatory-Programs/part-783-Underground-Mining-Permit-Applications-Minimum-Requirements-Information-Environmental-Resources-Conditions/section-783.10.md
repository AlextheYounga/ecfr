##### § 783.10 Information collection. #####

In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501 *et seq.,* the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of this part and assigned it control number 1029-0035. The information is being collected to meet the requirements of sections 507 and 508 of SMCRA, which require that each permit application include a description of the premining environmental resources within and around the proposed permit area. The regulatory authority uses this information as a baseline for evaluating the impacts of mining. You, the permit applicant, must respond to obtain a benefit. A federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Send comments regarding burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Information Collection Clearance Officer, Room 203-SIB, 1951 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20240.
