##### § 783.26 May I submit permit application information in increments as mining progresses? #####

(a) You may request that the regulatory authority approve a schedule for incremental submission of the information required by this part, based on the anticipated progress and impact of underground mining activities.

(b) At its discretion, the regulatory authority may approve the proposed schedule, provided that -

(1) Each increment is clearly defined and includes at least 5 years of anticipated mining.

(2) The schedule includes a map showing the limits of underground mining activity under each increment. You must establish those limits in a manner that will prevent any impact on the succeeding increment before the regulatory authority approves mining within that increment.

(3) The schedule requires that you submit all required data under this part for each successive increment at least one year in advance of any anticipated impact of underground mining upon that increment.

(4) The regulatory authority conditions the permit to -

(i) Require that you reevaluate the adequacy of the PHC determination under § 784.20 of this chapter and the hydrologic reclamation plan under § 784.22 of this chapter as part of each submission under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(ii) Prohibit the conduct of any underground mining activity that might impact an increment before the regulatory authority reviews the information submitted for that increment, updates the CHIA prepared under § 784.21 of this chapter to incorporate that information, and determines that the findings made under § 773.15 of this chapter remain accurate.
