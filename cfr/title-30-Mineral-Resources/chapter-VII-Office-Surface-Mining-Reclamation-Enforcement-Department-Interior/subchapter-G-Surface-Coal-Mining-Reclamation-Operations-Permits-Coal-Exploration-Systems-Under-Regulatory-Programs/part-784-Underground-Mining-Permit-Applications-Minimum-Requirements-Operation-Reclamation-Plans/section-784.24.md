##### § 784.24 What requirements apply to the postmining land use? #####

(a) *What postmining land use information must my application contain*? (1) You must describe and map the proposed use or uses of the land within the proposed permit area following reclamation, based on the categories of land uses listed in the definition of land use in § 701.5 of this chapter.

(2) Except for prime farmland historically used as cropland, you must discuss the utility and capability of the reclaimed land to support the proposed postmining land use and the variety of uses that the land was capable of supporting before any mining, as identified under § 783.22 of this chapter, regardless of the proposed postmining land use.

(3) You must explain how the proposed postmining land use is consistent with existing state and local land use policies and plans.

(4) You must include a copy of the comments concerning the proposed postmining use that you receive from the -

(i) Legal or equitable owner of record of the surface of the proposed permit area; and

(ii) State and local government agencies that would have to initiate, implement, approve, or authorize the proposed use of the land following reclamation.

(5) You must explain how the proposed postmining land use will be achieved and identify any support activities or facilities needed to achieve that use.

(6) If you propose to restore the proposed permit area or a portion thereof to a condition capable of supporting a higher or better use or uses rather than to a condition capable of supporting the uses that the land could support before any mining, you must provide the demonstration required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(b) *What requirements apply to the approval of alternative postmining land uses*? - (1) *Application requirements.* If you propose to restore the proposed permit area or a portion thereof to a condition capable of supporting a higher or better use or uses, rather than to a condition capable of supporting the uses that the land could support before any mining, you must demonstrate that the proposed higher or better use or uses meet the following criteria:

(i) There is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed use or uses will be achieved after mining and reclamation, as documented by, for example, real estate and construction contracts, plans for installation of any necessary infrastructure, procurement of any necessary zoning approvals, landowner commitments, economic forecasts, and studies by land use planning agencies.

(ii) The proposed use or uses do not present any actual or probable hazard to public health or safety or any threat of water diminution or pollution.

(iii) The proposed use or uses will not -

(A) Be impractical or unreasonable.

(B) Be inconsistent with applicable land use policies or plans.

(C) Involve unreasonable delay in implementation.

(D) Cause or contribute to a violation of federal, state, tribal or local law.

(E) Result in changes in the size or frequency of peak flows from the reclaimed area that would cause an increase in flooding when compared with the conditions that would exist if the land were restored to a condition capable of supporting the uses that it was capable of supporting before any mining.

(F) Cause the total volume of flow from the reclaimed area, during every season of the year, to vary in a way that would preclude attainment of any designated use of a surface water located outside the permit area under section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1313(c), or, if there are no designated uses, any premining use of a surface water located outside the permit area.

(G) Cause a change in the temperature or chemical composition of the water that would preclude attainment of any designated use of a surface water under section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1313(c), or, if there are no designated uses, any premining use of a surface water located outside the permit area.

(2) *Regulatory authority decision requirements.* The regulatory authority may approve your request if it -

(i) Consults with the landowner or the land management agency having jurisdiction over the lands to which the use would apply; and

(ii) Finds in writing that you have made the demonstration required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Landowner consent alone is an insufficient basis for this finding.

(c) *What requirements apply to permit revision applications that propose to change the postmining land use*? (1) You may propose to change the postmining land use for all or a portion of the permit area at any time through the permit revision process under § 774.13 of this chapter.

(2) If you propose a higher or better postmining land use, the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section will apply and the application must be considered a significant permit revision for purposes of § 774.13(b)(2) of this chapter.

(d) *What restrictions apply to the retention of mining-related structures*? (1) If you propose to retain mining-related structures other than roads and impoundments for potential future use as part of the postmining land use, you must demonstrate, and the regulatory authority must find in writing, that the size and characteristics of the structures are consistent with and proportional to the needs of the postmining land use.

(2) The amount of bond required for the permit under part 800 of this chapter must include the cost of removing the structure and reclaiming the land upon which it was located to a condition capable of supporting the premining uses. The bond must include the cost of restoring the site to its approximate original contour in accordance with § 817.102 of this chapter and revegetating the site in accordance with the revegetation plan approved under § 784.12(g) of this part for the permit area surrounding the site upon which the structure was previously located.

(3) The reclamation plan submitted under § 784.12 of this part must specify that if a structure is not in use as part of the approved postmining land use by the end of the revegetation responsibility period specified in § 817.115 of this chapter, you must remove the structure and reclaim the land upon which it was located by restoring the approximate original contour in accordance with § 817.102 of this chapter and revegetating the site in accordance with the revegetation plan approved under § 784.12(g) of this part for the permit area surrounding the site upon which the structure was previously located.

(e) *What special provisions apply to previously mined areas*? If land that was previously mined cannot be reclaimed to the land use that existed before any mining because of the previously mined condition, you may propose, and the regulatory authority may approve, any appropriate postmining land use for that land that is both achievable and compatible with land uses in the surrounding area, provided that restoration of the land to that capability does not require disturbance of land previously unaffected by mining.
