You must use current standardized construction cost estimation methods and equipment cost guides or up-to-date actual contracting costs incurred by the regulatory authority for similar activities to prepare this estimate.

(d) *Backfilling and grading plan.* (1) The reclamation plan must contain a plan for backfilling surface excavations, compacting the backfill, and grading the disturbed area, with contour maps, models, or cross-sections that show the anticipated final surface configuration of the proposed permit area, including drainage patterns, in accordance with §§ 817.102 through 817.107 of this chapter, using the best technology currently available.

(2) The backfilling and grading plan must describe in detail how you will conduct backfilling and related reclamation activities, including how you will -

(i) Compact spoil to reduce infiltration to minimize leaching and discharges of parameters of concern.

(ii) Limit compaction of topsoil and soil materials in the root zone to the minimum necessary to achieve stability. The plan also must identify measures that will be used to alleviate soil compaction if necessary.

(e) *Soil handling plan* - (1) *General requirements.* (i) The reclamation plan must include a plan and schedule for removal, storage, and redistribution of topsoil, subsoil, and other material to be used as a final growing medium in accordance with § 817.22 of this chapter. It also must include a plan and schedule for removal, storage, and redistribution or other use of organic matter in accordance with § 817.22(f) of this chapter.

(ii) Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(1)(iii) and (iv) of this section, the plan submitted under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section must require that the B soil horizon, the C soil horizon, and other underlying strata, or portions of those soil horizons and strata, be removed separately, stockpiled if necessary, and redistributed to the extent and in the manner needed to achieve the optimal rooting depths required to restore premining land use capability and to comply with the revegetation requirements of §§ 817.111 and 817.116 of this chapter.

(iii) The plan submitted under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section need not require salvage of those soil horizons which you demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority, are inferior to other overburden materials as a plant growth medium, provided you comply with the soil substitute requirements of paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(iv) The plan submitted under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section may allow blending of the B soil horizon, the C soil horizon, and underlying strata, or portions thereof, to the extent that research or prior experience under similar conditions has demonstrated that blending will not adversely affect soil productivity.

(v) The plan submitted under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section must explain how you will handle and, if necessary, store soil materials to avoid contamination by acid-forming or toxic-forming materials and to minimize deterioration of desirable soil characteristics.

(2) *Substitutes and supplements.* (i) You must identify each soil horizon for which you propose to use appropriate overburden materials as either a supplement to or a substitute for the existing topsoil or subsoil on the proposed permit area.

(B) The use of the overburden materials that you have selected, in combination with or in place of the topsoil or subsoil, will result in a soil medium that is more suitable than the existing topsoil and subsoil to support and sustain vegetation consistent with the postmining land use and the revegetation plan under paragraph (g) of this section and that will provide a rooting depth that is superior to the existing topsoil and subsoil.

(C) The overburden materials that you select for use as a soil substitute or supplement are the best materials available to support and sustain vegetation consistent with the postmining land use and the revegetation plan under paragraph (g) of this section.
