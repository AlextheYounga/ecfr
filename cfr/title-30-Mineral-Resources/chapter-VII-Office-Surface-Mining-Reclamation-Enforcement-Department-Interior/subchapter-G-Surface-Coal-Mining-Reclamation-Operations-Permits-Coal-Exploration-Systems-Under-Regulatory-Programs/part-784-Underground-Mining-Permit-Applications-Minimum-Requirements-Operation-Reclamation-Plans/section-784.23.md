##### § 784.23 What information must I include in plans for the monitoring of groundwater, surface water, and the biological condition of streams during and after mining? #####

(a) *Groundwater monitoring plan* - (1) *General requirements.* Your permit application must include a groundwater monitoring plan adequate to evaluate the impacts of the mining operation on groundwater in the proposed permit and adjacent areas and to determine in a timely manner whether corrective action is needed to prevent the operation from causing material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. The plan must -

(i) Identify the locations to be monitored, the measurements to be taken at each location, and the parameters to be analyzed in samples collected at each location.

(ii) Specify the sampling frequency.

(iii) Establish a sufficient number of appropriate monitoring locations to evaluate the accuracy of the findings in the PHC determination, to identify adverse trends, and to determine, in a timely fashion, whether corrective action is needed to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. At a minimum, the plan must include -

(A) For each aquifer above or immediately below the coal seam to be mined, monitoring sites located upgradient and downgradient of the proposed operation at a distance sufficiently close to the underground mine workings to detect changes as the mining operation progresses. The plan must include a schedule and map for moving these sites as the underground workings advance.

(B) Monitoring wells in any existing underground mine workings that would have a direct hydrological connection to the proposed operation.

(C) At least one monitoring well to be located in the mine pool after mine closure.

(D) Monitoring wells or equivalent monitoring points at the locations specified in the CHIA under § 784.21(b)(6)(vi) of this part.

(iv) Describe how the monitoring data will be used to -

(A) Determine the impacts of the operation upon the hydrologic balance.

(B) Determine the impacts of the operation upon the biology of surface waters within the permit and adjacent areas.

(C) Prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area.

(v) Describe how the water samples will be collected, preserved, stored, transmitted for analysis, and analyzed in accordance with the sampling, analysis, and reporting requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 777.13 of this chapter.

(2) *Parameters* - (i) *General criteria for selection of parameters.* The plan must provide for the monitoring of parameters for which an evaluation threshold under § 784.21(b)(7) of this part exists. It also must provide for the monitoring of other parameters that could be affected by the proposed operation to the extent needed to assess the -

(A) Accuracy of the findings and predictions in the PHC determination prepared under § 784.20 of this part.

(B) Suitability of the quality and quantity of groundwater for protected premining uses of groundwater within the permit and adjacent areas, subject to § 817.40 of this chapter.

(C) Suitability of the quality and quantity of groundwater to support the premining land uses within the permit and adjacent areas.

(3) *Regulatory authority review and action.* (i) Upon completing the technical review of the application, the regulatory authority may require that you revise the plan to increase the frequency of monitoring, to require monitoring of additional parameters, or to require monitoring at additional locations, if the additional requirements would contribute to protection of the hydrologic balance.

(ii) After completing preparation of the cumulative hydrologic impact assessment required under § 784.21 of this part, the regulatory authority must reconsider the adequacy of the monitoring plan and require that you make any necessary changes.

(4) *Exception.* If you can demonstrate, on the basis of the PHC determination prepared under § 784.20 of this part or other available information that a particular aquifer in the proposed permit and adjacent areas has no existing or foreseeable use for agricultural or other human purposes or for fish and wildlife purposes and does not serve as an aquifer that significantly ensures the hydrologic balance within the cumulative impact area, the regulatory authority may waive monitoring of that aquifer.

(b) *Surface-water monitoring plan* - (1) *General requirements.* Your permit application must include a surface-water monitoring plan adequate to evaluate the impacts of the mining operation on surface water in the proposed permit and adjacent areas and to determine in a timely manner whether corrective action is needed to prevent the operation from causing material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. The plan must -

(iii) Specify the sampling frequency.

(iv) Establish a sufficient number of appropriate monitoring locations to evaluate the accuracy of the findings in the PHC determination, to identify adverse trends, and to determine, in a timely fashion, whether corrective action is needed to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. At a minimum, the plan must include -

(A) Monitoring of point-source discharges from the proposed operation.
