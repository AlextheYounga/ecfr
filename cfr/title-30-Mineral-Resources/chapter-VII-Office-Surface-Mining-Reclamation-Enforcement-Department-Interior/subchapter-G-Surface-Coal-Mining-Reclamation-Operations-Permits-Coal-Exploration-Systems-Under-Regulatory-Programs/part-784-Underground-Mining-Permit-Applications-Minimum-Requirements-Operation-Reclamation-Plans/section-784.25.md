##### § 784.25 What information must I provide for siltation structures, impoundments, and refuse piles? #####

(a) *How do I determine the hazard potential of a proposed impoundment*? You must use the following table to identify the hazard potential classification of each proposed impoundment that includes a dam:

|Hazard potential  <br/>classification|Loss of human life in event of failure|Economic, environmental, or lifeline losses<sup>1</sup> in event of failure|
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                 Low                 |            None expected             |   Low potential; generally limited to property owned by the permittee.    |
|             Significant             |            None expected             |                                   Yes.                                    |
|                High                 |  Loss of one or more lives probable  |              Yes, but not necessary for this classification.              |

<sup>1</sup> Lifeline losses refer to disruption of lifeline facilities, which include, but are not limited to, important public utilities, highways, and railroads.

(b) *How must I prepare the general plan for proposed siltation structures, impoundments, and refuse piles*? If you propose to construct a siltation structure, impoundment, or refuse pile, your application must include a general plan that meets the following requirements:

(1) The plan must be prepared by, or under the direction of, and certified by a qualified registered professional engineer, a professional geologist, or, in any state that authorizes land surveyors to prepare and certify such plans, a qualified registered professional land surveyor, with assistance from experts in related fields such as landscape architecture.

(6) The plan must include a schedule setting forth the dates when any detailed design plans for structures that are not submitted with the general plan will be submitted to the regulatory authority.

(c) *How must I prepare the detailed design plan for proposed siltation structures, impoundments, and refuse piles*? - (1) *Detailed design plan requirements for high hazard dams, significant hazard dams, and impounding structures that meet MSHA criteria.* If you propose to construct an impounding structure that would meet the criteria in § 77.216(a) of this title or that would have a significant or high hazard potential under paragraph (a) of this section, you must prepare and submit a detailed design plan that meets the following requirements:

(i) The plan must be prepared by, or under the direction of, a qualified registered professional engineer with assistance from experts in related fields such as geology, land surveying, and landscape architecture. The engineer must certify that the impoundment design meets the requirements of this part, current prudent engineering practices, and any design criteria established by the regulatory authority. The qualified registered professional engineer must be experienced in the design and construction of impoundments.

(ii) The plan must incorporate any design and construction measures identified in the geotechnical investigation report prepared under paragraph (b)(4) of this section as necessary to protect against potential adverse impacts from subsidence resulting from underground mine workings underlying or adjacent to the structure.

(iii) The plan must describe the operation and maintenance requirements for each structure.

(iv) The plan must describe the timetable and plans to remove each structure, if appropriate.

(2) *Detailed design plan requirements for other structures.* If you propose to construct an impounding structure that would not meet the criteria in § 77.216(a) of this title and that would not have a significant or high hazard potential under paragraph (a) of this section, you must prepare and submit a detailed design plan that meets the following requirements:

(i)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the plan must be prepared by, or under the direction of, a qualified, registered, professional engineer, or, in any state that authorizes land surveyors to prepare and certify such plans, a qualified, registered, professional, land surveyor. The engineer or land surveyor must certify that the impoundment design meets the requirements of this part, current prudent engineering practices, and any design criteria established by the regulatory authority. The qualified registered professional engineer or qualified registered professional land surveyor must be experienced in the design and construction of impoundments.

(B) All coal mine waste structures to which §§ 817.81 through 817.84 of this chapter apply must be certified by a qualified, registered, professional engineer.

(ii) The plan must reflect any design and construction requirements for the structure, including any measures identified as necessary in the geotechnical investigation report prepared under paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(iii) The plan must describe the operation and maintenance requirements for each structure.

(iv) The plan must describe the timetable and plans to remove each structure, if appropriate.

(3) Each plan must include stability analyses of the proposed impoundment if the structure would meet the criteria in § 77.216(a) of this title or would have a significant or high hazard potential under paragraph (a) of this section. The stability analyses must address static, seismic, and post-earthquake (liquefaction) conditions. They must include, but are not limited to, strength parameters, pore pressures, and long-term seepage conditions. The plan also must contain a description of each engineering design assumption and calculation with a discussion of each alternative considered in selecting the specific analysis and design parameters and construction methods.

(f) *What additional design requirements apply to coal mine waste impoundments, refuse piles, and impounding structures constructed of coal mine waste?* If you propose to place coal mine waste in a refuse pile or impoundment, or if you plan to use coal mine waste to construct an impounding structure, you must comply with the applicable design requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section.

(iii) Each plan for an impounding structure that will impound coal mine waste or that will be constructed of coal mine waste must contain the results of a geotechnical investigation to determine the structural competence of the foundation that will support the proposed impounding structure and the impounded material. An engineer or engineering geologist must plan and supervise the geotechnical investigation. In planning the investigation, the engineer or geologist must -

(A) Determine the number, location, and depth of borings and test pits using current prudent engineering practice for the size of the impoundment and the impounding structure, the quantity of material to be impounded, and subsurface conditions.

(B) Consider the character of the overburden and bedrock, the proposed abutment sites for the impounding structure, and any adverse geotechnical conditions that may affect the impounding structure.

(C) Identify all springs, seepage, and groundwater flow observed or anticipated during wet periods in the area of the proposed impounding structure on each plan.

(D) Consider the possibility of mudflows, rock-debris falls, or other landslides into the impounding structure, impoundment, or impounded material.

(iv) The design must ensure that at least 90 percent of the water stored in the impoundment during the design precipitation event will be removed within a 10-day period.
