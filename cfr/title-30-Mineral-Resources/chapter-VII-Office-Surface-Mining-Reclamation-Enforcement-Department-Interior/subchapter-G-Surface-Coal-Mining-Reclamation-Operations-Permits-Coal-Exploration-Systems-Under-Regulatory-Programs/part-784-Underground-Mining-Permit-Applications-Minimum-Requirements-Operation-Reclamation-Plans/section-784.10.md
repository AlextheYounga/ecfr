##### ยง 784.10 Information collection. #####

In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3501 *et seq.,* the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved the information collection requirements of this part and assigned it control number 1029-0039. Collection of this information is required under section 516(d) of SMCRA, which in effect requires applicants for permits for underground coal mines to prepare and submit an operation and reclamation plan for coal mining activities as part of the application. The regulatory authority uses this information to determine whether the plan will achieve the reclamation and environmental protection requirements of the Act and regulatory program. You, the permit applicant, must respond to obtain a benefit. A federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number. Send comments regarding burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, Information Collection Clearance Officer, Room 203-SIB, 1951 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20240.
