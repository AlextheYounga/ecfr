##### § 774.10 When must the regulatory authority review a permit after issuance? #####

(a)(1) The regulatory authority must review each permit issued and outstanding under an approved regulatory program during the term of the permit.

(2) The review required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section must include, but is not limited to, an evaluation of the impacts of the operation on fish, wildlife, and related environmental values in the permit and adjacent areas. The regulatory authority must use that evaluation to determine whether it is necessary to order the permittee to modify the fish and wildlife enhancement plan approved in the permit to ensure that the operation minimizes disturbances and adverse impacts on fish, wildlife, and related environmental values within the permit and adjacent areas to the extent possible using the best technology currently available.

(3) The review required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section must occur not later than the middle of each permit term except that permits with a term longer than 5 years must be reviewed no less frequently than the permit midterm or every 5 years, whichever is more frequent.

(4) Permits granted in accordance with § 785.14 of this chapter (mountaintop removal mining) and permits containing a variance from approximate original contour restoration requirements in accordance with § 785.16 of this chapter must be reviewed no later than 3 years from the date of issuance of the permit, unless the permittee affirmatively demonstrates that the proposed development is proceeding in accordance with the terms of the permit. This review may be combined with the first review conducted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section if the permit term does not exceed 5 years.

(5) Permits containing an experimental practice approved in accordance with § 785.13 of this chapter must be reviewed as set forth in the permit or at least every 21/2 years from the date of issuance as required by the regulatory authority, in accordance with § 785.13(g) of this chapter.

(6) Permits granted in accordance with § 785.18 of this chapter (variance for delay in contemporaneous reclamation requirement in combined surface and underground mining operations) must be reviewed no later than 3 years from the date of issuance of the permit. This review may be combined with the first review conducted under paragraph (a)(3) of this section if the permit term does not exceed 5 years.

(b) After a review required by paragraph (a) of this section, or at any time, the regulatory authority may, by order, require reasonable revision of a permit in accordance with § 774.13 to ensure compliance with the Act and the regulatory program.

(c) Any order of the regulatory authority requiring revision of a permit must be based upon written findings and is subject to the provisions for administrative and judicial review in part 775 of this chapter. Copies of the order must be sent to the permittee.

(d) Permits may be suspended or revoked in accordance with subchapter L of this chapter.
