As an alternative to collecting new information, you may submit data and analyses from nearby mining operations if the site of those operations is representative of the proposed operations in terms of topography, hydrology, geology, geochemistry, and method of mining.

(3) The regulatory authority may not approve the permit application until the information identified as necessary in paragraph (f)(1) of this section has been made available to the regulatory authority and the regulatory authority has used that information to prepare the cumulative hydrologic impact assessment required by § 780.21 of this part.
