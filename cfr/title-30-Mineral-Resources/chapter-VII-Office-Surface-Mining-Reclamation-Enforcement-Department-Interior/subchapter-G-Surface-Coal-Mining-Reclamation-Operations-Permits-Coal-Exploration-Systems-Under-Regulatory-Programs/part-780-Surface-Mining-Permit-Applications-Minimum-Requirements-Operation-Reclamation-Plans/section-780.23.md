##### § 780.23 What information must I include in plans for the monitoring of groundwater, surface water, and the biological condition of streams during and after mining? #####

(a) *Groundwater monitoring plan* - (1) *General requirements.* Your permit application must include a groundwater monitoring plan adequate to evaluate the impacts of the mining operation on groundwater in the proposed permit and adjacent areas and to determine in a timely manner whether corrective action is needed to prevent the operation from causing material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. The plan must -

(i) Identify the locations to be monitored, the measurements to be taken at each location, and the parameters to be analyzed in samples collected at each location.

(ii) Specify the sampling frequency.

(iii) Establish a sufficient number of appropriate monitoring locations to evaluate the accuracy of the findings in the PHC determination, to identify adverse trends, and to determine, in a timely fashion, whether corrective action is needed to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. At a minimum, the plan must include -

(A) For each aquifer above or immediately below the lowest coal seam to be mined, monitoring wells or equivalent monitoring points located upgradient and downgradient of the proposed operation.

(B) Monitoring wells placed in backfilled portions of the permit area after backfilling and grading of all or a portion of the permit area is completed, unless you demonstrate, and the regulatory authority finds in writing, that wells in the backfilled area are not necessary to determine or predict the future impact of the mining operation on groundwater quality.

(C) Monitoring wells in any existing underground mine workings that would have a direct hydrologic connection to the proposed operation.
-

(D) Monitoring wells or equivalent monitoring points at the locations specified in the CHIA under § 780.21(b)(6)(iv) of this part.

(3) *Regulatory authority review and action.* (i) Upon completing the technical review of the application, the regulatory authority may require that you revise the plan to increase the frequency of monitoring, to require monitoring of additional parameters, or to require monitoring at additional locations, if the additional requirements would contribute to protection of the hydrologic balance.

(ii) After completing preparation of the cumulative hydrologic impact assessment required under § 780.21 of this part, the regulatory authority must reconsider the adequacy of the monitoring plan and require that you make any necessary changes.

(4) *Exception.* If you can demonstrate, on the basis of the PHC determination prepared under § 780.20 of this part or other available information that a particular aquifer in the proposed permit and adjacent areas has no existing or foreseeable use for agricultural or other human purposes or for fish and wildlife purposes and does not serve as an aquifer that significantly ensures the hydrologic balance within the cumulative impact area, the regulatory authority may waive monitoring of that aquifer.

(b) *Surface-water monitoring plan* - (1) *General requirements.* Your permit application must include a surface-water monitoring plan adequate to evaluate the impacts of the mining operation on surface water in the proposed permit and adjacent areas and to determine in a timely manner whether corrective action is needed to prevent the operation from causing material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area.
