Ephemeral streams include only those conveyances with channels that display both a bed-and-bank configuration and an ordinary high water mark, and that have streambeds located above the water table year-round. Groundwater is not a source of water for streamflow. Runoff from rainfall events and snowmelt is the primary source of water for streamflow.

*Essential hydrologic functions* means the role of an alluvial valley floor in collecting, storing, regulating, and making the natural flow of surface or ground water, or both, usefully available for agricultural activities by reason of the valley floor's topographic position, the landscape, and the physical properties of its underlying materials. A combination of these functions provides a water supply during extended periods of low precipitation.

*Hydrologic regime* means the entire state of water movement in a given area. It is a function of the climate and includes the phenomena by which water first occurs as atmospheric water vapor, passes into a liquid or solid form, falls as precipitation, moves along or into the ground surface, and returns to the atmosphere as vapor by means of evaporation and transpiration.

*Imminent danger to the health and safety of the public* means the existence of any condition or practice, or any violation of a permit or other requirements of the Act in a surface coal mining and reclamation operation, which could reasonably be expected to cause substantial physical harm to persons outside the permit area before the condition, practice, or violation can be abated. A reasonable expectation of death or serious injury before abatement exists if a rational person, subjected to the same condition or practice giving rise to the peril, would avoid exposure to the danger during the time necessary for abatement.

*Impounding structure* means a dam, embankment or other structure used to impound water, slurry, or other liquid or semi-liquid material.

*Impoundments* means all water, sediment, slurry or other liquid or semi-liquid holding structures and depressions, either naturally formed or artificially built.

The term includes, but is not limited to, in situ gasification, in situ leaching, slurry mining, solution mining, borehole mining, and fluid recovery mining.

*Intermittent stream* means a stream or part of a stream that has flowing water during certain times of the year when groundwater provides water for streamflow. The water table is located above the streambed for only part of the year, which means that intermittent streams may not have flowing water during dry periods. Runoff from rainfall events and snowmelt is a supplemental source of water for streamflow. Intermittent streams include only those conveyances with channels that display both a bed-and-bank configuration and an ordinary high water mark.

*Invasive species* means an alien species (a species that is not native to the region or area), the introduction of which has caused or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.
