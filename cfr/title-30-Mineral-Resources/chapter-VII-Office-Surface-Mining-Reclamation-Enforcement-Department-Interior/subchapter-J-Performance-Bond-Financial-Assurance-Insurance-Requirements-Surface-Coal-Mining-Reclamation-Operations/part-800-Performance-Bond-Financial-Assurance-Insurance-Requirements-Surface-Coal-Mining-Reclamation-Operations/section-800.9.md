##### § 800.9 What requirements apply to alternative bonding systems? #####

(a) *Criteria for approval.* OSMRE may approve an alternative bonding system as part of a state or federal regulatory program if the system will achieve the following objectives and purposes of the bonding program:

(1) The alternative must assure that the regulatory authority will have available sufficient money to complete the reclamation plan for any areas which may be in default at any time, except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.

(2) The alternative must provide a substantial economic incentive for the permittee to comply with all reclamation provisions.

(b) *Relationship to other bonding regulations.* (1) The alternative bonding system will apply in lieu of the requirements of §§ 800.12 through 800.23 of this part, with the exception of those provisions of § 800.18 of this part that apply to financial assurances established to guarantee long-term treatment of discharges, to the extent specified in the regulatory program provisions establishing the alternative bonding system and the terms of approval under part 732 of this chapter.

(2) The alternative bonding system must include appropriate conforming modifications to the bond release provisions of §§ 800.40 through 800.44 of this part and the bond forfeiture provisions of § 800.50 of this part.

(c) *Partial alternative bonding systems.* An alternative bonding system may be structured to include only certain phases of mining and reclamation under § 800.42 of this part, provided that the other phases of mining and reclamation are covered by one of the types of bond listed in § 800.12 of this part.

(d) *Discharges that require long-term treatment.* (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (3) of this section, a discharge requiring long-term treatment is not eligible for coverage under an alternative bonding system, other than a financial assurance under § 800.18 of this part, unless the permittee contributes cash in an amount equal to the present value of all costs that the regulatory authority estimates that the alternative bonding system will incur to treat the discharge for as long as the discharge requires active or passive treatment, taking into account the expenses listed in § 800.18(c)(2)(i) through (v) of this part. If the alternative bonding system will receive interest or other earnings on the cash contribution, the regulatory authority may deduct the present value of those estimated earnings from the present value of all estimated expenses when calculating the amount of the required cash contribution.

(2)(i) The regulatory authority must amend an alternative bonding system, other than a financial assurance under § 800.18 of this part, that we approved as part of a regulatory program under subchapter T of this chapter before January 19, 2017 to specify that any permittee responsible for a discharge requiring long-term treatment must make the cash contribution required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the permittee elects to retain coverage of discharge treatment under the alternative bonding system.

(ii) An alternative bonding system, other than a financial assurance under § 800.18 of this part, that we approved as part of a regulatory program under subchapter T of this chapter before January 19, 2017 must continue to provide coverage for long-term treatment of discharges from operations included within the system until we approve the program amendment to which paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section refers and the permittee makes the cash contribution required by the state program counterpart to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless the permittee posts a separate financial assurance, collateral bond, or surety bond to cover that liability.

(iii) An alternative bonding system, other than a financial assurance under § 800.18 of this part, that we approved as part of a regulatory program under subchapter T of this chapter before January 19, 2017 must continue to provide coverage for long-term treatment of discharges from operations included within the system if the permittee does not make the cash contribution required by the state program counterpart to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, unless the permittee posts a separate financial assurance, collateral bond, or surety bond to cover that liability.

(iv) Paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section do not apply to an alternative bonding system that we approved as part of a regulatory program under subchapter T of this chapter if the system that we approved includes an exclusion for coverage of discharges that require long-term treatment.

(3) An alternative bonding system to which paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section apply may elect to provide secondary coverage for long-term treatment of discharges when the permittee posts a financial assurance, collateral bond, or surety bond to cover anticipated treatment costs in lieu of making the cash contribution required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section to retain or obtain primary coverage under the alternative bonding system. The regulatory authority must establish terms and conditions for the secondary coverage.
