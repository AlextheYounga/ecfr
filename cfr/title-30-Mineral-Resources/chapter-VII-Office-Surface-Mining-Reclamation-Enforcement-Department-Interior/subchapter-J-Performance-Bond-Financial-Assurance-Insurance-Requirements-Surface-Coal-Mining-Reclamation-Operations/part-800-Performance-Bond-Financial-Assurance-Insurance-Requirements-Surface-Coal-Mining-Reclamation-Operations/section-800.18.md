##### § 800.18 What special provisions apply to financial guarantees for long-term treatment of discharges? #####

(a) *Applicability.* (1) This section applies to any discharge resulting from surface coal mining operations, underground mining activities, or other activities or facilities regulated under this title whenever both the discharge and the need to treat the discharge continue or may reasonably be expected to continue after the completion of mining, backfilling, grading, and the establishment of revegetation. For purposes of this section, the term *discharge* includes both discharges to surface water and discharges to groundwater.

(2) This section also applies whenever information available to the regulatory authority documents that a discharge of the nature described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section will develop in the future, provided that the quantity and quality of the future discharge can be determined with reasonable probability.

(3) Paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section apply only to discharges that are not anticipated at the time of permit application approval. Those paragraphs do not authorize approval of a permit application for a proposed operation that anticipates creating a discharge for which long-term treatment would be required.

(4) As provided in § 800.18(g) of this part, the regulatory authority must require adjustment of the bond amount whenever it becomes aware of a situation described in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section.

(b) *Acceptable bonding mechanisms.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, you, the permittee, must post a financial assurance, a collateral bond, or a surety bond to guarantee treatment or abatement of discharges requiring long-term treatment.

(2) Operations with discharges in states with an alternative bonding system (other than a financial assurance) approved under subchapter T of this chapter must comply with the requirements of the applicable alternative bonding system.

(c) *Calculation of amount of financial assurance or performance bond.* (1) If you elect to post a financial assurance under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the regulatory authority must calculate the amount of financial assurance required in the manner provided in paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) If you elect to post a collateral bond or surety bond under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the bond amount must be no less than the present value of the funds needed to pay for -

(i) Treatment of the discharge in perpetuity, unless you demonstrate, and the regulatory authority finds, based upon available evidence, that treatment will be needed for a lesser time, either because the discharge will attenuate or because its quality will improve;

(ii) Treatment of the discharge during the time required to forfeit and collect the bond;

(iii) Maintenance, renovation, and replacement of treatment and support facilities as needed;

(iv) Final reclamation of sites upon which treatment facilities are located and areas used in support of those facilities; and

(v) Administrative costs borne by the regulatory authority.

(d) *Requirements for financial assurances.* (1) The trust or annuity must be established in a manner that guarantees that sufficient moneys will be available when needed to pay for -

(i) Treatment of discharges in perpetuity, unless the permittee demonstrates, and the regulatory authority finds, based upon available evidence, that treatment will be needed for a lesser time, either because the discharge will attenuate or because its quality will improve. The regulatory authority may accept arrangements that allow the permittee to build the amount of the trust or annuity over time, provided -

(A) The permittee continues to treat the discharge during that time; and

(B) The regulatory authority retains all performance bonds posted for the permit or permit increment until the trust or annuity reaches a self-sustaining level as determined by the regulatory authority.

(ii) Maintenance, renovation, and replacement of treatment and support facilities as needed.

(iii) Final reclamation of the sites upon which treatment facilities are located and areas used in support of those facilities.

(iv) Administrative costs borne by the regulatory authority or trustee to implement paragraphs (d)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(2) The regulatory authority must require that the investment portfolio held by the trust or annuity prudently account for:

(i) The expected duration of the treatment obligation;

(ii) The need to provide a guarantee of uninterrupted treatment; and

(iii) Whether any other financial guarantee covers a portion of the treatment obligation. If the financial assurance will provide the only financial guarantee of treatment, the regulatory authority must require that the trust or annuity hold a low-risk investment portfolio.

(3) In determining the required amount of the trust or annuity, the regulatory authority must base present value calculations on a conservative anticipated real rate of return on the proposed investments. The rate of return must be net of management or trustee fees.

(4)(i) The trust or annuity must be in a form approved by the regulatory authority and contain all terms and conditions required by the regulatory authority.

(ii) When appropriate, the terms and conditions must include a mechanism whereby the regulatory authority may require the permittee to grant the trustee the real and personal property rights necessary to continue treatment in the event that the permittee ceases treatment. These rights include, but are not limited to, access to and use of the treatment site and ownership of treatment facilities and equipment.

(5) The trust or annuity must irrevocably establish the regulatory authority as the beneficiary of the trust or of the proceeds from the annuity for the purpose of treating mine drainage or other mining-related discharges to protect the environment and users of surface water.

(6) The trust or annuity must provide that disbursement of money from the trust or annuity may be made only upon written authorization of the regulatory authority or according to a schedule established in the agreement accompanying the trust or annuity.

(7) A financial institution or company serving as a trustee or issuing an annuity must be one of the following:

(i) A national bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

(ii) An operating subsidiary of a national bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.

(iii) A bank or trust company chartered by the state in which the operation is located.

(iv) An insurance company licensed or authorized to do business in the state in which the operation is located or designated by the pertinent regulatory body of that state as an eligible surplus lines insurer.

(v) Any other financial institution or company authorized to do business in the state in which the operation is located, provided that -

(A) The institution's or company's activities are examined or regulated by a state or federal agency; and

(B) The institution or company has trust powers satisfactory to the regulatory authority.

(8) The regulatory authority may allow a not-for-profit organization under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code to serve as a trustee if -

(i) The organization maintains appropriate professional liability insurance coverage; and

(ii) The regulatory authority determines that the organization has demonstrated the financial and technical capability to manage trusts and assume day-to-day operation of the trust and treatment facility in the event of a default.

(9) The permittee or the regulatory authority must procure a new trustee when the trustee's administration of the trust or annuity is unsatisfactory to the regulatory authority.

(e) *Termination of a financial assurance instrument.* Termination of a trust or annuity may occur only as specified by the regulatory authority upon a determination that one of the following situations exists -

(1) No further treatment or other reclamation measures are necessary, in which case paragraph (h) of this section will apply.

(2) A satisfactory replacement financial assurance or bond has been posted in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

(3) The terms of the trust or annuity establish conditions for termination and those conditions have been met.

(f) *Regulatory authority review and adjustment of amount of financial assurance.* (1) The regulatory authority must establish a schedule for reviewing the performance of the trustee, the adequacy of the trust or annuity, and the accuracy of the assumptions upon which the trust or annuity is based. This review must occur on at least an annual basis.

(2) The regulatory authority must require that the permittee provide additional resources to the trust or annuity whenever the review conducted under paragraph (f)(1) of this section or any other information available to the regulatory authority at any time demonstrates that the financial assurance is no longer adequate to meet the purpose for which it was established.

(g) *Replacement of financial assurance.* With the approval of the regulatory authority, a financial assurance may be replaced in accordance with the provisions of § 800.30(a) of this part.

(h) *Release of liability.* Release of reclamation liabilities and obligations under a financial assurance is subject to the applicable bond release provisions of §§ 800.40 through 800.44 of this part.

(i) *Effect of financial assurance on release of bond.* The permittee may apply for, and the regulatory authority may approve, release of any bonds posted for the permit or, if the permittee uses incremental bonding, the permit increment for which the regulatory authority has approved a financial assurance under this section, provided that the permittee and the regulatory authority comply with the bond release requirements and procedures in §§ 800.40 through 800.44 of this part. This provision applies only if the following conditions exist -

(1) The financial assurance is both in place and fully funded.

(2) The permit or permit increment fully meets all applicable reclamation requirements, with the exception of the discharge and the presence of associated treatment and support facilities.

(3) The financial assurance will serve as the bond for reclamation of the portion of the permit area required for postmining water treatment facilities and access to those facilities.
