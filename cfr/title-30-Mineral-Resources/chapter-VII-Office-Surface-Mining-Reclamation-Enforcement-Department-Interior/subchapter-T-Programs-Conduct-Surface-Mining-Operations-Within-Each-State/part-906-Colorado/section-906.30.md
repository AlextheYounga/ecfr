8. The MLRD shall assume primary responsibility pursuant to sections 510(a) and 523(c) of the Act for the analysis, review, and approval of the permit application or application for a permit revision or renewal according to the standards of the approved Program. The Director shall assist the MLRD in the analysis of the permit application or application for a permit revision or renewal and coordinate with the other appropriate Federal agencies as specified by the Secretary according to the procedures set forth in appendix B. The Department shall concurrently carry out its responsibilities which cannot be delegated to the State under the MLA, National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), and other public laws (including, but not limited to, those in appendix A) according to the procedures set forth in appendix B so as, to the maximum extent possible, not to duplicate the responsibilities of the State as set forth in this Agreement and the Program. The Secretary shall consider the information submitted in the permit application package and, when appropriate, make the decisions required by the Act, MLA, NEPA and other public laws as described above.

9. As a matter of practice the Department will not independently initiate contacts with the applicant regarding permit application packages or applications for permit revisions or renewals. However, the Department reserves the right to act independently of the MLRD to carry out its statutory responsibilities under the Act, MLA, NEPA and other public laws provided, however, that the Department shall send copies of all relevant correspondence to the MLRD.

12. To the fullest extent allowed by State and Federal law, the Director and MLRD shall cooperate so that duplication will be eliminated in conducting the review and analysis of the permit application package or application for a permit revision or renewal.

Article VII: Inspections

13. The MLRD shall conduct inspections on Federal lands and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the Program.

14. The MLRD shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection, and on a timely basis, file with the Director a copy of each inspection report. Such report shall adequately describe (1) the general conditions of the lands under the permit; (2) the manner in which the operations are being conducted; and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance and reclamation requirements.

15. The MLRD will be the point of contact and primary inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with the requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described hereinafter. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Federal inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement. The Department may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 842 and 743, as part 743 relates to obligations under laws other than the Act.

16. OSM shall ordinarily give the MLRD reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection under 30 CFR 842.11 in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint of an imminent danger to the public health and safety or significant, imminent environmental harm to land, air or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1(ii)(C), it will contact MLRD no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger shall be referred to MLRD for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to MLRD to carry out his responsibilities under the Federal Act.

Article VIII: Enforcement

17. MLRD shall be the primary enforcement authority under the Act concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the Program. Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under other laws and orders including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A is reserved to the Secretary.

18. During any joint inspection by OSM and MLRD, MLRD shall have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of orders of cessation, notices of violation, and assessment of penalties. The MLRD shall consult OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend or revoke a permit.

19. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where the MLRD and OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR parts 843 and 845. Such enforcement action shall be based on the performance standards included in the regulations of the approved Program, and shall be taken using the procedures and penalty system contained in 30 CFR parts 843 and 845.

20. The MLRD and the Department shall promptly notify each other of all violations of applicable laws, regulations, orders, or approved mining permits subject to this Agreement and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.

21. Personnel of the State and representatives of the Department shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.

22. This Agreement does not limit the Department's authority to enforce violations of Federal law which establish standards and requirements which are authorized by laws other than the Act.

Article IX: Bonds

23. For all surface coal mining operations on Federal lands, the MLRD and the Secretary shall require each operator to submit a single performance bond payable to the State and to the United States, if required by Federal regulations, to cover the operator's responsibilities under the Act and the Program. Such performance bond shall be conditioned upon compliance with all requirements of the Act, the Program and any other requirements imposed by the Department under the MLA, as amended. If the Agreement is terminated, all bonds will revert to being payable only to the United States to the extent that Federal lands are involved. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for a Federal lease bond required by 30 CFR subpart3473 or a lessee protection bond required in addition to a performance bond, in certain circumstances, by section 715 of the Act.

24. Prior to releasing the operator from an obligation under a performance bond required by the Program, the MLRD shall obtain the concurrence of OSM. the MLRD shall also advise OSM of annual adjustments to the performance bond, pursuant to the Program. Departmental concurrence shall include coordination with other Federal agencies having authority over the lands involved.

25. The operator's performance bond shall be subject to forfeiture with the consent of OSM, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Program.

Article X: Designating Land Areas Unsuitable for All or Certain Types of Surface Coal Mining Operations

26. The MLRD and the Director shall cooperate with each other in the review and processing of petitions to designate lands as unsuitable for surface coal mining operations. When either agency receives a petition that could impact adjacent Federal and non-Federal lands, respectively, the agency receiving the petition shall (1) notify the other of receipt and of the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision; and (2) request and fully consider data, information and views of the other.

The authority to designate State and private lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the State. The authority to designate Federal lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the Secretary or his designated representative.
