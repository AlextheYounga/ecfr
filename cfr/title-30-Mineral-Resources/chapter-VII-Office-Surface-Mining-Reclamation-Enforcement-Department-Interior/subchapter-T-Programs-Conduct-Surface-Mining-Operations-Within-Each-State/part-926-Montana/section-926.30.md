A. DEQ shall conduct inspections on Federal lands in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and prepare and file inspection reports in accordance with the approved State Program.

B. DEQ shall, subsequent to conducting any inspection on Federal lands, file with OSM's appropriate Field Office an inspection report describing: (1) the general conditions of the lands under the lease, permit, or license; (2) the manner in which the operations are being conducted; and (3) whether the operator is complying with applicable performance standards and reclamation requirements.

C. DEQ will be the point of contact and inspection authority in dealing with the operator concerning operations and compliance with requirements covered by this Agreement, except as described in this Agreement and in the Secretary's regulations. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent inspections by authorized Federal or State agencies for purposes other than those covered by this Agreement.

D. Authorized representatives of the Secretary may conduct any inspections necessary to comply with 30 CFR Parts 842 and 843, and with the Secretary's obligations under laws other than SMCRA.

E. OSM shall give DEQ reasonable notice of its intent to conduct an inspection in order to provide State inspectors with an opportunity to join in the inspection. When OSM is responding to a citizen complaint supplying adequate proof of an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or a significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, pursuant to 30 CFR 842.11(b)(1)(ii)(C), it shall contact DEQ no less than 24 hours prior to the Federal inspection, if practicable, to facilitate a joint Federal/State inspection. All citizen complaints which do not involve an imminent danger to the public health and safety, or a significant imminent environmental harm to land, air, or water resources, must be referred initially to DEQ for action. The Secretary reserves the right to conduct inspections without prior notice to DEQ, if necessary, to carry out his responsibilities under SMCRA.

Article VIII: Enforcement

A. DEQ shall have primary enforcement authority under SMCRA concerning compliance with the requirements of this Agreement and the State Program in accordance with 30 CFR 740.4(c)(5) and 740.17(a)(2). Enforcement authority given to the Secretary under SMCRA, and its implementing regulations, or other Federal laws and Executive Orders, including, but not limited to, those listed in appendix A, is reserved to the Secretary.

B. During any joint inspection by OSM and DEQ, DEQ will have primary responsibility for enforcement procedures, including issuance of cessation orders and notices of violation. DEQ shall consult with OSM prior to issuance of any decision to suspend, rescind or revoke a permit on Federal lands. DEQ shall notify BLM of any suspension, rescission or revocation of a permit containing leased Federal coal pursuant to 30 CFR 740.13(f)(2).

C. During any inspection made solely by OSM or any joint inspection where DEQ an OSM fail to agree regarding the propriety of any particular enforcement action, OSM may take any enforcement action necessary to comply with 30 CFR Parts 842, 843, 845 and 846.

D. DEQ and OSM shall promptly notify each other of all violations and of all actions taken with respect to such violations.

E. Personnel of DEQ and OSM shall be mutually available to serve as witnesses in enforcement actions taken by either party.

F. This Agreement does not affect or limit the Secretary's authority to enforce violations of Federal laws other than SMCRA.

Article IX: Bonds

A. DEQ and the Secretary shall require all operators on Federal lands to submit a single performance bond jointly payable to both the United States and DEQ. The board shall be of sufficient amount to cover the operator's responsibilities under SMCRA and the State Program. The bond shall be conditioned upon continued compliance with all requirements of SMCRA, 30 CFR Chapter VII, the State Program, and the permit. Such bond shall provide that if this Agreement is terminated under the provisions of 30 CFR 745.15, the portion of the bond covering the Federal lands shall be payable only to the United States.

B. DEQ will have primary responsibility for the approval and release of performance bonds required for surface coal mining and reclamation operations on Federal lands. However, release of a performance bond on lands subject to an approved mining plan requires the concurrence of OSM as provided in 30 CFR 740.15(d)(3). Prior to such concurrence, OSM shall coordinate with other Federal agencies having the authority over the lands involved. DEQ shall annually advice OSM of adjustments to the performance bond.

C. Performance bonds will be subject to forfeiture with the concurrence of OSM, in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the State Program. OSM may not withhold its concurrence unless DEQ's forfeiture decision is not in accordance with the requirements and procedures of the State program.

D. Submission of a performance bond does not satisfy the requirements for either a Federal lease bond required by 43 CFR part 3474 or a lessee protection bond which is required in certain circumstances by section 715 of SMCRA.

1. Authority to designate or terminate the designation of areas of Federal lands as unsuitable for mining is reserved to the Secretary. Unsuitability petitions shall be filed with OSM and would be processed in accordance with 30 CFR 769.

2. When either DEQ or OSM receives a petition that could impact adjacent Federal or non-Federal lands pursuant to section 522(c) of SMCRA, the agency receiving the petition will notify the other of receipt of the petition and the anticipated schedule for reaching a decision. OSM shall coordinate with and solicit comments from the applicable Federal land management agency. OSM and DEQ shall fully consider data, information, and recommendations of all agencies.

B. Valid Existing Rights (VER) and Compatibility Determinations

The following actions will be taken when requests for determinations of VER pursuant to section 522(e) of SMCRA, or for determinations of compatibility pursuant to section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA are received:

1. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any areas specified under section 522(e)(1) of SMCRA, the Secretary will make the VER determination. If surface coal mining and reclamation operations would be conducted on both Federal and non-Federal lands within such areas, the Secretary will make the VER determination for the Federal lands and DEQ will make the VER determination for State and private lands.

2. For Federal lands within the boundaries of any national forest where proposed surface coal mining and reclamation operations are prohibited or limited by section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 761.11(b), the Secretary will make VER determinations. OSM will process requests for determinations of compatibility under section 522(e)(2) of SMCRA and part 30 CFR 761.12(c).

3. Where a VER determination is requested for Federal lands protected under section 522(e)(3), DEQ will make the VER determination. DEQ will determine, in consultation with the State Historic Preservation Officer, whether any proposed operation will adversely affect any publicly-owned park or historic place listed on the National Register of Historic Sites (NRHS).

Surface coal mining and reclamation operations of Federal lands protected under section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA may be permitted if approved jointly by DEQ, and the Federal, State, or local agency with jurisdiction over the park or historic place. DEQ will coordinate with any agency with jurisdiction over the publicly-owned park or historic place to develop mutually acceptable terms and conditions for incorporation into the permit in order to mitigate environmental impacts.

4. DEQ will process determinations of VER on Federal lands for all areas limited or prohibited by section 522(e)(4) and (5) of SMCRA as unsuitable for mining.

5. For operations on Federal lands, whenever DEQ is responsible for making the VER determinations, DEQ will consult with OSM and any affected agency.
