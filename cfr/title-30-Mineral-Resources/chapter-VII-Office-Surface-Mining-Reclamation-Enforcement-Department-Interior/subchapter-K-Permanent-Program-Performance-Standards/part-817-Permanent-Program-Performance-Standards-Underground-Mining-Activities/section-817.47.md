##### ยง 817.47 What requirements apply to discharge structures for impoundments? #####

You must control discharges from sedimentation ponds, permanent and temporary impoundments, coal mine waste impounding structures, and diversions by energy dissipators, riprap channels, and other devices when necessary to reduce erosion, to prevent deepening or enlargement of stream channels, to control meander migration, or to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance. You must design discharge structures according to standard engineering design procedures.
