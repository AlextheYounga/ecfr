##### ยง 817.13 What special requirements apply to drilled holes, wells, and exposed underground openings? #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, you must case, line, otherwise manage each exploration hole, drilled hole, borehole, shaft, well, or other exposed underground opening in a manner approved by the regulatory authority to -

(1) Prevent acid or other toxic drainage from entering groundwater and surface water.

(2) Minimize disturbance to the prevailing hydrologic balance.

(3) Ensure the safety of people, livestock, fish and wildlife, and machinery in the permit area and the adjacent area.

(b) You must prevent access to each temporarily inactive mine entry by constructing fences and barricades or other covering devices and posting signs that identify the hazardous nature of the opening. You must periodically inspect and maintain these fences and barricades in good operating condition.

(c) You must temporarily seal each exploration hole, drilled hole, borehole, shaft, well, or other exposed underground opening that the approved permit identifies for use to monitor groundwater or to return underground development waste, coal processing waste, or water to underground workings until you are ready to actually use the hole or opening for that purpose.

(d) You may retain a drilled hole or groundwater monitoring well for use as a water well under the conditions established in ยง 817.39 of this part.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, you must permanently close each exploration hole, drilled hole, borehole, well, or underground opening that mining activities uncover or expose within the permit area, unless the regulatory authority -

(1) Approves use of the hole, well, or opening for water monitoring purposes; or

(2) Authorizes other management of the hole or well.

(f)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, you must cap, seal, backfill, or otherwise properly manage each shaft, drift, adit, tunnel, exploratory hole, entryway or other opening to the surface when no longer needed for monitoring or any other use that the regulatory authority approves after finding that the use would not adversely affect the environment or public health and safety.

(2) Permanent closure measures taken under paragraph (f)(1) of this section must be -

(i) Consistent with ยง 75.1771 of this title;

(ii) Designed to prevent access to the mine workings by people, livestock, fish and wildlife, and machinery; and

(iii) Designed to keep acid or toxic mine drainage from entering groundwater or surface water.

(g) The requirements of this section do not apply to holes drilled and used for blasting as part of surface operations.
