##### ยง 817.115 How long am I responsible for revegetation after planting? #####

(a) *General provisions.* (1) The period of extended responsibility for successful revegetation will begin after the last year of augmented seeding, fertilizing, irrigation, or other work, excluding husbandry practices that are approved by the regulatory authority in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(2) The initial planting of small areas that are regraded and planted as a result of the removal of sediment control structures and associated structures and facilities, including ancillary roads used to access those structures, need not be considered an augmented seeding necessitating an extended or separate revegetation responsibility period. This paragraph also applies to areas upon which accumulated sediment and materials resulting from removal of sedimentation pond embankments are spread.

(b) *Areas of more than 26.0 inches of average annual precipitation.* In areas of more than 26.0 inches of annual average precipitation, the period of responsibility will continue for a period of not less than -

(1) Five full years, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(i) The vegetation parameters for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland must equal or exceed the approved success standard during the growing season of any 2 years of the responsibility period, except the first year.

(ii) On all other areas, the parameters must equal or exceed the applicable success standard during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.

(2) Two full years for lands eligible for remining included in a permit approved under ยง 785.25 of this chapter. The lands must equal or exceed the applicable ground cover standard during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.

(c) *Areas of 26.0 inches or less average annual precipitation.* In areas of 26.0 inches or less average annual precipitation, the period of responsibility will continue for a period of not less than:

(1) Ten full years, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

(i) The vegetation parameters for grazing land, pasture land, or cropland must equal or exceed the approved success standard during the growing season of any two years after year six of the responsibility period.

(ii) On all other areas, the parameters must equal or exceed the applicable success standard during the growing season of the last year of the responsibility period.

(2) Five full years for lands eligible for remining included in a permit approved under ยง 785.25 of this chapter. The lands must equal or exceed the applicable ground cover standard during the growing seasons of the last two consecutive years of the responsibility period.

(d) *Normal husbandry practices.* (1) The regulatory authority may approve selective husbandry practices, excluding augmented seeding, fertilization, or irrigation, provided it obtains prior approval from OSMRE in accordance with ยง 732.17 of this chapter that the practices are normal husbandry practices, without extending the period of responsibility for revegetation success and bond liability, if those practices can be expected to continue as part of the postmining land use or if discontinuance of the practices after the liability period expires will not reduce the probability of permanent revegetation success.

(2) Approved practices must be normal husbandry practices within the region for unmined lands having land uses similar to the approved postmining land use of the disturbed area, including such practices as disease, pest, and vermin control; and any pruning, reseeding, and transplanting specifically necessitated by such actions.
