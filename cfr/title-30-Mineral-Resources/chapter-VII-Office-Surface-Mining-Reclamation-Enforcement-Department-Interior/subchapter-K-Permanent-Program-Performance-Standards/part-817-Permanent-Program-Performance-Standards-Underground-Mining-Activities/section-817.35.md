(2) At a minimum, you must conduct monitoring through mining, reclamation, and the revegetation responsibility period under § 817.115 of this part for the monitored area. Monitoring must continue beyond that minimum for any additional time needed for monitoring results to demonstrate that the criteria of § 817.35(d)(1) and (2) of this section have been met, as determined by the regulatory authority.

(b)(1) You must submit groundwater monitoring data to the regulatory authority every 3 months, or more frequently if prescribed by the regulatory authority.

(2) Monitoring reports must include analytical results from each sample taken during the reporting period.

(c) When the analysis of any sample indicates noncompliance with the terms and conditions of the permit, you must promptly notify the regulatory authority, take any applicable actions required under § 773.17(e) of this chapter, and implement any applicable remedial measures required by the hydrologic reclamation plan approved in the permit in accordance with § 784.22 of this chapter.

(d) You may use the permit revision procedures of § 774.13 of this chapter to request that the regulatory authority modify the groundwater monitoring requirements, including the parameters covered and the sampling frequency. The regulatory authority may approve your request if you demonstrate, using the monitoring data obtained under this section, that -

(1) Future adverse changes in groundwater quantity or quality are unlikely to occur.

(2) The operation has -

(i) Minimized disturbance to the hydrologic balance in the permit and adjacent areas.

(ii) Prevented material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area.

(iii) Preserved or restored the biological condition of perennial and intermittent streams within the permit and adjacent areas for which baseline biological condition data was collected under § 784.19(c)(6)(vi) of this chapter when groundwater from the permit area provides all or part of the base flow of those streams.

(iv) Maintained or restored the availability and quality of groundwater to the extent necessary to support the approved postmining land uses within the permit area.

(v) Protected or replaced the water rights of other users.

(e) Whenever information available to the regulatory authority indicates that additional monitoring is necessary to protect the hydrologic balance, to detect hydrologic changes, or to meet other requirements of the regulatory program, the regulatory authority must issue an order under § 774.10(b) of this chapter requiring that you revise your permit to include the necessary additional monitoring.

(f) You must install, maintain, operate, and, when no longer needed, remove all equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction with monitoring groundwater, consistent with §§ 817.13 and 817.39 of this part.
