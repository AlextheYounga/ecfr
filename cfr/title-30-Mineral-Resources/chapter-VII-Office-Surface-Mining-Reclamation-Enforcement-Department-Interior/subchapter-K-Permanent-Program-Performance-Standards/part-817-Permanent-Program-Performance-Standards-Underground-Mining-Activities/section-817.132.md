##### ยง 817.132 What actions must I take when I permanently cease mining operations? #####

(a) Persons who permanently cease conducting underground mining activities at a particular site must close, backfill, or otherwise permanently reclaim all disturbed areas in accordance with this chapter and the permit approved by the regulatory authority.
