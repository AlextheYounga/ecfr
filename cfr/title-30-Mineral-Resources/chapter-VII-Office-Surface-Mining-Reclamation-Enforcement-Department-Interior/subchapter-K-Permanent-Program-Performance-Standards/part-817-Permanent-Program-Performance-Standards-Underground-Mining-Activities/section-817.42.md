##### ยง 817.42 What Clean Water Act requirements apply to discharges from my operation? #####

(a) Nothing in this section, nor any action taken pursuant to this section, supersedes or modifies -

(1) The authority or jurisdiction of federal, state, or tribal agencies responsible for administration, implementation, and enforcement of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 *et seq.;* or

(2) The decisions that those agencies make under the authority of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 *et seq.,* including decisions on whether a particular set of facts constitutes a violation of the Clean Water Act.

(b) Discharges of water from underground mining activities and from areas disturbed by underground mining activities must -

(1) Be made in compliance with all applicable water quality laws and regulations, including the effluent limitations established in the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for the operation under section 402 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1342, or its state or tribal counterpart. The regulatory authority must notify the appropriate Clean Water Act authority whenever it takes action to enforce a permit condition required by ยง 773.17(i) of this chapter with respect to an effluent limitation in a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. The regulatory authority must initiate coordination with the Clean Water Act authority before taking enforcement action if coordination is needed to determine whether a violation of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit exists.

(2) Not cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards established under the authority of section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1313(c), or other applicable state or tribal water quality standards.

(c) Discharges of overburden, coal mine waste, and other materials into waters subject to the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 *et seq.,* must be made in compliance with section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1344, and its implementing regulations.

(f)(1) You must remove precipitates and otherwise maintain all water treatment facilities requiring the use of settling ponds or lagoons as necessary to maintain the functionality of those facilities.

(2) You must dispose of all precipitates removed from facilities under paragraph (f)(1) of this section either in an approved solid waste landfill or within the permit area in accordance with a plan approved by the regulatory authority.

(g) You must operate and maintain water treatment facilities until the regulatory authority authorizes removal based upon monitoring data demonstrating that influent to the facilities meets all applicable effluent limitations without treatment and that discharges would not cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards established under the authority of section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1313(c), or other applicable state or tribal water quality standards if left untreated.
