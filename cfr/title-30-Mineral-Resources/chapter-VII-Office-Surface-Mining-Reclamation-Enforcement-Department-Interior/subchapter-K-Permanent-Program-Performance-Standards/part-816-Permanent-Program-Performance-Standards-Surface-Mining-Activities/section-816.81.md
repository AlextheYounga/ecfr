##### § 816.81 How must I dispose of coal mine waste? #####

(a) *General requirements.* If you, the permittee, intend to dispose of coal mine waste in an area other than the mine workings or excavations, you must place the waste in new or existing disposal areas within a permit area in accordance with this section and, as applicable, §§ 816.83 and 816.84 of this part.

(b) *Basic performance standards.* You must haul or convey and place the coal mine waste in a controlled manner to -

(1) Minimize the adverse effects of leachate and surface-water runoff on groundwater and surface water, including aquatic life, within the permit and adjacent areas to the extent possible, using the best technology currently available.

(2) Ensure mass stability and prevent mass movement during and after construction.

(3) Ensure that the final disposal facility is suitable for revegetation, compatible with the natural surroundings, and consistent with the approved postmining land use.

(4) Not create a public hazard.

(5) Prevent combustion.

(6) Ensure that the disposal facility will not change the size or frequency of peak flows from precipitation events or thaws in a way that would result in an increase in flooding when compared with the impacts of premining peak flows.

(7) Ensure that the disposal facility will not cause or contribute to a violation of applicable state or tribal groundwater standards or preclude any premining use of groundwater.

(8) Ensure that the disposal facility will not cause or contribute to a violation of applicable state or tribal water quality standards for surface water located downstream of the toe of the fill, including, but not limited to, water quality standards established under the authority of section 303(c) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1313(c).

(9) Ensure that the disposal facility will not discharge acid or toxic mine drainage.

(c) *Coal mine waste from outside the permit area.* You may dispose of coal mine waste materials from activities located outside the permit area within the permit area only if approved by the regulatory authority. Approval must be based upon a showing that disposal will be in accordance with the standards of this section.

(d) *Design and construction requirements.* (1)(i) You must design and construct coal mine waste disposal facilities using current, prudent engineering practices and any design or construction criteria established by the regulatory authority.

(ii) A qualified registered professional engineer, experienced in the design and construction of similar earth and waste structures, must certify the design of the disposal facility. The engineer must specifically certify that any existing and planned underground mine workings in the vicinity of the disposal facility will not adversely impact the stability of the structure.

(iii) You must construct the disposal facility in accordance with the design and plans submitted under § 780.25 of this chapter and approved in the permit. A qualified registered professional engineer experienced in the design and construction of similar earth and waste structures must certify that the facility has been constructed in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.

(2) You must design and construct the disposal facility to attain a minimum long-term static safety factor of 1.5. The foundation and abutments must be stable under all conditions of construction.

(e) *Foundation investigations.* You must perform sufficient foundation and abutment investigations, as well as any necessary laboratory testing of foundation material, to determine the design requirements for foundation stability and control of underseepage. The analyses of the foundation conditions must take into consideration the effect of any underground mine workings located in the permit and adjacent areas upon the stability of the disposal facility.

(f) *Soil handling requirements.* You must remove all vegetation, other organic matter, and soil materials from the disposal area prior to placement of the coal mine waste. You must store, redistribute, or otherwise use those materials in accordance with § 816.22 of this part. You may use soil substitutes and supplements if approved in the permit in accordance with § 780.12(e) of this chapter.

(g) *Emergency procedures.* (1) If any examination or inspection discloses that a potential hazard exists, you must inform the regulatory authority promptly of the finding and of the emergency procedures formulated for public protection and remedial action.

(2) If adequate procedures cannot be formulated or implemented, you must notify the regulatory authority immediately. The regulatory authority then must notify the appropriate agencies that other emergency procedures are required to protect the public.

(h) *Underground disposal.* You may dispose of coal mine waste in underground mine workings only in accordance with a plan approved by the regulatory authority and the Mine Safety and Health Administration under § 784.26 of this chapter.
