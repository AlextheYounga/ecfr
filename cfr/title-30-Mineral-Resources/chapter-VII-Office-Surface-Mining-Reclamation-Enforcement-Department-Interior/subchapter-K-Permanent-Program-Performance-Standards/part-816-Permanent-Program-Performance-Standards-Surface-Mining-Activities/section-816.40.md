##### ยง 816.40 What responsibility do I have to replace water supplies? #####

(a) *Replacement of adversely-impacted water supplies.* (1) You, the permittee, must replace the water supply of an owner of an interest in real property who obtains all or part of his or her supply of water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, or other legitimate use from an underground or surface source when the water supply has been adversely impacted by contamination, diminution, or interruption as a result of your surface mining activities.

(2) The replacement supply must be equivalent to the quantity and quality of the premining supply.

(3) Replacement includes provision of an equivalent water supply delivery system and payment of operation and maintenance expenses in excess of customary and reasonable delivery costs for the premining water supply. If you and the water supply owner agree, your obligation to pay operation and maintenance costs may be satisfied by a one-time payment in an amount that covers the present worth of the increased annual operation and maintenance costs for a period upon which you and the water supply owner agree.

(4) If the affected water supply was not needed for the land use in existence at the time of loss, contamination, or diminution, and if the supply is not needed to achieve the postmining land use, you may satisfy the replacement requirements by demonstrating that a suitable alternative water source is available and could feasibly be developed, provided you obtain written concurrence from the owner of the affected water supply.

(b) *Measures to address anticipated adverse impacts to protected water supplies.* For anticipated loss of or damage to a protected water supply, you must adhere to the requirements set forth in the permit in accordance with ยง 780.22(b) of this chapter.

(c) *Measures to address unanticipated adverse impacts to protected water supplies.* For unanticipated loss of or damage to a protected water supply, you must -

(1) Provide an emergency temporary water supply within 24 hours of notification of the loss. The temporary supply must be adequate in quantity and quality to meet normal household needs.

(2) Develop and submit a plan for a permanent replacement supply to the regulatory authority within 30 days of receiving notice that an unanticipated loss of or damage to a protected water supply has occurred.

(3) Provide a permanent replacement water supply within 2 years of the date of receiving notice of an unanticipated loss of or damage to a protected water supply. The regulatory authority may grant an extension if you have made a good-faith effort to meet this deadline, but have been unable to do so for reasons beyond your control.

(d) *Basis for determination of adverse impact.* The regulatory authority must use the baseline hydrologic and geologic information required under ยง 780.19 of this chapter and all other available information to determine whether and to what extent the mining operation adversely impacted the damaged water supply.
