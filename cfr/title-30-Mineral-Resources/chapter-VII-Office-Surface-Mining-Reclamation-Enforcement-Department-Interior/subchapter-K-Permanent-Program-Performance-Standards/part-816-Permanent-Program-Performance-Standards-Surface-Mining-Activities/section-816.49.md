(4) *Foundation.* (i) Foundations and abutments for an impounding structure must be stable during all phases of construction and operation and must be designed based on adequate and accurate information on the foundation and abutment conditions.

(ii) You must conduct foundation and abutment investigations, as well as any necessary laboratory testing of foundation material, to determine the design requirements for foundation stability and control of underseepage for an impoundment that includes a dam with a significant or high hazard potential classification under § 780.25(a) of this chapter.

(iii) You must remove all vegetative and organic materials from the foundation area and excavate and prepare the foundation area to resist failure. You must install cutoff trenches if necessary to ensure stability.

(5) *Protection of impoundment slopes.* You must take measures to protect impoundment slopes from surface erosion and the adverse impacts of a sudden drawdown.

(6) *Protection of embankment faces.* Faces of embankments and surrounding areas shall be vegetated, except that faces where water is impounded may be riprapped or otherwise stabilized in accordance with accepted design practices.

(7) *Spillways.* An impoundment must include either a combination of principal and emergency spillways or a single spillway configured as specified in paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, designed and constructed to safely pass the applicable design precipitation event specified in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section, except as set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

(i) The regulatory authority may approve a single open-channel spillway that is:

(A) Of nonerodible construction and designed to carry sustained flows; or

(B) Earth- or grass-lined and designed to carry short-term, infrequent flows at non-erosive velocities where sustained flows are not expected.

(ii) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the required design precipitation event for an impoundment meeting the spillway requirements of paragraph (a)(7) of this section is:

(A) For an impoundment that includes a dam with a significant or high hazard potential classification under § 780.25(a) of this chapter, the design precipitation event specified in the auxiliary spillway hydrograph column in the table in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, or any greater event specified by the regulatory authority.

(B) For an impoundment meeting the criteria of § 77.216(a) of this title, the 100-year, 6-hour event, or any greater event specified by the regulatory authority.

(C) For an impoundment not included in paragraphs (a)(7)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, the 25-year, 6-hour event, or any greater event specified by the regulatory authority.

(8) *Highwalls.* The vertical portion of any highwall remnant within the impoundment must be located far enough below the low-water line along the full extent of the highwall to provide adequate safety and access for the proposed water users.

(9) *Inspections.* Except as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section, a qualified registered professional engineer or other qualified professional specialist under the direction of a professional engineer must inspect each impoundment as provided in paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section. The professional engineer or specialist must be experienced in the construction of impoundments.

(i) Inspections must be made regularly during construction, upon completion of construction, and at least yearly until removal of the structure or release of the performance bond.

(ii) After each inspection required by paragraph (a)(9)(i) of this section, the qualified registered professional engineer, or qualified registered professional land surveyor as specified in paragraph (a)(9)(iv) of this section, must promptly provide to the regulatory authority a certified report that the impoundment has been constructed and/or maintained as designed and in accordance with the approved plan and this chapter. The report must include a discussion of any appearance of instability, any structural weakness or other hazardous condition, the depth and elevation of any impounded waters, the existing storage capacity, any existing or required monitoring procedures and instrumentation, and any other aspects of the structure affecting stability.

(iii) You must retain a copy of the report at or near the minesite.

(iv) In any state that authorizes land surveyors to prepare and certify plans in accordance with § 780.25(b)(1) of this chapter, a qualified registered professional land surveyor may inspect any temporary or permanent impoundment that does not meet the criteria of § 77.216(a) of this title, or that is not classified as having a significant or high hazard potential under § 780.25(a) of this chapter, and certify and submit the report required by paragraph (a)(9)(ii) of this section, except that a qualified registered professional engineer must certify all coal mine waste impounding structures covered by § 816.84 of this chapter. The professional land surveyor must be experienced in the construction of impoundments.

(10) *Examinations.* (i) Impoundments that meet the criteria of § 77.216 of this title, or that are classified as having a significant or high hazard potential under § 780.25(a) of this chapter, must be examined in accordance with § 77.216-3 of this title.
