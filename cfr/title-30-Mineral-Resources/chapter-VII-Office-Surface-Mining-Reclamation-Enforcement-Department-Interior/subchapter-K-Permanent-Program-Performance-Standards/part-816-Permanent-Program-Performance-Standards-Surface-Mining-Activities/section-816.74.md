##### § 816.74 What special requirements apply to the disposal of excess spoil on a preexisting bench? #####

(a) *General requirements.* The regulatory authority may approve the disposal of excess spoil through placement on a preexisting bench on a previously mined area or a bond forfeiture site if -

(1) The proposed permit area includes the portion of the preexisting bench on which the spoil will be placed;

(2) The proposed operation will comply with the applicable requirements of § 816.102 of this part; and

(3) The requirements of this section are met.

(b) *Requirements for removal and disposition of vegetation, other organic matter, and soil materials.* You must remove all vegetation, other organic matter, topsoil, and subsoil from the disposal area prior to placement of the excess spoil and store, redistribute, or otherwise use those materials in accordance with § 816.22 of this part. You may use soil substitutes and supplements if approved in the permit in accordance with § 780.12(e) of this chapter.

(c)(1) The fill must be designed and constructed using current, prudent engineering practices.

(2) The design must be certified by a registered professional engineer.

(3) If the disposal area contains springs, natural or manmade water courses, or wet weather seeps, the fill design must include underdrains and temporary diversions as necessary to control erosion, prevent water infiltration into the fill, and ensure stability. Underdrains must comply with the requirements of § 816.71(f)(3) of this part.

(d)(1) The spoil must be placed on the solid portion of the bench in a controlled manner and concurrently compacted as necessary to attain a long-term static safety factor of 1.3 for all portions of the fill.

(2) Any spoil deposited on any fill portion of the bench must be treated as an excess spoil fill under § 816.71 of this part.

(e) You must grade the spoil placed on the preexisting bench to -

(1) Achieve a stable slope that does not exceed the angle of repose.

(2) Eliminate the preexisting highwall to the maximum extent technically practical, using all reasonably available spoil, as that term is defined in § 701.5 of this chapter.

(3) Minimize erosion and water pollution both on and off the site.

(f) All disturbed areas, including diversion channels that are not riprapped or otherwise protected, must be revegetated upon completion of construction.

(g) You may not construct permanent impoundments on preexisting benches on which excess spoil is placed under this section.

(h) The final configuration of the fill on the preexisting bench must -

(1) Be compatible with natural drainage patterns and the surrounding area.

(2) Support the approved postmining land use.
