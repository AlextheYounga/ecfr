##### ยง 550.245 What hydrogen sulfide (H2S) information must accompany the DPP or DOCD? #####

The following H2S information, as applicable, must accompany your DPP or DOCD:

(a) *Concentration.* The estimated concentration of any H2S you might encounter or handle while you conduct your proposed development and production activities.

(b) *Classification.* Under 30 CFR 250.490(c), a request that the Regional Supervisor classify the area of your proposed development and production activities as either H2S absent, H2S present, or H2S unknown. Provide sufficient information to justify your request.

(c) *H*2S *Contingency Plan.* If you request that the Regional Supervisor classify the area of your proposed development and production activities as either H2S present or H2S unknown, an H2S Contingency Plan prepared under 30 CFR 250.490(f), or a reference to an approved or submitted H2S Contingency Plan that covers the proposed development and production activities.

(d) *Modeling report.* (1) If you have determined or estimated that the concentration of any H2S you may encounter or handle while you conduct your development and production activities will be greater than 500 parts per million (ppm), you must:

(i) Model a potential worst case H2S release from the facilities you will use to conduct your proposed development and production activities; and

(ii) Include a modeling report or modeling results, or a reference to such report or results if you have already submitted it to the Regional Supervisor.

(2) The analysis in the modeling report must be specific to the particular site of your development and production activities, and must consider any nearby human-occupied OCS facilities, shipping lanes, fishery areas, and other points where humans may be subject to potential exposure from an H2S release from your proposed activities.

(3) If any H2S emissions are projected to affect an onshore location in concentrations greater than 10 ppm, the modeling analysis must be consistent with the EPA's risk management plan methodologies outlined in 40 CFR part 68.
