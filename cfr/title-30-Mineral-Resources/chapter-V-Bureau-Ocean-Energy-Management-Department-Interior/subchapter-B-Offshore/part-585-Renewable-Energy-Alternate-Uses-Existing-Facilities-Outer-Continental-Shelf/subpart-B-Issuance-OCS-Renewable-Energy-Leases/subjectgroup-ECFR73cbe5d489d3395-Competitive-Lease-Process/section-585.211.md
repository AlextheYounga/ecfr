##### ยง 585.211 What is the process for competitive issuance of leases? #####

BOEM will use auctions to award leases on a competitive basis. We will publish details of the process to be employed for each lease sale auction in the Federal Register. For each lease sale, we will publish a Proposed Sale Notice and a Final Sale Notice. Individual lease sales will include steps such as:

(a) *Call for Information and Nominations (Call).* BOEM will publish in the Federal Register Calls for Information and Nominations for leasing in specified areas. The comment period following issuance of a Call will be 45 days. In this document, we may:

(1) Request comments on areas which should receive special consideration and analysis;

(2) Request comments concerning geological conditions (including bottom hazards); archaeological sites on the seabed or nearshore; multiple uses of the proposed leasing area (including navigation, recreation, and fisheries); and other socioeconomic, biological, and environmental information; and

(3) Suggest areas to be considered by the respondents for leasing.

(b) *Area Identification.* BOEM will identify areas for environmental analysis and consideration for leasing. We will do this in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, States, local governments, affected Indian Tribes, and other interested parties.

(1) We may consider for lease those areas nominated in response to the Call for Information and Nominations, together with other areas that BOEM determines are appropriate for leasing.

(2) We will evaluate the potential effect of leasing on the human, marine, and coastal environments, and develop measures to mitigate adverse impacts, including lease stipulations.

(3) We will consult to develop measures, including lease stipulations and conditions, to mitigate adverse impacts on the environment; and

(4) We may hold public hearings on the environmental analysis after appropriate notice.

(c) *Proposed Sale Notice.* BOEM will publish the Proposed Sale Notice in the Federal Register and send it to the Governor of any affected State, any Indian Tribe that might be affected, and the executive of any local government that might be affected. The comment period following issuance of a Proposed Sale Notice will be 60 days.

(d) *Final Sale Notice.* BOEM will publish the Final Sale Notice in the Federal Register at least 30 days before the date of the sale.
