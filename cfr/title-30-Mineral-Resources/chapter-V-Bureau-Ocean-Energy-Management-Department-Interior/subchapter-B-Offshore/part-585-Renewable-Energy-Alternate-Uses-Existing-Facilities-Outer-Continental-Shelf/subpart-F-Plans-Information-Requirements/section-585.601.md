##### § 585.601 When am I required to submit my plans to BOEM? #####

You must submit your plans as follows:

(a) You may submit your SAP or GAP prior to lease or grant issuance, but must submit your SAP or your GAP no later than 12 months from the date of lease or grant issuance.

(b) If you intend to continue your commercial lease with an operations term, you must submit a COP, or a FERC license application, at least 6 months before the end of your site assessment term.

(c) You may submit your COP or FERC license application with your SAP.

(1) You must provide sufficient data and information with your COP for BOEM to complete the needed reviews and NEPA analysis; and
