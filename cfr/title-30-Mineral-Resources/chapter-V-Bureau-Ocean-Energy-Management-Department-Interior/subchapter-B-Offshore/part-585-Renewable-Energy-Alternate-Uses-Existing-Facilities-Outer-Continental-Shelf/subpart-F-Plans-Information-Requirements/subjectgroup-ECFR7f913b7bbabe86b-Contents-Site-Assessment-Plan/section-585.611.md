##### ยง 585.611 What information and certifications must I submit with my SAP to assist BOEM in complying with NEPA and other relevant laws? #####

You must submit, with your SAP, detailed information to assist BOEM in complying with NEPA and other relevant laws as appropriate.

(a) A SAP submitted for an area in which BOEM has not previously reviewed site assessment activities under NEPA or other applicable Federal laws, must describe those resources, conditions, and activities listed in the following table that could be affected by your proposed activities or that could affect the activities proposed in your SAP.

(b) For a SAP submitted for an area in which BOEM has previously considered site assessment activities under applicable Federal law (e.g., a NEPA analysis and CZMA consistency determination for site assessment activities), BOEM will review the SAP to determine if its impacts are consistent with those previously considered. If the anticipated effects of your proposed SAP activities are significantly different than those previously anticipated, we may determine that additional NEPA and other relevant Federal reviews are required. In that case, BOEM will notify you of such determination, and you must submit a SAP that describes those resources, conditions, and activities listed in the following table that could be affected by your proposed activities or that could affect the activities proposed in your SAP, including:
