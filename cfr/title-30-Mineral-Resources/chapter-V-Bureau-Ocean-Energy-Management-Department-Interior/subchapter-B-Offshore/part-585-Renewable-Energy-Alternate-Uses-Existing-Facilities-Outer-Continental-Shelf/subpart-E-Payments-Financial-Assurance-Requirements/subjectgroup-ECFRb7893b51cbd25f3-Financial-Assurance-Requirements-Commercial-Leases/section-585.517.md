##### ยง 585.517 How will BOEM determine the amounts of the supplemental and decommissioning financial assurance requirements associated with commercial leases? #####

(a) BOEM will base the determination for the amounts of the SAP, COP, and decommissioning financial assurance requirements on estimates of the cost to meet all accrued lease obligations.

(b) We determine the amount of the supplemental and decommissioning financial assurance requirements on a case-by-case basis. The amount of the financial assurance must be no less than the amount required to meet all lease obligations, including:

(1) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the Government over the next 12 months;

(2) Any past due rent and other payments;

(3) Other monetary obligations; and

(4) The estimated cost of facility decommissioning, as required by subpart I of this part.

(c) If your cumulative potential obligations and liabilities increase or decrease, we may adjust the amount of supplemental or the decommissioning financial assurance.

(1) If we propose adjusting your financial assurance amount, we will notify you of the proposed adjustment and give you an opportunity to comment; and

(2) We may approve a reduced financial assurance amount if you request it and if the reduced amount that you request continues to be greater than the sum of:

(i) The projected amount of rent and other payments due the Government over the next 12 months;

(ii) Any past due rent and other payments;

(iii) Other monetary obligations; and

(iv) The estimated cost of facility decommissioning.
