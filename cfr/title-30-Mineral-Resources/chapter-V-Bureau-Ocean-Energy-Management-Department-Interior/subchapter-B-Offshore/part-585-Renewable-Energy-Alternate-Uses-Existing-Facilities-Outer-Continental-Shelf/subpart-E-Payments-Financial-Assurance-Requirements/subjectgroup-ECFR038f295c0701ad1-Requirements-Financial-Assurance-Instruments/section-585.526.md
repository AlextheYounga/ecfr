##### § 585.526 What instruments other than a surety bond may I use to meet the financial assurance requirement? #####

(a) You may use other types of security instruments, if BOEM determines that such security protects BOEM to the same extent as the surety bond. BOEM will consider pledges of the following:

(1) U.S. Department of Treasury securities identified in 31 CFR part 225;

(2) Cash in an amount equal to the required dollar amount of the financial assurance, to be deposited and maintained in a Federal depository account of the U.S. Treasury by BOEM;

(3) Certificates of deposit or savings accounts in a bank or financial institution organized or authorized to transact business in the United States with:

(i) Minimum net assets of $500,000,000; and

(ii) Minimum Bankrate.com Safe & Sound rating of 3 Stars, and Capitalization, Assets, Equity and Liquidity (CAEL) rating of 3 or less;

(4) Negotiable U.S. Government, State, and municipal securities or bonds having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of the BOEM;

(5) Investment-grade rated securities having a Standard and Poor's rating of AAA or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized securities rating service having a market value of not less than the required dollar amount of the financial assurance and maintained in a Securities Investors Protection Corporation insured trust account by a licensed securities brokerage firm for the benefit of BOEM; and

(6) Insurance, if its form and function is such that the funding or enforceable pledges of funding are used to guarantee performance of regulatory obligations in the event of default on such obligations by the lessee. Insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “superior” or an equivalent rating from a nationally recognized insurance rating service.

(b) If you use a Treasury security:

(1) You must post 115 percent of your financial assurance amount;

(2) You must monitor the collateral value of your security. If the collateral value of your security as determined in accordance with the 31 CFR part 203 Collateral Margins Table (which can be found at *http://www.treasurydirect.gov*) falls below the required level of coverage, you must pledge additional security to provide 115 percent of the required amount; and

(3) You must include with your pledge authority for us to sell the security and use the proceeds if we determine that you have failed to comply with any of the terms and conditions of your lease or grant, any subsequent approval or authorization, or applicable regulations.

(c) If you use the instruments described in paragraphs (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this section, you must provide BOEM by the end of each calendar year a certified statement describing the nature and market value of the instruments maintained in that account, and including any current statements or reports furnished by the brokerage firm to the lessee concerning the asset value of the account.
