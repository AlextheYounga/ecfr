##### ยง 585.824 How must I conduct self-inspections? #####

(a) You must develop a comprehensive annual self-inspection plan covering all of your facilities. You must keep this plan wherever you keep your records and make it available to BOEM inspectors upon request. Your plan must specify:

(1) The type, extent, and frequency of in-place inspections that you will conduct for both the above-water and the below-water structures of all facilities and pertinent components of the mooring systems for any floating facilities; and

(2) How you are monitoring the corrosion protection for both the above-water and below-water structures.

(b) You must submit a report annually to us no later than November 1 that must include:

(1) A list of facilities inspected in the preceding 12 months;

(2) The type of inspection employed, (*i.e.,* visual, magnetic particle, ultrasonic testing); and

(3) A summary of the inspection indicating what repairs, if any, were needed and the overall structural condition of the facility.
