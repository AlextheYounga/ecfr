##### ยง 585.307 How will BOEM determine whether competitive interest exists for ROW grants and RUE grants? #####

To determine whether or not there is competitive interest:

(a) We will publish a public notice, describing the parameters of the project, to give affected and interested parties an opportunity to comment on the proposed ROW grant or RUE grant area.

(b) We will evaluate any comments received on the notice and make a determination of the level of competitive interest.
