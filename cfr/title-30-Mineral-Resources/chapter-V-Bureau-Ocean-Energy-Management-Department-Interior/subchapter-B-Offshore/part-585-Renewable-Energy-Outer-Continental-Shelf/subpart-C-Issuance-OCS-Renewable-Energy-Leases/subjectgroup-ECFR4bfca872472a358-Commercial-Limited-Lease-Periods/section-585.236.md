The preliminary period begins on the effective date of the lease                                                                                                 |If we receive a GAP that satisfies the requirements of §§ 585.640 through 585.648, the preliminary period will be automatically extended for the period of time necessary for us to conduct a technical and environmental review of the GAP|The GAP must meet the requirements of §§ 585.640 through 585.648.|
|(2) Each limited lease has an operations period as specified by BOEM (if the lease is issued competitively) or negotiated with the applicant (if the lease is issued noncompetitively).
