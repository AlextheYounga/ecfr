(c) When proposing site assessment activities in an area BOEM previously considered, BOEM will review your SAP to determine if its impacts are consistent with those previously considered. If the anticipated effects of your proposed SAP activities are significantly different than those previously anticipated, we may determine that additional NEPA and other relevant Federal reviews are required. In that case, BOEM will notify you of such determination, and you must submit information required in paragraph (b) of this section as appropriate.
