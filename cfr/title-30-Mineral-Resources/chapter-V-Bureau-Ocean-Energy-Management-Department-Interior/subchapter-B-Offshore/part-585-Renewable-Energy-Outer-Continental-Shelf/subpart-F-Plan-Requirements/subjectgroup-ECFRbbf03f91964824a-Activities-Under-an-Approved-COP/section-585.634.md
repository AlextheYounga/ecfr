##### § 585.634 What activities require a revision to my COP, and when will BOEM approve the revision? #####

(a) You must notify BOEM in writing before conducting any activities not described in your approved COP, describing in detail the type of activities you propose to conduct. We will determine whether the activities you propose are authorized by your existing COP or require a revision to your COP. We may request additional information from you, if necessary, to make this determination.

(b) BOEM will periodically review the activities conducted under an approved COP. The frequency and extent of the review will be based on the significance of any changes in available information, and on onshore or offshore conditions affecting, or affected by, the activities conducted under your COP. If the review indicates that the COP should be revised to meet the requirement of this part, BOEM will require you to submit the needed revisions.

(c) Activities for which a proposed revision to your COP will likely be necessary include:

(1) Activities not described in your approved COP;

(2) Modifications to the size or type of facility or equipment you will use;

(3) Change in the surface location of a facility or structure;

(4) Addition of a facility or structure not described in your approved COP;

(5) Change in the location of your onshore support base from one State to another or to a new base requiring expansion;

(6) Changes in the location of bottom disturbances (anchors, chains, *etc.*) by 500 feet (152 meters) or greater from the approved locations (e.g., if a specific anchor pattern was approved as a mitigation measure to avoid contact with bottom features, any change in the proposed bottom disturbances would likely trigger the need for a revision);

(7) Structural failure of one or more facilities; or

(8) Change in any other activity specified by BOEM.

(d) We may begin the appropriate NEPA analysis and relevant consultations when we determine that a proposed revision could:

(1) Result in a significant change in the impacts previously identified and evaluated;

(2) Require any additional Federal authorizations; or

(3) Involve activities not previously identified and evaluated.

(e) When you propose a revision, we may approve the revision if we determine that the revision is:

(1) Designed not to cause undue harm or damage to natural resources; life (including human and wildlife); property; the marine, coastal, or human environment; or sites, structures, or objects of historical or archaeological significance; and

(2) Otherwise consistent with the provisions of subsection 8(p) of the OCS Lands Act.
