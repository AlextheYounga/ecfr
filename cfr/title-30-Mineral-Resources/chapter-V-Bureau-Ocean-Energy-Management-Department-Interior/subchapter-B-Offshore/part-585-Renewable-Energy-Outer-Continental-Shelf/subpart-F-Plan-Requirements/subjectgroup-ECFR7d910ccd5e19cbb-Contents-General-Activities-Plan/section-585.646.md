##### § 585.646 What information and certifications must I submit with my GAP to assist BOEM in complying with NEPA and other relevant laws? #####

You must submit, with your GAP, detailed information to assist BOEM in complying with NEPA and other relevant laws as appropriate.

(a) A GAP submitted for an area in which BOEM has not reviewed GAP activities under NEPA or other applicable Federal laws must describe those resources, conditions, and activities listed in the following table that could be affected by your proposed activities or that could affect the activities proposed in your GAP.

(b) For a GAP submitted for an area in which BOEM has considered GAP activities under applicable Federal law (*e.g.,* a NEPA analysis and CZMA consistency determination for the GAP activities), BOEM will review the GAP to determine if its impacts are consistent with those previously considered. If the anticipated effects of your proposed GAP activities are significantly different than those previously anticipated, we may determine that additional NEPA and other relevant Federal reviews are required. In that case, BOEM will notify you of such determination, and you must submit a GAP that describes those resources, conditions, and activities listed in the following table that could be affected by your proposed activities or that could affect the activities proposed in your GAP, including:
