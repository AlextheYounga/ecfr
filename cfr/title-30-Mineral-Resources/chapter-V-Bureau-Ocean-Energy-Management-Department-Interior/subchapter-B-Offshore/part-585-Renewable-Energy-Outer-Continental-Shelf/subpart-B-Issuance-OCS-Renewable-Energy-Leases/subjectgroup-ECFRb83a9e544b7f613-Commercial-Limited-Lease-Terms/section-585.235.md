The preliminary term begins on the effective date of the lease                                                                                                                            |If BOEM receives a SAP that satisfies the requirements of §§ 585.605-585.613 or a SAP/COP that satisfies the requirements of §§ 585.605-585.613 and §§ 585.620-585.628, the preliminary term will be extended for the time necessary for us to conduct technical and environmental reviews of the SAP or SAP/COP|        The SAP must meet the requirements of §§ 585.605-585.613.

|(3) A commercial lease will have an operations term of 25 years, unless a longer term is negotiated by the parties. A request for lease renewal must be submitted two years before the end of the operations term. If you submit a COP, your operations term begins on the date that BOEM approves the COP. If you submit a SAP/COP, your operations term begins on the earliest of the following dates: five years after BOEM approves the SAP/COP; when fabrication begins; or, when installation commences|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                         The lease renewal request must meet the requirements in §§ 585.425-585.429.                                          |

The term of the lease renewal will not exceed the original term of the lease, unless a longer term is negotiated by the parties. The lease renewal term begins upon expiration of the original operations term                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |NOTE: BOEM may also order or grant a suspension of the operations term, as provided in §§ 585.415-585.421 thereby effectively extending the term of the lease.|

(b) If you do not timely submit a SAP, COP, or SAP/COP, as appropriate, you may request additional time to extend the preliminary or site assessment term of your commercial lease that includes a revised schedule for submission of the plan, as appropriate.
