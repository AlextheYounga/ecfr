(a) If your surety becomes bankrupt, insolvent, or has its charter or license suspended or revoked, any bond coverage from that surety terminates immediately.

(b) You must notify the Regional Director of any action filed alleging that you, your surety, or your guarantor are insolvent or bankrupt. You must notify the Regional Director within 72 hours of learning of such an action. All bonds must require the surety to provide this information to you and directly to BOEM.
