##### § 553.51 What are the penalties for not complying with this part? #####

(a) If you fail to comply with the financial responsibility requirements of OPA at 33 U.S.C. 2716 or with the requirements of this part, then you may be liable for a civil penalty of up to $45,268 per COF per day of violation (that is, each day a COF is operated without acceptable evidence of OSFR).

(b) BOEM will determine the date of a noncompliance. BOEM will assess penalties in accordance with an OSFR penalty schedule using the procedures found at 30 CFR part 550, subpart N. You may obtain a copy of the penalty schedule from BOEM at the address in § 553.45.

(c) BOEM may assess a civil penalty against you that is greater or less than the amount in the penalty schedule after taking into account the factors in section 4303(a) of OPA (33 U.S.C. 2716a).

(d) If you fail to correct a deficiency in the OSFR evidence for a COF, then the Director may suspend operation of a COF in the OCS under 30 CFR 250.170 or seek judicial relief, including an order suspending the operation of any COF.
