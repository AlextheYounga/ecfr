(3) The Director may determine that you must demonstrate an amount of OSFR greater than the amount in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section based on the relative operational, environmental, human health, and other risks that your COF poses. The Director may require an amount that is one or more levels higher than the amount indicated in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for your COF. The Director will not require an OSFR demonstration that exceeds $150 million.

(4) You must demonstrate OSFR in the lowest amount specified in the applicable table in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section for a facility with a potential worst case oil-spill discharge of 1,000 bbls or less if the Director notifies you in writing that the demonstration is justified by the risks of the potential oil-spill discharge.
