(2) Mooring, tendon, or tethering systems.

(c) You must submit your FDR to BSEE pursuant to § 285.110 and provide the location of records, as required in § 285.714(c).

(d) If you are required to use a CVA, the FDR must include the following certification statement with accompanying justification: “The design of this structure has been certified by a BSEE-approved CVA to be in accordance with accepted engineering practices and the approved SAP, GAP, or COP, as applicable, and has been designed to provide for safety. The certified design and as-built plans and specifications will be on file at [provide location].”
