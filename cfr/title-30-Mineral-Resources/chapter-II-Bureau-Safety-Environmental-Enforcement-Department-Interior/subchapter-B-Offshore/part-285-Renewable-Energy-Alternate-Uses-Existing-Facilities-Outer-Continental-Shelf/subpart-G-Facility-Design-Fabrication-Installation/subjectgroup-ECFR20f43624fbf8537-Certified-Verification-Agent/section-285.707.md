##### ยง 285.707 What are the CVA's primary duties for facility design review? #####

If you are required to use a CVA:

(a) The CVA must use good engineering judgment and practices in conducting an independent assessment of the design of the facility. The CVA must certify in the Facility Design Report to BSEE that the facility is designed to withstand the environmental and functional load conditions appropriate for the intended service life at the proposed location.

(b) The CVA must conduct an independent assessment of all proposed:

(1) Planning criteria;

(2) Operational requirements;

(3) Environmental loading data;

(4) Load determinations;

(5) Stress analyses;

(6) Material designations;

(7) Soil and foundation conditions;

(8) Safety factors; and

(9) Other pertinent parameters of the proposed design.

(c) For any floating facility, the CVA must ensure that any requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard for structural integrity and stability (*e.g.,* verification of center of gravity), have been met. The CVA must also consider:

(1) Foundations, foundation pilings and templates, and anchoring systems; and

(2) Mooring or tethering systems.
