##### § 250.226 When and how must I submit each applicable Conceptual Plan? #####

You must submit each applicable Conceptual Plan to the Regional Supervisor after you have decided on the general concept(s) for a project or system, and before you finalize engineering design of the equipment, well, well safety control system, or subsea production systems. You must submit, for BSEE approval, each Conceptual Plan according to the following table:
