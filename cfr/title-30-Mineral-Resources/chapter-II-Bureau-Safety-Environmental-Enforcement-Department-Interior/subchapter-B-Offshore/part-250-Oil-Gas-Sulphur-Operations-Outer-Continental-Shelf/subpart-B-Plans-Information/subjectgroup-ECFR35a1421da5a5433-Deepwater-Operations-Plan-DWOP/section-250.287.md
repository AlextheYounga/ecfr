##### ยง 250.287 For what development projects must I submit a DWOP? #####

You must submit a DWOP for each development project in which you will use non-conventional production or completion technology, regardless of water depth. If you are unsure whether BSEE considers the technology of your project non-conventional, you must contact the Regional Supervisor for guidance.
