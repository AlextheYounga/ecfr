##### ยง 250.432 How do I obtain a departure to diverter design and installation requirements? #####

The table below describes possible departures from the diverter requirements and the conditions required for each departure. To obtain one of these departures, you must have discussed the departure in your APD and received approval from the District Manager.

|                                     If you want a departure to:                                      |                                                   Then you must . . .                                                    |

|                   (a) Use flexible hose for diverter lines instead of rigid pipe,                    |                                    Use flexible hose that has integral end couplings.                                    |
|                       (b) Use only one spool outlet for your diverter system,                        |(1) Have branch lines that meet the minimum internal diameter requirements; and (2) Provide downwind diversion capability.|
|(c) Use a spool with an outlet with an internal diameter of less than 10 inches on a surface wellhead,|                    Use a spool that has dual outlets with an internal diameter of at least 8 inches.                     |
|(d) Use a single diverter line for floating drilling operations on a dynamically positioned drillship,|                        Maintain an appropriate vessel heading to provide for downwind diversion.                         |
