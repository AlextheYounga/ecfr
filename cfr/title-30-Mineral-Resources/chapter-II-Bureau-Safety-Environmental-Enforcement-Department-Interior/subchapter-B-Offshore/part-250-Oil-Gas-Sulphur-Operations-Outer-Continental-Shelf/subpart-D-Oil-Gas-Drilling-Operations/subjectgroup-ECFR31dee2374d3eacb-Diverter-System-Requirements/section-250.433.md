##### ยง 250.433 What are the diverter actuation and testing requirements? #####

When you install the diverter system, you must actuate the diverter sealing element, diverter valves, and diverter-control systems and control stations. You must also flow-test the vent lines.

(a) For drilling operations with a surface wellhead configuration, you must actuate the diverter system at least once every 24-hour period after the initial test. After you have nippled up on conductor casing, you must pressure-test the diverter-sealing element and diverter valves to a minimum of 200 psi. While the diverter is installed, you must conduct subsequent pressure tests within 7 days after the previous test.

(b) For floating drilling operations with a subsea BOP stack, you must actuate the diverter system within 7 days after the previous actuation.

(c) You must alternate actuations and tests between control stations.
