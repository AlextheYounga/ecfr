##### § 250.1741 If I drag a trawl across a site, what requirements must I meet? #####

If you drag a trawl across the site in accordance with § 250.1740, you must meet all of the requirements of this section.

|                            (1) Well site,                            |      300-foot-radius circle centered on the well location.       |
|                        (2) Subsea well site,                         |      600-foot-radius circle centered on the well location.       |
|                          (3) Platform site,                          |1,320-foot-radius circle centered on the location of the platform.|
|(4) Single-well caisson, well protector jacket, template, or manifold,|    600-foot-radius circle centered on the structure location.    |

(b) You must trawl 100 percent of the limits described in paragraph (a) of this section in two directions.

(c) You must mark the area to be cleared as a hazard to navigation according to USCG requirements until you complete the site clearance procedures.

(d) You must use a trawling vessel equipped with a calibrated navigational positioning system capable of providing position accuracy of ±30 feet.

(e) You must use a trawling net that is representative of those used in the commercial fishing industry (one that has a net strength equal or greater than that provided by No. 18 twine).

(f) You must ensure that you trawl no closer than 300 feet from a shipwreck, and 500 feet from a sensitive biological feature.

(g) If you trawl near an active pipeline, you must meet the requirements in the following table:

|                                                         For . . .                                                          |                   You must trawl . . .                    |                                                       And you must . . .                                                        |

|                                                (1) Buried active pipelines,                                                |                                                           |First contact the pipeline owner or operator to determine the condition of the pipeline before trawling over the buried pipeline.|
|                           (2) Unburied active pipelines that are 8 inches in diameter or larger,                           |no closer than 100 feet to the either side of the pipeline,|                                Trawl parallel to the pipeline Do not trawl across the pipeline.                                 |
|  (3) Unburied smaller diameter active pipelines in the trawl area that have obstructions (e.g., pipeline valves) present,  |  no closer than 100 feet to either side of the pipeline,  |                                Trawl parallel to the pipeline. Do not trawl across the pipeline.                                |
|(4) Unburied active pipelines in the trawl area that are smaller than 8 inches in diameter and have no obstructions present,|                 parallel to the pipeline,                 |                                                                                                                                 |
