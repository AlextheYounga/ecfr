(c) The CVA must submit interim reports and a final report to the Regional Supervisor, and to you, during the design phase in accordance with the approved schedule required by ยง 250.911(d). In each interim and final report the CVA must:

(1) Provide a summary of the material reviewed and the CVA's findings;

(2) In the final CVA report, make a recommendation that the Regional Supervisor either accept, request modifications, or reject the proposed design unless such a recommendation has been previously made in an interim report;

(3) Describe the particulars of how, by whom, and when the independent review was conducted; and

(4) Provide any additional comments the CVA deems necessary.
