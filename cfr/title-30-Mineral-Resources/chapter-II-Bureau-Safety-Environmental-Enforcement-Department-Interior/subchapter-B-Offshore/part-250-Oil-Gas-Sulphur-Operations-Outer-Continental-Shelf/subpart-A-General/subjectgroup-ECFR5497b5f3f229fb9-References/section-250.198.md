##### § 250.198 Documents incorporated by reference. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 49255, Sept. 28, 2018.

(a) The BSEE is incorporating by reference the documents listed in paragraphs (e) through (k) of this section. Paragraphs (e) through (k) identify the publishing organization of the documents, the address and phone number where you may obtain these documents, and the documents incorporated by reference. The Director of the Federal Register has approved the incorporations by reference according to 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.

(1) Incorporation by reference of a document is limited to the edition of the publication that is cited in this section. Future amendments or revisions of the document are not included. The BSEE will publish any changes to a document in the Federal Register and amend this section.

(2) The BSEE may make the rule amending the document effective without prior opportunity for public comment when BSEE determines:

(i) That the revisions to a document result in safety improvements or represent new industry standard technology and do not impose undue costs on the affected parties; and

(ii) The BSEE meets the requirements for making a rule immediately effective under 5 U.S.C. 553.

(3) The effect of incorporation by reference of a document into the regulations in this part is that the incorporated document is a requirement. When a section in this part incorporates all of a document, you are responsible for complying with the provisions of that entire document, except to the extent that the section which incorporates the document by reference provides otherwise. When a section in this part incorporates part of a document, you are responsible for complying with that part of the document as provided in that section.

(b) The BSEE incorporated each document or specific portion by reference in the sections noted. The entire document is incorporated by reference, unless the text of the corresponding sections in this part calls for compliance with specific portions of the listed documents. In each instance, the applicable document is the specific edition or specific edition and supplement or addendum cited in this section.

(c) Under §§ 250.141 and 250.142, you may comply with a later edition of a specific document incorporated by reference, provided:

(1) You show that complying with the later edition provides a degree of protection, safety, or performance equal to or better than would be achieved by compliance with the listed edition; and

(2) You obtain the prior written approval for alternative compliance from the authorized BSEE official.

(d) You may inspect these documents at the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, 45600 Woodland Rd, Sterling, VA 20166; phone: 1-844-259-4779; or at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
