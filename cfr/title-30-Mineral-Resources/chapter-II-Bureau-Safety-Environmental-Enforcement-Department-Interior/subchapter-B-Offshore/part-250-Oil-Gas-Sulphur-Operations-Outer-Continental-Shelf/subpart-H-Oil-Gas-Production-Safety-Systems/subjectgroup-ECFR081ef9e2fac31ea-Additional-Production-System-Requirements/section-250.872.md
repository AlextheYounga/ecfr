Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 49259, Sept. 28, 2018.

(a) You must equip atmospheric vessels used to process and/or store liquid hydrocarbons or other Class I liquids as described in API RP 500 or 505 (both incorporated by reference as specified in ยง 250.198) with protective equipment identified in API RP 14C, section A.5 (incorporated by reference as specified in ยง 250.198). Transport tanks approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation, that are sealed and not connected via interconnected piping to the production process train and that are used only for storage of refined liquid hydrocarbons or Class I liquids, are not required to be equipped with the protective equipment identified in API RP 14C, section A.5.

(b) You must ensure that all atmospheric vessels are designed and maintained to ensure the proper working conditions for LSH sensors. The LSH sensor bridle must be designed to prevent different density fluids from impacting sensor functionality. For atmospheric vessels that have oil buckets, the LSH sensor must be installed to sense the level in the oil bucket.

(c) You must ensure that all flame arrestors are maintained to ensure proper design function (installation of a system to allow for ease of inspection should be considered).
