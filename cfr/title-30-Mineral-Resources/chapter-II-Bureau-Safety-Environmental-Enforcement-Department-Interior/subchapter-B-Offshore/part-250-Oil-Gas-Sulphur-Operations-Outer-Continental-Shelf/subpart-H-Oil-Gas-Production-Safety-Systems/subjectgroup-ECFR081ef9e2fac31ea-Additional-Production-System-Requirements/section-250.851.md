(b) *Operating pressure ranges.* You must use pressure recording devices to establish the new operating pressure ranges of pressure vessels at any time that the normalized system pressure changes by 50 psig or 5 percent. Once system pressure has stabilized, pressure recording devices must be utilized to establish the new operating pressure ranges. The pressure recording devices must document the pressure range over time intervals that are no less than 4 hours and no more than 30 days long. You must maintain the pressure recording information you used to determine current operating pressure ranges at your field office nearest the OCS facility or at another location conveniently available to the District Manager for as long as the information is valid.

(c) Pressure shut-in sensors must be set according to the following table (initial set points for pressure sensors must be set utilizing gauge readings and engineering design):

|         Type of sensor          |                                                        Settings                                                        |                                                                                    Additional requirements                                                                                    |

|(1) High pressure shut-in sensor,|Must be set no higher than 15 percent or 5 psi (whichever is greater) above the highest operating pressure of the vessel|Must also be set sufficiently below (5 percent or 5 psi, whichever is greater) the relief valve's set pressure to assure that the pressure source is shut-in before the relief valve activates.|
|(2) Low pressure shut-in sensor, | Must be set no lower than 15 percent or 5 psi (whichever is greater) below the lowest pressure in the operating range  |           You must receive specific approval from the District Manager for activation limits on pressure vessels that have a pressure safety low (PSL) sensor set less than 5 psi.            |
