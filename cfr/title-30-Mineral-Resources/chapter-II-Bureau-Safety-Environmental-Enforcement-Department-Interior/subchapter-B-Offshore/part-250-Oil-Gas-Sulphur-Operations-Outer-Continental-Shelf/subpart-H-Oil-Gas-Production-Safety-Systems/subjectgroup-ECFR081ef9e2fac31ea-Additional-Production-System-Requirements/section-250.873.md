##### § 250.873 Subsea gas lift requirements. #####

If you choose to install a subsea gas lift system, you must design your system as approved in your DWOP or as follows:

(a) Design the gas lift supply pipeline in accordance with API RP 14C (incorporated by reference as specified in § 250.198) for the gas lift supply system located on the platform.

(b) Meet the applicable requirements in the following table:
