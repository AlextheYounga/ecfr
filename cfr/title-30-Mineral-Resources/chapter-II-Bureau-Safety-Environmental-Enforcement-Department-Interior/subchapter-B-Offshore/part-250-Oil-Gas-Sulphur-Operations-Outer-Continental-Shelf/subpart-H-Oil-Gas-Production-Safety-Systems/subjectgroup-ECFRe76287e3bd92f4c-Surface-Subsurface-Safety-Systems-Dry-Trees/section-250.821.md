(a) In the event of an emergency, such as an impending National Weather Service-named tropical storm or hurricane:

(1) Any well not yet equipped with a subsurface safety device and that is capable of natural flow must have the subsurface safety device properly installed as soon as possible, with due consideration being given to personnel safety.

(2) You must shut-in (by closing the SSV and the surface-controlled SSSV) the following types of wells:

(i) All oil wells, and

(ii) All gas wells requiring compression.

(b) Closure of the SSV must not exceed 45 seconds after automatic detection of an abnormal condition or actuation of an ESD. The surface-controlled SSSV must close within 2 minutes after the shut-in signal has closed the SSV. The District Manager must approve any alternative design-delayed closure time of greater than 2 minutes based on the mechanical/production characteristics of the individual well.
