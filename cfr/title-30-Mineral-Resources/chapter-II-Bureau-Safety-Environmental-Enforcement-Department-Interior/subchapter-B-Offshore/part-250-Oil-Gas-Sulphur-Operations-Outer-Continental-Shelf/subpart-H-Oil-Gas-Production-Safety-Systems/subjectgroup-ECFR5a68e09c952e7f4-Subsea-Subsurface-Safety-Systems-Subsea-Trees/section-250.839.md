##### ยง 250.839 What are the maximum allowable valve closure times and hydraulic bleeding requirements for a direct-hydraulic control system? #####

(a) If you have a direct-hydraulic control system, you must:

(1) Design the subsea control system to meet the valve closure times listed in this section or your approved DWOP; and

(2) Verify the valve closure times upon installation. The District Manager may require you to verify the closure time of the USV(s) through visual authentication by diver or ROV.

(b) You must comply with the maximum allowable valve closure times and hydraulic system bleeding requirements listed in the following table or your approved DWOP:
