##### § 250.522 How do I manage the thermal effects caused by initial production on a newly completed or recompleted well? #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 21976, May 15, 2019.

A newly completed or recompleted well often has thermal casing pressure during initial startup. Bleeding casing pressure during the startup process is considered a normal and necessary operation to manage thermal casing pressure; therefore, you do not need to evaluate these operations as a casing diagnostic test. After 30 days of continuous production, the initial production startup operation is complete and you must perform casing diagnostic testing as required in §§ 250.520 and 250.522.
