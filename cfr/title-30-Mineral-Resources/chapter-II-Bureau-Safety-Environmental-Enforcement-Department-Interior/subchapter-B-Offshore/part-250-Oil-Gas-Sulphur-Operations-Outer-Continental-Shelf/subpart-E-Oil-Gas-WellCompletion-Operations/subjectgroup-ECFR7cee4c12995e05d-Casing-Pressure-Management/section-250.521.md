##### ยง 250.521 When do I have to perform a casing diagnostic test? #####

(a) You must perform a casing diagnostic test within 30 days after first observing or imposing casing pressure according to the following table:

|  If you have a . . .   |                                      you must perform a casing diagnostic test if . . .                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|(1) fixed platform well,|                                         the casing pressure is greater than 100 psig.                                         |
|    (2) subsea well,    |the measurable casing pressure is greater than the external hydrostatic pressure plus 100 psig measured at the subsea wellhead.|
|    (3) hybrid well,    |                  a riser or the production casing pressure is greater than 100 psig measured at the surface.                  |

(b) You are exempt from performing a diagnostic pressure test for the production casing on a well operating under active gas lift.
