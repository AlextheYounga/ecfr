##### ยง 250.523 When do I have to repeat casing diagnostic testing? #####

Casing diagnostic testing must be repeated according to the following table:

|                                                                                         When . . .                                                                                          |                                                     you must repeat diagnostic testing . . .                                                      |

|                               (b) your well, previously on gas lift, has been shut-in or returned to flowing status without gas lift for more than 180 days,                                |immediately on the production casing (A annulus). The production casing (A annulus) of wells on active gas lift are exempt from diagnostic testing.|
|                                                                      (c) your casing pressure request becomes invalid,                                                                      |                                                                  within 30 days.                                                                  |
|                                      (d) a casing or riser has an increase in pressure greater than 200 psig over the previous casing diagnostic test,                                      |                                                                  within 30 days.                                                                  |
|            (e) after any corrective action has been taken to remediate undesirable casing pressure, either as a result of a casing pressure request denial or any other action,             |                                                                  within 30 days.                                                                  |
|(f) your fixed platform well production casing (A annulus) has pressure exceeding 10 percent of its minimum internal yield pressure (MIYP), except for production casings on active gas lift,|                                               once per year, not to exceed 12 months between tests.                                               |
|                                    (g) your fixed platform well's outer casing (B, C, D, etc., annuli) has a pressure exceeding 20 percent of its MIYP,                                     |                                                         once every 5 years, at a minimum.                                                         |
