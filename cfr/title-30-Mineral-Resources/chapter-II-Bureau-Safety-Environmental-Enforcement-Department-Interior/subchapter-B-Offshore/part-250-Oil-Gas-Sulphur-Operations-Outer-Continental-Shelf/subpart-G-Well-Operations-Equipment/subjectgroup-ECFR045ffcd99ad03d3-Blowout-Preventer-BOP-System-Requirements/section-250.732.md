##### § 250.732 What are the BSEE-approved verification organization (BAVO) requirements for BOP systems and system components? #####

(a) BSEE will maintain a list of BSEE-approved verification organizations (BAVOs) on its public website that you must use to satisfy any provision in this subpart that requires a BAVO certification, verification, report, or review. You must comply with all requirements in this subpart for BAVO certification, verification, or reporting no later than 1 year from the date BSEE publishes a list of BAVOs.

(1) Until such time as you use a BAVO to perform the actions that this subpart requires to be performed by a BAVO, but not after 1 year from the date BSEE publishes a list of BAVOs, you must use an independent third-party meeting the criteria specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to prepare certifications, verifications, and reports as required by §§ 250.731(c) and (d), 250.732 (b) and (c), 250.734(b)(1), 250.738(b)(4), and 250.739(b).

(2) The independent third-party must be a technical classification society, or a licensed professional engineering firm, or a registered professional engineer capable of providing the certifications, verifications, and reports required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(3) For an organization to become a BAVO, it must submit the following information to the Chief, Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs; Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement; 45600 Woodland Road, Sterling, Virginia, 20166, for BSEE review and approval:

(i) Previous experience in verification or in the design, fabrication, installation, repair, or major modification of BOPs and related systems and equipment;

(ii) Technical capabilities;

(iii) Size and type of organization;

(iv) In-house availability of, or access to, appropriate technology. This should include computer programs, hardware, and testing materials and equipment;

(v) Ability to perform the verification functions for projects considering current commitments;

(vi) Previous experience with BSEE requirements and procedures; and

(vii) Any additional information that may be relevant to BSEE's review.

(b) Prior to beginning any operation requiring the use of any BOP, you must submit verification by a BAVO and supporting documentation as required by this paragraph to the appropriate District Manager and Regional Supervisor.
