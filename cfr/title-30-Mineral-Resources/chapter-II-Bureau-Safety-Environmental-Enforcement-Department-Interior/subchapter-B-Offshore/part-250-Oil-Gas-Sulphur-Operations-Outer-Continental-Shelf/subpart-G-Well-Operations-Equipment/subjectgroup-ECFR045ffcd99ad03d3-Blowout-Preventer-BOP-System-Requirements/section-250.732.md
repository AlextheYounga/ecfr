(b) The independent third-party must be a technical classification society, a licensed professional engineering firm, or a registered professional engineer capable of providing the required certifications and verifications.

(c) For wells in an HPHT environment, as defined by ยง 250.804(b), you must submit verification by an independent third party that it conducted a comprehensive review of the BOP system and related equipment you propose to use. You must provide the independent third party access to any facility associated with the BOP system or related equipment during the review process. You must submit the verifications required by this paragraph (c) to the appropriate District Manager and Regional Supervisor before you begin any operations in an HPHT environment with the proposed equipment.
