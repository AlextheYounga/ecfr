##### § 250.737 What are the BOP system testing requirements? #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 57348, Aug. 23, 2023.

Your BOP system (this includes the choke manifold, kelly-type valves, inside BOP, and drill string safety valve) must meet the following testing requirements:

(a) *Pressure test frequency.* You must pressure test your BOP system:

(1) When installed;

(2) Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test, or 30 days since your last blind shear ram BOP pressure test. You must begin to test your BOP system before midnight on the 14th day (or 30th day for your blind shear rams) following the conclusion of the previous test;

(3) Before drilling out each string of casing or a liner. You may omit this pressure test requirement if you did not remove the BOP stack to run the casing string or liner, the required BOP test pressures for the next section of the hole are not greater than the test pressures for the previous BOP test, and the time elapsed between tests has not exceeded 14 days (or 30 days for blind shear rams). You must indicate in your APD which casing strings and liners meet these criteria;

(4) In lieu of meeting the schedule established in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you may request that BSEE approve a 21-day BOP testing frequency. To obtain BSEE approval, you must submit a request to the appropriate BSEE Regional Supervisor, District Field Operations. Your request must demonstrate that you have developed a BOP health monitoring plan that includes certain system capabilities. As long as your plan is consistent with recognized engineering and industry practice, BSEE will approve your request if it includes the following:

(i) Condition monitoring tools, including continuous surveillance of sensor readings from the BOP control system, real-time condition analysis and displays, functional pressure signal analysis, historical sensor data;

(ii) Failure propagation analysis;

(iii) A failure tracking and resolution system that includes detailed failure reports and identification of recurring problems; and

(iv) Submission of quarterly reports of the data collected pursuant to paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(iii) to the BSEE Regional Supervisor, District Field Operations.

(5) The District Manager may require more frequent testing if conditions or your BOP performance warrant.

(b) *Pressure test procedures.* When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low-pressure test and a high-pressure test for each BOP component (excluding test rams and non-sealing shear rams). You must begin each test by conducting the low-pressure test then transition to the high-pressure test. Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. The table in this paragraph (b) outlines your pressure test requirements.

Before you may test BOP equipment to the MASP plus 500 psi, the District Manager must have approved those test pressures in your APD or APM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

(c) *Duration of pressure test.* Each test must hold the required pressure for 5 minutes, which must be recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours, or on a digital recorder. However, for surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours, or on a digital recorder. The recorded test pressures must be within the middle half of the chart range, *i.e.,* cannot be within the lower or upper one-fourth of the chart range. If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a test, you must correct the problem and retest the affected component(s).

(d) *Additional test requirements.* You must meet the following additional BOP testing requirements:

|(12) Function test autoshear/deadman, and EDS systems separately on your subsea BOP stack during the stump test. The District Manager may require additional testing of the emergency systems. You must also test the deadman system and verify closure of the shearing rams during the initial test on the seafloor|(i) You must submit test procedures with your APD or APM for District Manager approval. The procedures for these function tests must include the schematics of the actual controls and circuitry of the system that will be used during an actual autoshear or deadman event.  <br/>(ii) The procedures must also include the actions and sequence of events that take place on the approved schematics of the BOP control system and describe specifically how the ROV will be utilized during this operation.  <br/>(iii) When you conduct the initial deadman system test on the seafloor, you must ensure the well is secure and, if hydrocarbons have been present, appropriate barriers are in place to isolate hydrocarbons from the wellhead. You must also have an ROV on bottom during the test.  <br/>(iv) Following the deadman system test on the seafloor you must document the final remaining pressure of the subsea accumulator system.  <br/>(v) For the function test of the deadman system during the initial test on the seafloor, you must have the ability to quickly disconnect the LMRP should the rig experience a loss of station-keeping event. You must include your quick-disconnect procedures with your deadman test procedures.  <br/>(vi) You must confirm closure of the BSR(s) with a 1,000 psi pressure test for 5 minutes.  <br/>(vii) If a casing shear ram is installed, you must describe how you will verify closure of the ram.  <br/>(viii) You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.|

Choke and kill side outlet valves below the uppermost pipe ram must be tested to MASP plus 500 psi for the applicable hole section.  <br/>(ii) For the 30 day BSR testing, test the wellbore side of the choke and kill side outlet valves between the upper most pipe ram and the upper most ram, to the casing/liner test pressure or annular test pressure, whichever is greater.  <br/>(iii) For BOPs with only one choke and kill side outlet valve, you are only required to pressure test the choke and kill side outlet valves from the wellbore side.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

(e) Prior to conducting any shear ram tests in which you will shear pipe, you must notify the District Manager at least 72 hours in advance, to ensure that a BSEE representative will have access to the location to witness any testing.
