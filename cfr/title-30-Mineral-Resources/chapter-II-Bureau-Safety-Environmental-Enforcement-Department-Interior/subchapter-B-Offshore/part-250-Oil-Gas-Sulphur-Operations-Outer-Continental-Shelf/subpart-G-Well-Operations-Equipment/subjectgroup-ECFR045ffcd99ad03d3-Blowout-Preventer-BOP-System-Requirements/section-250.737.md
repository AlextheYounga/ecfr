##### ยง 250.737 What are the BOP system testing requirements? #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 21981, May 15, 2019.

Your BOP system (this includes the choke manifold, kelly-type valves, inside BOP, and drill string safety valve) must meet the following testing requirements:

(a) *Pressure test frequency.* You must pressure test your BOP system:

(1) When installed;

(2) Before 14 days have elapsed since your last BOP pressure test, or 30 days since your last blind shear ram BOP pressure test. You must begin to test your BOP system before midnight on the 14th day (or 30th day for your blind shear rams) following the conclusion of the previous test;

(3) Before drilling out each string of casing or a liner. You may omit this pressure test requirement if you did not remove the BOP stack to run the casing string or liner, the required BOP test pressures for the next section of the hole are not greater than the test pressures for the previous BOP test, and the time elapsed between tests has not exceeded 14 days (or 30 days for blind shear rams). You must indicate in your APD which casing strings and liners meet these criteria;

(4) The District Manager may require more frequent testing if conditions or your BOP performance warrant.

(b) *Pressure test procedures.* When you pressure test the BOP system, you must conduct a low-pressure test and a high-pressure test for each BOP component. You must begin each test by conducting the low-pressure test then transition to the high-pressure test. Each individual pressure test must hold pressure long enough to demonstrate the tested component(s) holds the required pressure. The table in this paragraph (b) outlines your pressure test requirements.

Any initial pressure above 350 psi must be bled back to a pressure between 250 and 350 psi before starting the test. If the initial pressure exceeds 500 psi, you must bleed back to zero and reinitiate the test.                           |
|(2) High-pressure test for blind shear ram-type BOPs, ram-type BOPs, the choke manifold, outside of all choke and kill side outlet valves (and annular gas bleed valves for subsea BOP), inside of all choke and kill side outlet valves below uppermost ram, and other BOP components|       The high-pressure test must equal the RWP of the equipment or be 500 psi greater than your calculated MASP, as defined for the operation for the applicable section of hole. Before you may test BOP equipment to the MASP plus 500 psi, the District Manager must have approved those test pressures in your APD.       |

Before you may test BOP equipment to the MASP plus 500 psi, the District Manager must have approved those test pressures in your APD.|

(c) *Duration of pressure test.* Each test must hold the required pressure for 5 minutes, which must be recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours. However, for surface BOP systems and surface equipment of a subsea BOP system, a 3-minute test duration is acceptable if recorded on a chart not exceeding 4 hours, or on a digital recorder. The recorded test pressures must be within the middle half of the chart range, i.e., cannot be within the lower or upper one-fourth of the chart range. If the equipment does not hold the required pressure during a test, you must correct the problem and retest the affected component(s).

(d) *Additional test requirements.* You must meet the following additional BOP testing requirements:

|(12) Function test autoshear/deadman, and EDS systems separately on your subsea BOP stack during the stump test. The District Manager may require additional testing of the emergency systems. You must also test the deadman system and verify closure of the shearing rams during the initial test on the seafloor|(i) You must submit test procedures with your APD or APM for District Manager approval. The procedures for these function tests must include the schematics of the actual controls and circuitry of the system that will be used during an actual autoshear or deadman event.  <br/>(ii) The procedures must also include the actions and sequence of events that take place on the approved schematics of the BOP control system and describe specifically how the ROV will be utilized during this operation.  <br/>(iii) When you conduct the initial deadman system test on the seafloor, you must ensure the well is secure and, if hydrocarbons have been present, appropriate barriers are in place to isolate hydrocarbons from the wellhead. You must also have an ROV on bottom during the test.  <br/>(iv) The testing of the deadman system on the seafloor must indicate the discharge pressure of the subsea accumulator system throughout the test.  <br/>(v) For the function test of the deadman system during the initial test on the seafloor, you must have the ability to quickly disconnect the LMRP should the rig experience a loss of station-keeping event. You must include your quick-disconnect procedures with your deadman test procedures.  <br/>(vi) You must pressure test the blind shear ram(s) according to paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.  <br/>(vii) If a casing shear ram is installed, you must describe how you will verify closure of the ram.  <br/>(viii) You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.|

(e) Prior to conducting any shear ram tests in which you will shear pipe, you must notify the District Manager at least 72 hours in advance, to ensure that a BSEE representative will have access to the location to witness any testing.
