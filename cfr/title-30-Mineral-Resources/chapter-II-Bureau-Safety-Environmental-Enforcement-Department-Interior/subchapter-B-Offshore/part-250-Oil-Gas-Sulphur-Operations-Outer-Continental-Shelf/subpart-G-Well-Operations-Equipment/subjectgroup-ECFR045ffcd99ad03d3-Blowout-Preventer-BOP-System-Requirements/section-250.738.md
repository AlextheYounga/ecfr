If any redundant component fails a test, you must submit a report from an independent third party that describes the failure and confirms that there is no impact on the BOP that will make it unfit for well-control purposes.

You must have, as part of your well-control plan required by § 250.710, procedures that enable the removal of the bottom hole assembly from across the BOP in the event of a well-control or emergency situation (for dynamically positioned rigs, your plan must also include steps for when the EDS must be activated) before MASP conditions are reached as defined for the operation.                                                      |
