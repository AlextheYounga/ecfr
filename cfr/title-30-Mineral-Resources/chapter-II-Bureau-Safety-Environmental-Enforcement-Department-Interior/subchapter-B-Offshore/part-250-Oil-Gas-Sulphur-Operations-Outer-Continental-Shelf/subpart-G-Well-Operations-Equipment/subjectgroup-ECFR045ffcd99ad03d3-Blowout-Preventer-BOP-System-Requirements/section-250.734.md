##### ยง 250.734 What are the requirements for a subsea BOP system? #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 21980, May 15, 2019.

(a) When you drill or conduct operations with a subsea BOP system, you must install the BOP system before drilling to deepen the well below the surface casing or before conducting operations if the well is already deepened beyond the surface casing point. The District Manager may require you to install a subsea BOP system before drilling or conducting operations below the conductor casing if proposed casing setting depths or local geology indicate the need. The following table outlines your requirements.

(b) If operations are suspended to make repairs to any part of the subsea BOP system, you must stop operations at a safe downhole location. Before resuming operations you must:

(1) Submit a revised permit with a verification report from a BAVO documenting the repairs and that the BOP is fit for service;

(2) Upon relatch of the BOP, perform an initial subsea BOP test in accordance with ยง 250.737(d)(4), including deadman. If repairs take longer than 30 days, once the BOP is on deck, you must test in accordance with the requirements of ยง 250.737; and

(3) Receive approval from the District Manager.

(c) If you plan to drill a new well with a subsea BOP, you do not need to submit with your APD the verifications required by this subpart for the open water drilling operation. Before drilling out the surface casing, you must submit for approval a revised APD, including the verifications required in this subpart.
