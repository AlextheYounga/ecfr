(a) No later than April 29, 2019, when conducting well operations with a subsea BOP or with a surface BOP on a floating facility, or when operating in an high pressure high temperature (HPHT) environment, you must gather and monitor real-time well data using an independent, automatic, and continuous monitoring system capable of recording, storing, and transmitting data regarding the following:

(1) The BOP control system;

(2) The well's fluid handling system on the rig; and

(3) The well's downhole conditions with the bottom hole assembly tools (if any tools are installed).

(b) You must transmit these data as they are gathered, barring unforeseeable or unpreventable interruptions in transmission, and have the capability to monitor the data onshore, using qualified personnel in accordance with a real-time monitoring plan, as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Onshore personnel who monitor real-time data must have the capability to contact rig personnel during operations. After operations, you must preserve and store these data onshore for recordkeeping purposes as required in §§ 250.740 and 250.741. You must provide BSEE with access to your designated real-time monitoring data onshore upon request. You must include in your APD a certification that you have a real-time monitoring plan that meets the criteria in paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) You must develop and implement a real-time monitoring plan. Your real-time monitoring plan, and all real-time monitoring data, must be made available to BSEE upon request. Your real-time monitoring plan must include the following:

(1) A description of your real-time monitoring capabilities, including the types of the data collected;

(2) A description of how your real-time monitoring data will be transmitted onshore during operations, how the data will be labeled and monitored by qualified onshore personnel, and how it will be stored onshore;

(3) A description of your procedures for providing BSEE access, upon request, to your real-time monitoring data including, if applicable, the location of any onshore data monitoring or data storage facilities;

(4) The qualifications of the onshore personnel monitoring the data;

(5) Your procedures for, and methods of, communication between rig personnel and the onshore monitoring personnel; and

(6) Actions to be taken if you lose any real-time monitoring capabilities or communications between rig and onshore personnel, and a protocol for how you will respond to any significant and/or prolonged interruption of monitoring or onshore-offshore communications, including your protocol for notifying BSEE of any significant and/or prolonged interruptions.
