##### § 203.71 How does BSEE allocate a field's suspension volume between my lease and other leases on my field? #####

The allocation depends on when production occurs, when we issued the lease, when we assigned it to the field, and whether we award the volume suspension by an approved application or establish it in the lease terms, as prescribed in this section.

(a) If your authorized field has an approved royalty suspension volume under §§ 203.67 and 203.69, we will suspend payment of royalties on production from all leases in the field that participate in the application until their cumulative production equals the approved volume. The following conditions also apply:

|     (3) We assign another lease that you operate to your field while we are evaluating your application,      |In our evaluation of your authorized field, we will take into account the value of any royalty relief the added lease already has under 30 CFR 560.114 or its lease document. If we find your authorized field still needs additional royalty suspension volume, that volume will be at least the combined royalty suspension volume to which all added leases on the field are entitled, or the minimum suspension volume of the authorized field, whichever is greater,|(i) You toll the time period for evaluation until you modify your application to be consistent with the newly constituted field;  <br/>(ii) We have an additional 60 days to review the new information; and  <br/>(iii) The assigned pre-Act lease or royalty suspension lease shares the royalty suspension we grant to the newly constituted field. An eligible lease does not share the royalty suspension we grant to the new field. If you do not agree to toll, we will have to reject your application due to incomplete information. Production from an assigned eligible lease counts toward the royalty suspension volume that we grant under § 203.69 for your authorized field, but you will not owe royalty on production from the eligible lease until it has produced the volume applicable under 30 CFR 560.114.|

If you (the original applicant) do not agree to toll, the other operator's lease retains any suspension volume it has or may share in any relief that we grant by filing the short form application specified in § 203.83 and authorized in § 203.82.                                                                                                                                   |

Moreover, past production from that well will count toward the royalty suspension volume applicable for the lease under 30 CFR 560.114 if the well is on an eligible lease or under 30 CFR 560.124 if the well is on a royalty suspension lease.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

(b) When a project has more than one lease, the royalty suspension volume for each lease equals that lease's actual production from the project (or production allocated under an approved unit agreement) until total production for all leases in the project equals the project's approved royalty suspension volume.

(c) You may receive a royalty-suspension volume only if your entire lease is west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes West longitude. If the field lies on both sides of this meridian, only leases located entirely west of the meridian will receive a royalty-suspension volume.
