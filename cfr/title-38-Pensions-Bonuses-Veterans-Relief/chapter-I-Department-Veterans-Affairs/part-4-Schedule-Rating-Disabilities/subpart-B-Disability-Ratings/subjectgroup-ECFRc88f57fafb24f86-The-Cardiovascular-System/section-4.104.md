When the level of METs at which breathlessness, fatigue, angina, dizziness, or syncope develops is required for evaluation, and a laboratory determination of METs by exercise testing cannot be done for medical reasons, a medical examiner may estimate the level of activity (expressed in METs and supported by specific examples, such as slow stair climbing or shoveling snow) that results in those symptoms.                                                                                         |      |

|Note (1): The ankle/brachial index (ABI) is the ratio of the systolic blood pressure at the ankle divided by the simultaneous brachial artery systolic blood pressure. For the purposes of this diagnostic code, normal ABI will be greater than or equal to 0.80. The ankle pressure (AP) is the systolic blood pressure measured at the ankle. Normal AP is greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg. The toe pressure (TP) is the systolic blood pressure measured at the great toe. Normal TP is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Transcutaneous oxygen tension (T<sub>c</sub> PO<sub>2</sub>) is measured at the first intercostal space on the foot. Normal T<sub>c</sub> PO<sub>2</sub> is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg. All measurements must be determined by objective testing.|      |

In all other cases, evaluate based on the test that provides the highest impairment value                                                                                                                                                                                   |      |

These evaluations are for the disease as a whole, regardless of the number of extremities involved or whether the nose and ears are involved.                                                                                                                                                                         |      |
