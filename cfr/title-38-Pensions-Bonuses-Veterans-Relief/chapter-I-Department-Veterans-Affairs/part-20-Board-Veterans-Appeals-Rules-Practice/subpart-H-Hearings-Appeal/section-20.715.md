##### ยง 20.715 Rule 715. Recording of hearing by appellant or representative. #####

An appellant or representative may record the hearing with his or her own equipment. Filming, videotaping or televising the hearing may only be authorized when prior written consent is obtained from all appellants and contesting claimants, if any, and made a matter of record. In no event will such additional equipment be used if it interferes with the conduct of the hearing or the official recording apparatus. In all such situations, advance arrangements must be made. In the case of hearings held before the Board of Veterans' Appeals in Washington, DC, arrangements must be made with the Director, Office of Management, Planning and Analysis (014), Board of Veterans' Appeals, P.O. Box 27063, Washington, DC 20038. In the case of hearings held before the Board at Department of Veterans Affairs field facilities, arrangements must be made through the office of the Department of Veterans Affairs official who signed the letter giving notification of the time and place of the hearing.
