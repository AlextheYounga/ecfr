##### ยง 20.1105 Rule 1105. New claim after promulgation of appellate decision. #####

When a claimant requests that a claim be reopened after an appellate decision has been promulgated and submits evidence in support thereof, a determination as to whether such evidence is new and material must be made and, if it is, as to whether it provides a basis for allowing the claim. An adverse determination as to either question is appealable.
