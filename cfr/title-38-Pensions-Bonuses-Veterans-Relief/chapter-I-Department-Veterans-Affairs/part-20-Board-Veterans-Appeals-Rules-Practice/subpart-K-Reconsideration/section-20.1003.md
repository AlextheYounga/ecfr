##### ยง 20.1003 Rule 1003. Hearings on reconsideration. #####

After a motion for reconsideration has been allowed, a hearing will be granted if an appellant requests a hearing before the Board. The hearing will be held by a Member or Members assigned to the reconsideration panel. A hearing will not normally be scheduled solely for the purpose of receiving argument by a representative. Such argument should be submitted in the form of a written brief. Oral argument may also be submitted on audio cassette for transcription for the record in accordance with Rule 700(d) (ยง 20.700(d) of this part). Requests for appearances by representatives alone to personally present argument to a Member or panel of Members of the Board may be granted if good cause is shown. Whether good cause has been shown will be determined by the presiding Member.
