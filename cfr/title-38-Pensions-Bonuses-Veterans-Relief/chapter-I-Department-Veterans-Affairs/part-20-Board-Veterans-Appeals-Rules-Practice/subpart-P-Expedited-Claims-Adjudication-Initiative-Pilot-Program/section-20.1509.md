##### ยง 20.1509 Rule 1509. Compliance and revocation of participation. #####

(a) Unless the participant revokes his or her participation in the Initiative as provided in paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of this section, all covered claims will continue to be processed by VA or the Board in accordance with the provisions of this subpart until a final decision of the agency of original jurisdiction or the Board has been issued.

(b) *Express revocation.* A participant may revoke participation in the Initiative at any time by submitting a revocation request in writing. The revocation request must be filed with the participating VA regional office unless the case has been certified and transferred to the Board, in which case the revocation request should be filed with the Board. As of the date of receipt of the revocation, any covered claims will be processed in the same manner as if the participant had not elected to participate in the Initiative.

(c) *Implied revocation.* The failure of a participant to meet the terms of these rules, as outlined in the executed Agreement and Waiver of Rights, will have the same result as if the participant had expressly revoked his or her participation in the Initiative. As of the date of the action constituting such implied revocation, any covered claims will be processed in the same manner as if the participant had not elected to participate in the Initiative. Grounds for implied revocation of participation include, but are not limited to:

(1) The failure of the participant or representative, as appropriate, to comply with any of the time limits set forth in ยง 20.1504(a) of this part;

(2) The failure to waive initial consideration by the agency of original jurisdiction of any evidence obtained by VA that was not considered in the Statement of the Case;

(3) A request by a participant or representative for an extension of any of the time limits set forth in ยง 20.1504(a) of this part, unless a motion for good cause is granted, as described by paragraph (e) of this section; and

(4) Any other failure on the part of the participant to comply with the terms of the Agreement and Waiver of Rights, as determined by VA.

(d) *Death of participant.* If a participant dies while his or her claim is being processed, participation in the Initiative will be deemed revoked.

(e) *Extensions.* Extensions of any of the time limits described in this subpart may only be granted when the participant demonstrates on motion that there is good cause for the extension request. At no time may time periods be extended beyond those provided by law to all claimants and appellants. Examples of good cause include, but are not limited to, illness of the participant or the representative of such severity that precludes action during the period; death of an individual representative; illness or incapacity of an individual representative that renders it impractical for a participant to continue with him or her as representative; or withdrawal of an individual representative. Motions for extensions must be filed prior to the expiration of the time period for which a motion is being requested. Motions must be in writing, and filed with the participating VA regional office that has jurisdiction over the claim, unless the case has been certified and transferred to the Board, in which case the motion must be filed with the Board. Motions must include the name of the participant, the applicable Department of Veterans Affairs file number; and an explanation as to why the extension request is being made.
