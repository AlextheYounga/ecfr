(2) The veteran's appeal rights, if any.

(c) *Adverse action.* An adverse action is one, other than an interim action such as a suspension of benefits pending development, which:

(1) Meet informally with a representative of VA;

(2) Review the basis for VA decision, including any relevant written documents or material; and
