(2) Assure that necessary services are provided by VA during the extended evaluation.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3106)

(b) *Assignment to extended evaluation* status. A veteran's case may be assigned or reassigned to *extended evaluation* status under provisions of § 21.57, § 21.74, § 21.86, § 21.94, § 21.96, or § 21.98.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3107)

(c) *Continuation in extended evaluation* status. A veteran's case will be in *extended evaluation* status during periods in which:

(1) The veteran is pending induction into the facility at which rehabilitation services will be provided;

(2) The veteran is receiving rehabilitation services prescribed in the IEEP (§ 21.86); or

(3) The veteran is on authorized leave of absence during an extended evaluation.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3108)

(d) *Termination of extended evaluation status.* A veteran in *extended evaluation* status will remain in that status until one of the following events occur:

(1) Following notification of necessary arrangements to begin an extended evaluation, the date the extended evaluation begins, and instructions as to the next steps to be taken, the veteran:

(i) Fails to report and does not respond to followup contact by the case manager;

(ii) Declines or refuses to enter the program; or

(iii) Defers induction for a period exceeding 30 days beyond the scheduled date of induction, except where the deferment is due to illness or other sufficient reason;

(2) VA determines the reasonable feasibility of a vocational goal for the veteran before completion of all of the planned evaluation because the decision does not require the further evaluation;

(3) The veteran completes the extended evaluation;

(4) Either the veteran or VA interrupts the extended evaluation;

(5) Either the veteran or VA discontinues the extended evaluation; or

(6) Service-connection for the veteran's service-connected disability is severed by VA or his or her continued eligibility otherwise ceases.
