<sup>1</sup> If an eligible person under 38 U.S.C. chapter 35 pursuing independent study on a less than one-half-time basis completes his or her program before the designated completion time, his or her award will be recomputed to permit payment of tuition and fees not to exceed $394.00 or $197.00, as appropriate, per month, if the maximum allowance is not initially authorized.

<sup>2</sup>See footnote 5 of ยง 21.4270(c) for measurement of full time and ยง 21.3132(c) for proportionate reduction in award for completion of less than 120 hours per month.

<sup>3</sup> Established charge means the charge for the course or courses determined on the basis of the lowest extended time payment plan offered by the institution and approved by the appropriate State approving agency or the actual cost to the eligible spouse or surviving spouse, whichever is less. VA considers the continuity of an enrollment broken when there are more than 6 months between the servicing of the lessons.
