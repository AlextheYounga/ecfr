##### ยง 74.27 How will VA store information? #####

VA intends to store records provided to complete the VetBiz Vendor Information Pages registration fully electronically on the Department's secure servers. CVE personnel will compare information provided concerning owners who have veteran status, service-disabled veteran status or surviving spouse status against electronic records maintained by the Department's Veterans Benefits Administration. Records collected during examination visits will be scanned onto portable media and fully secured in the Center for Veterans Enterprise, located in Washington, DC.
