##### ยง 74.15 What length of time may a business participate in VetBiz VIP Verification Program? #####

(a) A participant receives an eligibility term of 3 years from the date of CVE's approval letter establishing verified status. The participant must maintain its eligibility during its tenure and must inform CVE of any changes that would adversely affect its eligibility. The eligibility term may be shortened by cancellation by CVE or voluntary withdrawal by the participant (*i.e.*, no longer eligible as a small business concern), as provided for in this subpart.

(b) When at least 50 percent of the assets of a concern are the same as those of an affiliated business, the concern will not be eligible for verification.

(c) CVE may initiate a verification examination whenever it receives credible information calling into the question a participant's eligibility as a VOSB. Upon its completion of the examination, CVE will issue a written decision regarding the continued eligibility status of the questioned participant.

(d) If CVE finds that the participant does not qualify as a VOSB, the procedures at ยง 74.22 will apply.

(e) If CVE finds that the participant continues to qualify as a VOSB, the program term remains in effect.
