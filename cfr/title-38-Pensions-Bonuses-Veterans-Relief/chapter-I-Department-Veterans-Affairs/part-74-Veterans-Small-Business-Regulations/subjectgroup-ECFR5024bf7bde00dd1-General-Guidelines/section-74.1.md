For the purposes of part 74, the following definitions apply.

*Center for Veterans Enterprise* (CVE) is an office within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and is a subdivision of VA's Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization.

It also helps VA contracting offices identify veteran-owned small businesses and works with the Small Business Administration's Veterans Business Development Officers and Small Business Development Centers nationwide regarding veterans' business financing, management, and technical assistance needs.

*Days* are calendar days. In computing any period of time described in part 74, the day from which the period begins to run is not counted, and when the last day of the period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the period extends to the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Similarly, in circumstances where CVE is closed for all or part of the last day, the period extends to the next day on which the agency is open.

*Day-to-day management* means supervising the executive team, formulating sound policies and setting strategic direction.

*Day-to-day operations* mean the marketing, production, sales, and administrative functions of the firm.

In addition, some businesses may be owned and operated by an eligible surviving spouse. Reservists or members of the National Guard disabled from a disease or injury incurred or aggravated in line of duty or while in training status also qualify.

*Small business concern* is - CVE applies the small business concern definition established by 48 CFR 2.101.
