Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 178, Jan. 18, 2019.

Following receipt of a timely Substantive Appeal, the agency of original jurisdiction will certify the case to the Board of Veterans' Appeals. Certification is accomplished by the completion of VA Form 8, “Certification of Appeal.” The certification is used for administrative purposes and does not serve to either confer or deprive the Board of Veterans' Appeals of jurisdiction over an issue.
