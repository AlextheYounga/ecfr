(d) *Grant is not a course buyout.* The grant funds shall not be used to substitute a class that an instructor is required to teach during an academic year.

(e) *Matching requirement.* VA will determine whether a grantee must provide matching funds as a condition of receiving a VLGP grant as set forth in the NOFA.
