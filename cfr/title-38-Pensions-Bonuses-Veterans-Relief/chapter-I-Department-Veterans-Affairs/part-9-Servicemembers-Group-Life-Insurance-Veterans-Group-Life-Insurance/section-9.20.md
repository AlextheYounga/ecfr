##### § 9.20 Traumatic injury protection. #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 15910, Mar. 15, 2023.

(a) *What is traumatic injury protection?* Traumatic injury protection provides for the payment of a specified benefit amount to a member insured by Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance who sustains a traumatic injury directly resulting in a scheduled loss.

(b) *What is a traumatic event?* (1) A traumatic event is the application of external force, violence, chemical, biological, or radiological weapons, or accidental ingestion of a contaminated substance causing damage to a living being occurring on or after October 7, 2001.

(2) A traumatic event does not include a medical or surgical procedure in and of itself.

(c) *What is a traumatic injury?* (1) A traumatic injury is physical damage to a living body that is caused by a traumatic event as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) For purposes of this section, the term “traumatic injury” does not include damage to a living body caused by—

(i) A mental disorder; or

(ii) A mental or physical illness or disease, except if the physical illness or disease is caused by a pyogenic infection, biological, chemical, or radiological weapons, or accidental ingestion of a contaminated substance.

(3) For purposes of this section, all traumatic injuries will be considered to have occurred at the same time as the traumatic event.

(d) *What are the eligibility requirements for payment of traumatic injury protection benefits?* You must meet all of the following requirements in order to be eligible for traumatic injury protection benefits.

(1) You must be a member of the uniformed services who is insured by Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance under section 1967(a)(1)(A)(i), (B) or (C)(i) of title 38, United States Code, on the date you sustained a traumatic injury, except if you are a member who experienced a traumatic injury on or after October 7, 2001, through and including November 30, 2005. (For this purpose, you will be considered a member of the uniformed services until midnight on the date of termination of your duty status in the uniformed services that established your eligibility for Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, notwithstanding an extension of your Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance coverage under section 1968(a) of title 38, United States Code.)

(2) You must suffer a scheduled loss that is a direct result of a traumatic injury and no other cause.

(3) You must survive for a period not less than seven full days from the date of the traumatic injury. The seven day period begins on the date and Zulu (Greenwich Meridean) time of the traumatic injury and ends 168 full hours later.

(4) You must suffer a scheduled loss under paragraph (e)(7) of this section within two years of the traumatic injury.

(5) You must suffer a traumatic injury before midnight on the date of termination of your duty status in the uniformed services that established eligibility for Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance. For purposes of this section, the scheduled loss may occur after the date of termination of your duty status in the uniformed services that established eligibility for Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance.

(e) *What is a scheduled loss and what amount will be paid because of that loss?* (1) The term “scheduled loss” means a condition listed in the schedule in paragraph (e)(7) of this section if directly caused by a traumatic injury. A scheduled loss is payable at the amount specified in the schedule.

(2) The maximum amount payable under the schedule for all losses resulting from traumatic events occurring within a seven-day period is $100,000. We will calculate the seven-day period beginning with the day on which the first traumatic event occurs.

(3) A benefit will not be paid if a scheduled loss is due to a traumatic injury—

(i) Caused by—

(A) The member's attempted suicide, while sane or insane;

(B) An intentionally self-inflicted injury or an attempt to inflict such injury;

(C) Diagnostic procedures, preventive medical procedures such as inoculations, medical or surgical treatment for an illness or disease, or any complications arising from such procedures or treatment;

(D) Willful use of an illegal substance or a controlled substance unless administered or consumed on the advice of a medical professional; or

(ii) Sustained while a member was committing or attempting to commit a felony.

(4) A benefit will not be paid for a scheduled loss resulting from—

(i) A physical or mental illness or disease, whether or not caused by a traumatic injury, other than a pyogenic infection or physical illness or disease caused by biological, chemical, or radiological weapons or accidental ingestion of a contaminated substance; or

(ii) A mental disorder whether or not caused by a traumatic injury.

(5) Amount Payable under the Schedule of Losses. (i) The maximum amount payable for all scheduled losses resulting from a single traumatic event is limited to $100,000. For example, if a traumatic event on April 1, 2006, results in the immediate total and permanent loss of sight in both eyes, and the loss of one foot on May 1, 2006, as a direct result of the same traumatic event, the member will be paid $100,000.

(ii) If a member suffers more than one scheduled loss from separate traumatic events occurring more than seven full days apart, the scheduled losses will be considered separately and a benefit will be paid for each loss up to the maximum amount according to the schedule. For example, if a member suffers the loss of one foot at or above the ankle on May 1, 2006, from one event, the member will be paid $50,000. If the same member suffers loss of sight in both eyes from an event that occurred on November 1, 2006, the member will be paid an additional $100,000.

(g) *Who will determine eligibility for traumatic injury protection benefits?* Each uniformed service will certify its own members for traumatic injury protection benefits based upon section 1032 of Public Law 109-13, section 501 of Public Law 109-233, and this section. The uniformed service will certify whether you were at the time of the traumatic injury insured under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance and whether you have sustained a qualifying loss.

(h) *How does a member make a claim for traumatic injury protection benefits?* (1)(i) A member who believes he or she qualifies for traumatic injury protection benefits must complete Part A of the Application for TSGLI Benefits Form and sign the form.

(ii) If a member is unable to sign the Application for TSGLI Benefits Form due to the member's physical or mental incapacity, the form must be signed by the member's guardian; if none, the member's agent or attorney acting under a valid Power of Attorney; if none, the member's military trustee.

(iii) If a member suffered a scheduled loss as a direct result of the traumatic injury, survived seven full days from the date of the traumatic event, and then died before the maximum benefit for which the service member qualifies is paid, the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the member's Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance policy should complete an Application for TSGLI Benefits Form.

(2) If a member seeks traumatic injury protection benefits for a scheduled loss occurring after submission of a completed Application for TSGLI Benefits Form for a different scheduled loss, the member must submit a completed Application for TSGLI Benefits Form for the new scheduled loss and for each scheduled loss that occurs thereafter and for each increment of a scheduled loss that occurs thereafter. For example, if a member seeks traumatic injury protection benefits for a scheduled loss due to coma from traumatic injury and/or the inability to carry out activities of daily living due to traumatic brain injury (§ 9.20(f)(17)), or the inability to carry out activities of daily living due to loss directly resulting from a traumatic injury other than an injury to the brain (§ 9.20(f)(19)), a completed Application for TSGLI Benefits Form must be submitted for each increment of time for which TSGLI is payable. Also, for example, if a service member suffers a scheduled loss due to a coma, a completed Application for TSGLI Benefits Form should be filed after the 15th consecutive day that the member is in the coma, for which $25,000 is payable. If the member remains in a coma for another 15 days, another completed Application for TSGLI Benefits Form should be submitted and another $25,000 will be paid.

(i) *How does a member or beneficiary appeal an adverse eligibility determination?* (1) Notice of a decision regarding a member's eligibility for traumatic injury protection benefits will include an explanation of the procedure for obtaining review of the decision. An appeal of an eligibility determination, such as whether the loss occurred within 365 days of the traumatic injury, whether the injury was self-inflicted or whether a loss of hearing was total and permanent, must be in writing. An appeal must be submitted by a member or a member's legal representative or by the beneficiary or the beneficiary's legal representative, within one year of the date of a denial of eligibility, to the office of the uniformed service identified in the decision regarding the member's eligibility for the benefit.

(2) An appeal regarding whether a member was insured under Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance when the traumatic injury was sustained must be in writing. An appeal must be submitted by a member or a member's legal representative or by the beneficiary or the beneficiary's legal representative within one year of the date of a denial of eligibility to the Office of Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance.

(3) Nothing in this section precludes a member from pursuing legal remedies under 38 U.S.C. 1975 and 38 CFR 9.13.

(j) *Who will be paid the traumatic injury protection benefit?* The injured member who suffered a scheduled loss will be paid the traumatic injury protection benefit in accordance with title 38 U.S.C. 1980A except under the following circumstances:

(1) If a member is legally incapacitated, the member's guardian or agent or attorney acting under a valid Power of Attorney will be paid the benefit on behalf of the member.

(2) If no guardian, agent, or attorney is authorized to act as the member's legal representative, a military trustee who has been appointed under the authority of 37 U.S.C. 602 will be paid the benefit on behalf of the member. The military trustee will report the receipt of the traumatic injury benefit payment and any disbursements from that payment to the Department of Defense.

(3) If a member dies before payment is made, the beneficiary or beneficiaries who will be paid the benefit will be determined in accordance with 38 U.S.C. 1970(a).

(k) The Traumatic Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance program will be administered in accordance with this rule, except to the extent that any regulatory provision is inconsistent with subsequently enacted applicable law.
