##### ยง 13.64 Fiduciary commissions. #####

Generally, a VA appointed fiduciary is to be encouraged to serve without fee.

(a) *Authority.* The Veterans Service Center Manager is authorized to determine when a commission is necessary in order to obtain the services of a fiduciary, except that the Veterans Service Center Manager may not authorize a commission to a fiduciary who receives any other form of remuneration or payment in connection with rendering fiduciary services on behalf of the beneficiary. Necessity is established only if the beneficiary's best interest would be served by the appointment of a qualified professional, or, if a qualified professional is not available, the proposed fiduciary is the only qualified person available and is not willing to serve without a fee.

(b) *Amount; notice to beneficiary.* The Veterans Service Center Manager shall authorize a fiduciary to whom a commission is payable under paragraph (a) of this section to deduct from the beneficiary's estate a reasonable commission for fiduciary services rendered. The commission for any year may not exceed 4 percent of the monetary benefits paid by VA on behalf of the beneficiary to the fiduciary during that year; a year being the normal 12 month period following the anniversary date of appointment. The Veterans Service Center Manager shall furnish appropriate notice to the beneficiary, either directly or through the fiduciary, that a commission is payable.

(c) *Persons who may be excluded.* Commissions may not be authorized to dependents of the beneficiary or other close relatives acting in a fiduciary capacity on behalf of the beneficiary, except under extraordinary circumstances.
