##### ยง 13.69 Limitation of beneficiaries to individual fiduciary. #####

For purposes of payment of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits, the number of beneficiaries for whom an individual fiduciary may act will be limited to the number the fiduciary may be reasonably expected to properly serve. When, in the judgment of the Veterans Service Center Manager, a fiduciary has been appointed or is seeking appointment in a case in excess of that number, the Veterans Service Center Manager will initiate action to obtain a suitable substitute fiduciary.
