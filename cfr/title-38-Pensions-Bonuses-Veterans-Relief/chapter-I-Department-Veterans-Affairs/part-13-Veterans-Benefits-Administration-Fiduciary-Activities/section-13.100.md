##### ยง 13.100 Supervision of fiduciaries. #####

(a) *Federal fiduciaries.* In Federal fiduciary cases, the Veterans Service Center Manager may, when he or she deems it necessary for the protection of the beneficiary's interests:

(1) Require an accounting, formal or informal, of Department of Veterans Affairs benefits paid.

(2) Terminate the appointment of a Federal fiduciary and appoint a successor Federal fiduciary.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5502)

(b) *Court-appointed fiduciaries.* In court-appointed fiduciary cases, the Veterans Service Center Manager will take such informal action as may be necessary to assure that the needs of the beneficiary are provided for and Department of Veterans Affairs benefits are prudently administered and adequately protected.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

(c) *Unsatisfactory conditions.* In any case where a fiduciary fails to render a satisfactory account or has collected or paid, or is attempting to collect or pay, fees, commissions, or allowances that are illegal or inequitable or in excess of those allowed by law, or has failed to use Department of Veterans Affairs funds for the benefit of the beneficiary or the beneficiary's dependents, or has otherwise failed or neglected to properly execute the duties of his or her trust, and informal efforts by the Veterans Service Center Manager to correct the situation prove unsuccessful, the case will be referred to the Regional Counsel. In such cases the Veterans Service Center Manager may have all Department of Veterans Affairs benefits suspended.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5502)

(d) *Misappropriation, embezzlement or violation of Federal statutes.* When the evidence indicates a prima facie case of misappropriation, embezzlement or violation of the Federal statutes, the matter will be submitted to the Regional Counsel for review and, if appropriate, the Regional Counsel's referral to the U.S. Attorney.
