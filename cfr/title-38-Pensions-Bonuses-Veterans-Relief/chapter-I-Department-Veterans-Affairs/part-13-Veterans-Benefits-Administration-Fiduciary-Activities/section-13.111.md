##### ยง 13.111 Claims of creditors. #####

Under 38 U.S.C. 5301(a), payments made to or on account of a beneficiary under any of the laws relating to veterans are exempt, either before or after receipt by the beneficiary, from the claims of creditors and State and local taxation. The fiduciary should invoke this defense where applicable. If the fiduciary does not do so, the Veterans Service Center Manager should refer the matter to the Regional Counsel for appropriate action.
