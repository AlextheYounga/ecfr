(a) *Federal fiduciaries.* (1) The Veterans Service Center Manager may require a legal custodian, custodian-in-fact or chief officer of a private institution recognized to administer Department of Veterans Affairs benefits on behalf of a beneficiary, to furnish a corporate surety bond in an amount determined to be sufficient to protect the interest of the beneficiary. Such bond shall run to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the use and benefit of the beneficiary.

(2) The Veterans Service Center Manager may require a legal custodian to furnish an agreement in lieu of a surety bond or additional surety bond when funds are deposited in an interest or dividend-paying account in a State or federally insured institution. The agreement will provide that the legal custodian and institution agree that all funds received from the Department of Veterans Affairs on behalf of the beneficiary, which have been or will be deposited by the legal custodian in the account, will be withdrawn only with the written consent of the Veterans Service Center Manager or designee.

(b) *Substitution of surety; claims against defunct companies.* If any surety company is placed in receivership or ceases to do business in the particular State, the Veterans Service Center Manager will take the necessary action to have proper bonds substituted in Federal fiduciary cases and refer the matter to the Regional Counsel for such other action as may be appropriate.
