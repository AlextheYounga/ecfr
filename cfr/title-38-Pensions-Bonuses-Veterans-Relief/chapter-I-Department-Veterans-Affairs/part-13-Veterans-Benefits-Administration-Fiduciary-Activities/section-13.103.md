(c) *Pre-need burial arrangements.* Federally appointed fiduciaries, other than institutional award payees, may use a beneficiary's funds derived from VA benefits to make deposits into, or purchase, a pre-need burial plan or burial insurance on behalf of the beneficiary, if to do so is in the beneficiary's interest.
