##### § 1.476 Prohibition on redisclosure. #####

Each disclosure under §§ 1.460 through 1.499 of this part made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by a written statement similar to the following:

This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by Federal confidentiality rules (38 CFR Part 1). The Federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of this information unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by 38 CFR Part 1. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is NOT sufficient for this purpose. The Federal rules restrict any use of the information to criminally investigate or prosecute any alcohol or drug abuse patient or patient with sickle cell anemia or HIV infection.
