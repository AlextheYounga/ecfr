Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 46298, July 31, 2020.

(a) *Revocation by the Family Caregiver.* The Family Caregiver may request a revocation of caregiver status in writing and provide the present or future date of revocation. All caregiver benefits will continue to be provided to the Family Caregiver until the date of revocation. VA will, if requested and applicable, assist the Family Caregiver in transitioning to alternative health care coverage and mental health services. VA will notify the eligible veteran verbally and in writing of the request for revocation.

(b) *Revocation by the eligible veteran or surrogate.* The eligible veteran or the eligible veteran's surrogate may initiate revocation of a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver.

(1) The revocation request must be in writing and must express an intent to remove the Family Caregiver.

(2) VA will notify the Family Caregiver verbally and in writing of the request for revocation.

(3) VA will review the request for revocation and determine whether there is a possibility for remediation. This review will take no longer than 30 days. During such review, the eligible veteran or surrogate may rescind the request for revocation. If VA suspects that the safety of the eligible veteran is at risk, then VA may suspend the caregiver's responsibilities, and remove the eligible veteran from the home if requested by the eligible veteran, or take other appropriate action to ensure the welfare of the eligible veteran, prior to making a formal revocation.

(4) Caregiver benefits will continue for 30 days after the date of revocation, and VA will, if requested by the Family Caregiver, assist the individual with transitioning to alternative health care coverage and mental health services, unless one of the following is true:

(i) VA determines that the Family Caregiver committed fraud or abused or neglected the eligible veteran, in which case benefits will terminate immediately.

(ii) If the revoked individual was the Primary Family Caregiver, and another Primary Family Caregiver is designated within 30 days after the date of revocation, in which case benefits for the revoked Primary Family Caregiver will terminate the day before the date the new Primary Family Caregiver is designated.

(iii) If another individual is designated to be a Family Caregiver within 30 days after the date of revocation, such that there are three Family Caregivers assigned to the eligible veteran, in which case benefits for the revoked Family Caregiver will terminate the day before the date the new Family Caregiver is designated.

(iv) The revoked individual had been living with the eligible veteran and moves out, or the revoked individual abandons or terminates his or her relationship with the eligible veteran, in which case benefits will terminate immediately.

(c) *Revocation by VA.* VA may immediately revoke the designation of a Family Caregiver if the eligible veteran or individual designated as a Family Caregiver no longer meets the requirements of this part, or if VA makes the clinical determination that having the Family Caregiver is no longer in the best interest of the eligible veteran. VA will, if requested by the Family Caregiver, assist him or her in transitioning to alternative health care coverage and mental health services. If revocation is due to improvement in the eligible veteran's condition, death, or permanent institutionalization, the Family Caregiver will continue to receive caregiver benefits for 90 days, unless any of the conditions described in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section apply, in which case benefits will terminate as specified. In addition, bereavement counseling may be available under 38 U.S.C. 1783. If VA suspects that the safety of the eligible veteran is at risk, then VA may suspend the caregiver's responsibilities, and remove the eligible veteran from the home if requested by the eligible veteran or take other appropriate action to ensure the welfare of the eligible veteran, prior to making a formal revocation.
