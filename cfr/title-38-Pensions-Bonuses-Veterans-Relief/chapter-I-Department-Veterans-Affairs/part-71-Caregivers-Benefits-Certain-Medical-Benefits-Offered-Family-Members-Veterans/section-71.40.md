(a) *General Caregiver benefits.* VA will provide to General Caregivers all of the benefits listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (4) of this section.

(1) Continued instruction, preparation, training, and technical support. Caregivers will have access to each of the following services, which may be provided through:

(i) Online and in-person educational sessions.

(ii) Use of telehealth and other available technologies.

(iii) Teaching techniques, strategies, and skills for caring for the eligible or covered veteran.

(2) Information concerning the supportive services available to caregivers under paragraph (a) of this section and other public, private, and nonprofit agencies that offer support to caregivers.

(3) Counseling and other services, as described under § 71.50.

(4) Respite care to eligible and covered veterans in support of the caregiver that is medically and age appropriate for the eligible or covered veteran (including 24-hour per day in-home respite care).

(b) *Secondary Family Caregiver benefits.* VA will provide to Secondary Family Caregivers all of the benefits listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.

(1) General Caregiver benefits described in paragraph (a) of this section, except that respite care under paragraph (a)(4) is limited to veterans enrolled in the VA health care system. Respite care may be provided during a Family Caregiver's training, as described under § 71.25(d).

(2) The primary care team will maintain the eligible veteran's treatment plan and collaborate with clinical staff making home visits to monitor the eligible veteran's well-being, adequacy of care and supervision being provided. This monitoring will occur no less often than every 90 days, unless otherwise clinically indicated, and will include an evaluation of the overall health and well-being of the eligible veteran.

(3) Continuing instruction, preparation, and training to maintain or improve the personal care services provided to the eligible veteran.

(4) Ongoing technical support, consisting of information and assistance to address, in a timely manner, the routine, emergency, and specialized needs of the caregiver in providing personal care services to the eligible veteran.

(5) Counseling, which for the purposes of paragraph (b) of this section includes individual and group therapy, individual counseling, and peer support groups. Counseling does not include the provision of medication, inpatient psychiatric care, or other medical procedures related to mental health treatment. Counseling does not have to be in connection with the treatment of a disability for which the eligible veteran is receiving treatment from VA.

(6) Primary and Secondary Family Caregivers are eligible for beneficiary travel under 38 CFR part 70 if the eligible veteran is eligible for beneficiary travel under 38 CFR part 70.

(c) *Primary Family Caregiver benefits.* VA will provide to Primary Family Caregivers all of the benefits listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section.

(1) Secondary Family Caregiver benefits, as listed under paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) Respite care includes 24-hour-per day care of the eligible veteran commensurate with the care provided by the Family Caregiver to permit extended respite. Respite care will be available for at least 30 days per year and may exceed 30 days per year if clinically appropriate and if requested by the Primary Family Caregiver. Respite care provided shall be medically and age-appropriate and include in-home care.

(3) Primary Family Caregivers are eligible for enrollment in the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 1781, unless they are entitled to care or services under a health-plan contract (as defined in 38 U.S.C. 1725(f)).

(4) Primary Family Caregivers will receive a monthly stipend for each prior month's participation as a Primary Family caregiver. To determine the stipend amount, VA first will determine the eligible veteran's level of dependency based on the degree to which the eligible veteran is unable to perform one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), or the degree to which the eligible veteran is in need of supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury, as follows:

(i) VA will clinically rate the eligible veteran's inability to perform each of the seven ADLs listed in the definition of that term in § 71.15.

(ii) VA will clinically rate the eligible veteran's need for supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury using the seven impairments listed in the definition of that term in § 71.15.

(iii) Clinical ratings under paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section will be scored as follows: VA will assign a zero if the eligible veteran completes the task/activity without assistance; one if the eligible veteran requires minimal assistance (can complete 75 percent or more of the task without supervision or assistance); two if the eligible veteran requires moderate assistance (can complete 50 percent to 74 percent of the task without assistance); three if the eligible veteran requires maximal assistance (can complete 25 percent to 49 percent of the task without assistance); or four if the eligible veteran requires total assistance (can complete less than 25 percent of the task or is unable to do the task without assistance).

(iv) If the sum of all of the ratings assigned is:

(A) 21 or higher, then the caregiver will receive a stipend equivalent to the eligible veteran requiring 40 hours per week of caregiverassistance.

(B) 13 to 20, then the caregiver will receive a stipend equivalent to the eligible veteran requiring 25 hours per week of caregiver assistance.

(C) 1 to 12, then the caregiver will receive a stipend equivalent to the eligible veteran requiring 10 hours per week of caregiver assistance.

(v) The monthly stipend payment will be calculated by multiplying the combined rate by the number of weekly hours of caregiverassistance required under paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section. This product will then be multiplied by 4.35.

(vi) Stipend payments for the first month will be adjusted based on the number of days remaining in the month. Stipend payments will also be prorated where a Primary Family Caregiver's status is revoked and/or a new Primary Family Caregiver is designated prior to the end of a month. *See* § 71.45, Revocation.

(vii) Nothing in this section shall be construed to create an employment relationship between the Secretary and an individual in receipt of assistance or support under this part.

(d) *Effective date and payment date of benefits* - (1) *Effective date.* Caregiver benefits are effective as of the date that the signed joint application is received by VA or the date on which the eligible veteran begins receiving care at home, whichever is later. However, benefits will not be provided until the individual is designated as a Family Caregiver. Individuals who apply to be Family Caregivers must complete all necessary education, instruction, and training so that VA can complete the designation process no later than 45 days after the date that the joint application was submitted or, if the application has been placed on hold for a GAF assessment, 45 days after the hold has been lifted, or a new joint application will be required to serve as the date of application for payment purposes. VA may extend the 45-day period for up to 90 days after the date the joint application was submitted or, if the application has been placed on hold for a GAF assessment, for up to 90 days after the hold has been lifted. Such an extension may either be based on training identified under § 71.25(d) that is still pending completion, or hospitalization of the eligible veteran.

(2) *Payment date.* The stipend is paid monthly for personal care services that the Primary Family Caregiver provided in the prior month. Benefits due prior to such designation, based on the date of application, will be paid retroactive to the date that the joint application is received by VA or the date on which the eligible veteran begins receiving care at home, whichever is later.
