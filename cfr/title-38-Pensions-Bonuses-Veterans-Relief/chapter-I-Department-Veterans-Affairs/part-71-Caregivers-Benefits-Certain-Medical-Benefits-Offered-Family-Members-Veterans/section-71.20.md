Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 46295, July 31, 2020.

A veteran or servicemember is eligible for a Primary or Secondary Family Caregiver under this part if she or he meets all of the following requirements:

(a) The individual is either:

(1) A veteran; or

(2) A member of the Armed Forces undergoing a medical discharge from the Armed Forces.

(b) The individual has a serious injury, including traumatic brain injury, psychological trauma, or other mental disorder, incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service on or after September 11, 2001.

(c) Such serious injury renders the individual in need of personal care services for a minimum of 6 continuous months (based on a clinical determination authorized by the individual's primary care team), based on any one of the following clinical criteria:

(1) An inability to perform an activity of daily living.

(2) A need for supervision or protection based on symptoms or residuals of neurological or other impairment or injury, including traumatic brain injury.

(3) Psychological trauma or a mental disorder that has been scored, by a licensed mental health professional, with Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) test scores of 30 or less, continuously during the 90-day period immediately preceding the date on which VA initially received the caregiver application. VA will consider a GAF score to be “continuous” if there are at least two scores during the 90-day period (one that shows a GAF score of 30 or less at the beginning of the 90-day period and one that shows a GAF score of 30 or less at the end of the 90-day period) and there are no intervening GAF scores of more than 30.

(4) The veteran is service connected for a serious injury that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty in the active military, naval, or air service on or after September 11, 2001, and has been rated 100 percent disabled for that serious injury, and has been awarded special monthly compensation that includes an aid and attendance allowance.

(d) A clinical determination (authorized by the individual's primary care team) has been made that it is in the best interest of the individual to participate in the program.

(e) Personal care services that would be provided by the Family Caregiver will not be simultaneously and regularly provided by or through another individual or entity.

(f) The individual agrees to receive care at home after VA designates a Family Caregiver.

(g) The individual agrees to receive ongoing care from a primary care team after VA designates a Family Caregiver.
