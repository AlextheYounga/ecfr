Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 32738, July 13, 2018.

(a) When an incompetent veteran entitled to pension, compensation or retirement pay is a patient in a hospital or other institution, payments on his (or her) account may be made to the chief officer of a Department of Veterans Affairs or non-Department of Veterans Affairs institution:

(1) When no fiduciary has been appointed or when payments to an unsatisfactory fiduciary have been discontinued;

(2) When the Veterans Service Center Manager certifies that a fiduciary is not furnishing the chief officer funds required for the veteran's comforts and desires not otherwise provided by the institution.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501(a); 5307; 5502)

(b) In an institutional award of pension, compensation or retirement pay there may be paid to the chief officer of a non-Department of Veterans Affairs institution on behalf of the veteran an amount not in excess of $60 per month. An institutional award of disability pension will not exceed $25 per month if the award is apportionable under § 3.454(a).

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)

(1) All sums, otherwise payable in excess of the institutional award, apportionments or awards to fiduciaries, will be deposited in Personal Funds of Patients.

(2) There may be paid on behalf of a veteran, having no spouse, child or dependent parent and receiving care in a non-Department of Veterans Affairs institution, such additional amount, within the limit of the total payable and as may be certified by the Veterans Service Center Manager, needed for the benefit of the veteran and to pay for his (or her) care and maintenance. Moneys on deposit in Personal Funds of Patients will not be used for this purpose except as authorized by the Veterans Service Center Manager under § 13.72 of this chapter.

(3) If the veteran has dependents, or more is payable under his (or her) rating, or there are funds to his (or her) credit in “Funds Due Incompetent Beneficiaries,” such additional amount as may be needed will be allowed on the basis of a certification by the chief officer with respect to need and amount required.

(c) Where there arises a situation as enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, apportionment to dependents will be under § 3.451.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5307)

(d) Any excess funds held by the chief officer of a non-Department of Veterans Affairs institution, not necessary for the benefit of the veteran, will be returned to the Department of Veterans Affairs or to a fiduciary, if one is serving. Upon death of a veteran with no surviving heirs, excess funds will be returned to the Department of Veterans Affairs.
