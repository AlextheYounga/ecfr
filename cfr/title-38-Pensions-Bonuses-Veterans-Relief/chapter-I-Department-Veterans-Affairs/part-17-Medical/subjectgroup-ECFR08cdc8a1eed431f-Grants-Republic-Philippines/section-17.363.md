##### ยง 17.363 Length of stay. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 29449, June 25, 2018.

In computing the length of stay for which payment will be made, the day of admission will be counted, but not the day of discharge, death, or transfer. Where a veteran for whom hospitalization has been authorized in Veterans Memorial Medical Center or a contract facility, is absent from the hospital for a period longer than 24 hours, no payment will be made for hospital care during that absence.
