##### § 17.363 Length of stay. #####

In computing the length of stay for which payment will be made, the day of admission will be counted, but not the day of discharge, death, or transfer. Where a veteran for whom hospitalization has been authorized in Veterans Memorial Medical Center or a contract facility, is absent from the hospital for a period longer than 24 hours, no payment will be made for hospital care during that absence.
