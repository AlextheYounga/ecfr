##### ยง 17.352 Amounts and use of grant funds for the replacement and upgrading of equipment. #####

Grants awarded under ยง 17.351 shall not exceed the amounts provided by the appropriation acts of the Congress of the United States for the purpose. Funds appropriated for the upgrading and replacement of equipment at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, or for rehabilitating its equipment, shall remain available in consecutive fiscal years until expanded, but in no event shall exceed the amount of $500,000 per year. It is not intended that such funds will be utilized to expand the medical center facilities. Upgrading of equipment, however, would permit purchase of new and additional equipment not now possessed by the medical center.
