##### § 17.86 Provision of hospital care and medical services during certain disasters and emergencies under 38 U.S.C. 1785. #####

(a) This section sets forth regulations regarding the provision of hospital care and medical services under 38 U.S.C. 1785.

(b) During and immediately following a disaster or emergency referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, VA under 38 U.S.C. 1785 may furnish hospital care and medical services to individuals (including those who otherwise do not have VA eligibility for such care and services) responding to, involved in, or otherwise affected by that disaster or emergency.

(c) For purposes of this section, a *disaster* or *emergency* means:

(1) A major disaster or emergency declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 *et seq.*) (Stafford Act); or

(2) A disaster or emergency in which the National Disaster Medical System established pursuant to section 2811(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300hh-11(b)) is activated either by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under paragraph (3)(A) of that section or as otherwise authorized by law.

(d) For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the terms *hospital care* and *medical services* have the meanings given such terms by 38 U.S.C. 1701(5) and 1701(6).

(e) Unless the cost of care is charged at rates agreed upon in a sharing agreement as described in § 17.102(e), the cost of hospital care and medical services provided under this section to an officer or employee of a department or agency of the United States (other than VA) or to a member of the Armed Forces shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 17.102(c) and (h). Other individuals who receive hospital care or medical services under this section are responsible for the cost of the hospital care or medical services when charges are mandated by Federal law (including applicable appropriation acts) or when the cost of care or services is not reimbursed by other-than-VA Federal departments or agencies. When individuals are responsible under this section for the cost of hospital care or medical services, VA will bill in the amounts calculated in accordance with the provisions of § 17.102(h), without applying the exception provided in the first paragraph of § 17.102.

(f) VA may furnish care and services under this section to a veteran without regard to whether that individual is enrolled in the VA healthcare system under 38 U.S.C. 1705 and § 17.36 of this part.
