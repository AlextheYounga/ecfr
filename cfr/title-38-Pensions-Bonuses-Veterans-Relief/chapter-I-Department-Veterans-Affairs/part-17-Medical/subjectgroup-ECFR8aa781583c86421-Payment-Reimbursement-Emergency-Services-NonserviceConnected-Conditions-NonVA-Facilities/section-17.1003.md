##### ยง 17.1003 Emergency transportation. #####

Notwithstanding the provisions of ยง 17.1002, payment or reimbursement under 38 U.S.C. 1725 for ambulance services, including air ambulance services, may be made for transporting a veteran to a facility only if the following conditions are met:

(a) Payment or reimbursement is authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1725 for emergency treatment provided at such facility (or payment or reimbursement could have been authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1725 for emergency treatment if death had not occurred before emergency treatment could be provided);

(b) The veteran is financially liable to the provider of the emergency transportation;

(c) The veteran has no coverage under a health-plan contract for reimbursement or payment, in whole or in part, for the emergency transportation or any emergency treatment authorized under 38 U.S.C. 1728 (this condition is not met if the veteran has coverage under a health-plan contract but payment is barred because of a failure by the veteran or the provider to comply with the provisions of that health-plan contract); and

(d) If the condition for which the emergency transportation was furnished was caused by an accident or work-related injury, the claimant has exhausted without success all claims and remedies reasonably available to the veteran or provider against a third party for payment of such transportation; and the veteran has no contractual or legal recourse against a third party that could reasonably be pursued for the purpose of extinguishing, in whole or in part, the veteran's liability to the provider.
