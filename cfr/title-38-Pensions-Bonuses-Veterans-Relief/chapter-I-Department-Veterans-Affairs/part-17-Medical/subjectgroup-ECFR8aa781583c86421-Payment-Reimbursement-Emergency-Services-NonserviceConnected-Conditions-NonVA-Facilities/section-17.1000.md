##### ยง 17.1000 Payment or reimbursement for emergency services for nonservice-connected conditions in non-VA facilities. #####

Sections 17.1000 through 17.1008 constitute the requirements under 38 U.S.C. 1725 that govern VA payment or reimbursement for non-VA emergency services furnished to a veteran for nonservice-connected conditions.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1725) Note to ยง 17.1000:

In cases where a patient is admitted for inpatient care, health care providers furnishing emergency treatment who believe they may have a basis for filing a claim with VA for payment under 38 U.S.C. 1725 should contact VA within 48-hours after admission for emergency treatment. Such contact is not a condition of VA payment. However, the contact will assist the provider in understanding the conditions for payment. The contact may also assist the provider in planning for transfer of the veteran after stabilization.
