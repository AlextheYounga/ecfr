##### ยง 155.1318 Modification from the normal public notice requirements during the public health emergency. #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 53504, Sept. 27, 2021.

(a) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury may modify, in part, the State public notice requirements under ยง 155.1312 and the Federal public notice procedures under ยง 155.1316 to expedite a decision on a proposed waiver request during the public health emergency, as defined in 42 CFR 400.200, when a delay would undermine or compromise the purpose of the proposed waiver request and be contrary to the interests of consumers. These flexibilities are limited to event-triggered, emergent situations, and the flexibilities outlined in this section will not be available for States seeking to address a threat to consumers' access to health coverage or care that existed prior to the public health emergency for COVID-19.

(b) A State must meet all of the following criteria to request a modification under paragraph (a) of this section:

(1) The State must request a modification under paragraph (a) of this section, in the form and manner specified by the Secretaries.

(2) The State must have acted in good faith, and in a diligent, timely, and prudent manner in the preparation of the request for a modification under paragraph (a) of this section, and the waiver application request, as applicable.

(3) The State must, as applicable, detail in its request for a modification from State-level notice procedures under paragraph (a) of this section the justification for the request as it relates to the public health emergency and the alternative public notice procedures it proposes to implement at the State level, including public hearings, that are designed to provide the greatest opportunity and level of meaningful public input from impacted stakeholders that is practicable given the emergency circumstances underlying the State's request for a modification.

(4) The State must, as applicable, detail in its request for a modification from Federal-level notice procedures under paragraph (a) of this section the justification for the request and the alternative public notice procedures it requests to be implemented at the Federal level.

(c) The Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury will evaluate a State's request for a modification under paragraph (a) of this section and issue their modification determination within approximately 15 calendar days after the request is received.

(d) The Secretary will publish on the CMS website any modification determinations within 15 calendar days of the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury making such a determination, as well as the approved revised timeline for public comment under the approved alternative State or Federal public notice procedures, as applicable.

(e) The State must publish on its website any modification requests and determinations within 15 calendar days of receipt of the determination, as well as the approved revised timeline for public comment under the alternative State or Federal public notice procedures, as applicable.

(f) The State must, as applicable, implement the alternative public notice procedures at the State level if the State's modification request is approved and, if required, amend the waiver application request.
