(2) Replacing one or more categories of EHBs established at § 156.110(a) in the State's EHB-benchmark plan used for the 2017 plan year with the same category or categories of EHB from the EHB-benchmark plan that another State used for the 2017 plan year under §§ 156.100 and 156.110; or

(3) Otherwise selecting a set of benefits that would become the State's EHB-benchmark plan.

(b) A State's EHB-benchmark plan must:

(2) *Scope of benefits.* (i) Provide a scope of benefits equal to, or greater than, to the extent any supplementation is required to provide coverage within each EHB category at § 156.110(a), the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer plan, defined as either:
