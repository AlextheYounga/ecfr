##### § 156.919 Forms of hearing. #####

(a) All hearings before an ALJ are on the record. The ALJ may receive argument or testimony in writing, in person, or by telephone. The ALJ may receive testimony by telephone only if the ALJ determines that doing so is in the interest of justice and economy and that no party will be unduly prejudiced. The ALJ may require submission of a witness' direct testimony in writing only if the witness is available for cross-examination.

(b) The ALJ may decide a case based solely on the written record where there is no disputed issue of material fact the resolution of which requires the receipt of oral testimony.
