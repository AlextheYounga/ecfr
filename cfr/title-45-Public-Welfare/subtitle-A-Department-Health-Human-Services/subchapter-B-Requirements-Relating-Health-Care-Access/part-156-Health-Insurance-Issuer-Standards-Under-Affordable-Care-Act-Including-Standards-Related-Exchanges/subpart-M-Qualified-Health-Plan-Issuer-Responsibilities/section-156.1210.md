Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 29262, May 14, 2020.

(a) *Responses to reports.* Within 15 calendar days of the date of a payment and collections report from HHS, the issuer must, in a format specified by HHS, either:

(1) Confirm to HHS that the amounts identified in the payment and collections report for the timeframe specified in the report accurately reflect applicable payments owed by the issuer to the Federal government and the payments owed to the issuer by the Federal government; or

(2) Describe to HHS any inaccuracy it identifies in the payment and collections report.

(b) *Late discovery of a discrepancy.* If an issuer reports a discrepancy in a payment and collections report later than 15 calendar days after the date of the report, HHS will work with the issuer to resolve the discrepancy as long as the late reporting was not due to misconduct on the part of the issuer.

(c) *Discrepancies to be addressed in future reports.* Discrepancies in payment and collections reports identified to HHS under this section will be addressed in subsequent payment and collections reports, and will not be used to change debts determined pursuant to invoices generated under previous payment and collections reports.
