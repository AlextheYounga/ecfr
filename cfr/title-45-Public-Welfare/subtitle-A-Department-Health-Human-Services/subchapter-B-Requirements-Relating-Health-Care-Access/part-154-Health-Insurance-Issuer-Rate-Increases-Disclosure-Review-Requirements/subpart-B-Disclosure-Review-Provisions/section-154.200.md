Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 17060, Apr. 17, 2018.

(a) A rate increase filed in a State, or effective in a State that does not require a rate increase to be filed, is subject to review if:

(1) The rate increase is 10 percent or more applicable to a 12-month period that begins on January 1, as calculated under paragraph (c) of this section; or

(2) The rate increase meets or exceeds a State-specific threshold applicable to a 12-month period that begins on January 1, as calculated under paragraph (c) of this section, determined by the Secretary. A State-specific threshold shall be based on factors impacting rate increases in a State to the extent that the data relating to such State-specific factors is available by August 1. States interested in proposing a State-specific threshold for approval are required to submit a proposal to the Secretary by August 1.

(b) The Secretary will publish a notice no later than September 1 of each year, to be effective on January 1 of the following year, concerning whether a threshold under paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section applies to the state; except that, with respect to the 12-month period that begins on September 1, 2011, the threshold under paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies.

(c) A rate increase meets or exceeds the applicable threshold set forth in paragraph (a) of this section if -

(1) For rates filed for coverage beginning before January 1, 2017, the average increase for all enrollees weighted by premium volume meets or exceeds the applicable threshold.

(2) For rates filed for single risk pool coverage beginning on or after January 1, 2017, the average increase, including premium rating factors described in ยง 147.102 of this subchapter, for all enrollees weighted by premium volume for any plan within the product meets or exceeds the applicable threshold.

(d) If a rate increase that does not otherwise meet or exceed the threshold under paragraph (c) of this section meets or exceeds the threshold when combined with a previous increase or increases during the 12-month period preceding the date on which the rate increase would become effective, then the rate increase must be considered to meet or exceed the threshold and is subject to review under ยง 154.210, and such review shall include a review of the aggregate rate increases during the applicable 12-month period.
