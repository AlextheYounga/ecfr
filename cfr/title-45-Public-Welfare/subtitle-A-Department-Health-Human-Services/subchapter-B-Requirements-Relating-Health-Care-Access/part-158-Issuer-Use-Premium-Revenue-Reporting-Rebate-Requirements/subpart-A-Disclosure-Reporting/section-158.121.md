Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 94183, Dec. 22, 2016.

If, for any aggregation as defined in ยง 158.120, 50 percent or more of the total earned premium for an MLR reporting year is attributable to policies newly issued and with less than 12 months of experience in that MLR reporting year, then the experience of these policies may be excluded from the report required under ยง 158.110 of this subpart for that same MLR reporting year. If an issuer chooses to defer reporting of newer business as provided in this section, then the excluded experience must be added to the experience reported in the following MLR reporting year.
