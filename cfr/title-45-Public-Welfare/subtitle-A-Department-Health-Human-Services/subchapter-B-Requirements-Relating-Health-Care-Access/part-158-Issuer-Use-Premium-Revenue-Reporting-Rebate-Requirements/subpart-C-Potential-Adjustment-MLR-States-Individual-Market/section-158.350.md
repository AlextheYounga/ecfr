Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 17071, Apr. 17, 2018.

A State that has made a previous request for an adjustment to the MLR standard must, in addition to the other information required by this subpart, submit information as to what steps the State has taken since its initial and other prior requests, if any, to increase the likelihood that enrollees who have health coverage through issuers that are considered likely to exit the State's individual market will receive coverage at a comparable price and with comparable benefits if the issuer does exit the market.
