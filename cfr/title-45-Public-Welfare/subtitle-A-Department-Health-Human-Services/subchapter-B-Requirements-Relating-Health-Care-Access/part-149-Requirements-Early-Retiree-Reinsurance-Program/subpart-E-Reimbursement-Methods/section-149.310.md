##### ยง 149.310 Timing. #####

(a) An employment-based plan and a sponsor must be certified by the Secretary before claims can be submitted and a reimbursement request may be made. Reimbursement will be made with respect to submitted claims for health benefits at a time and in a manner to be specified by the Secretary, after the sponsor or its designee submits the claims to the Secretary. Claims must satisfy the requirements of this subpart in order to be eligible for reimbursement.

(b) Claims for health benefits may be submitted for a given plan year only upon the approval of an application that references that plan year cycle. Claims for an early retiree for a plan year cannot be submitted until the total paid costs for health benefits for that early retiree incurred for that plan year exceed the applicable cost threshold.

(c) For employment-based plans for which a provider in the normal course of business does not produce a claim, such as a staff-model health maintenance organization, the information required in a claim must be produced and provided to the Secretary, as set out in this regulation and applicable guidance.
