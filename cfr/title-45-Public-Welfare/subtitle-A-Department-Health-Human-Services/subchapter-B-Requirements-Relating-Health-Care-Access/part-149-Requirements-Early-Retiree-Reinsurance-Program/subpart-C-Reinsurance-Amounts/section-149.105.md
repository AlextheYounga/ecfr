##### ยง 149.105 Transition provision. #####

For a certified plan that has a plan year that begins before June 1, 2010 and ends on any date thereafter, the reinsurance amount for the plan year must be determined as follows:

(a) With respect to claims incurred before June 1, 2010, the amount of such claims up to $15,000 count toward the cost threshold and the cost limit. The amount of claims incurred before June 1, 2010 that exceed $15,000 are not eligible for reimbursement and do not count toward the cost limit.

(b) The reinsurance amount to be paid is based only on claims incurred on and after June 1, 2010, that fall between the cost threshold and cost limit for the plan year.
