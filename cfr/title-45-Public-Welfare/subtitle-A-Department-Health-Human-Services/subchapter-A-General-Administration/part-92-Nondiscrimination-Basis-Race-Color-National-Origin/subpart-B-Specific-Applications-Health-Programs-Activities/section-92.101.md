(4) *Restricted use of certain persons to interpret or facilitate communication.* If an entity is required by paragraph (a) of this section, in light of the entity's individualized assessment of the four factors set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, to provide interpretation services, such entity shall not:

(i) Require an individual with limited English proficiency to provide his or her own interpreter;
