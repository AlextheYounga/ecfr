##### § 101.31 Priority ratings. #####

(a) *Levels of priority.* (1) There are two levels of priority established by Federal Priorities and Allocations System regulations, identified by the rating symbols “DO” and “DX”.

(2) All DO-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over unrated orders. All DX-rated orders have equal priority with each other and take precedence over DO-rated orders and unrated orders. (For resolution of conflicts among rated orders of equal priority, see § 101.34(c).)

(3) In addition, a Directive regarding priority treatment for a given item issued by the Department of Health and Human Services for that item takes precedence over any DX-rated order, DO-rated order, or unrated order, as stipulated in the Directive. (For a full discussion of Directives, see § 101. 62.

(b) *Program identification symbols.* Program identification symbols, such as “DO-HR”, or “DX-HR”, indicate which approved program is being supported by a rated order. Programs may be approved under the procedures of E.O. 13603 Section 202 at any time. Program identification symbols do not connote any priority.

(c) *Priority ratings.* A priority rating consists of the rating symbol—DO or DX—and the program identification symbol, such as DO-HR or DX-HR.
