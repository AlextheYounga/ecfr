Explanatory Note:

The Department of State entered into an agreement with the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in 1971 whereby the latter was designated the authority to administer the issuance of the Form IAP-66 in all cases involving the admission, certification, transfer or extension of stay for foreign physicians in exchange visitor status who are receiving graduate medical education or training. The Commission was further designated the authority (Federal Register, Volume 44, No. 59, March 26, 1979), to process waiver requests under the “substantial disruption” provision of Pub. L. 94-484, as amended, within criteria to be provided by the United States Information Agency on advice from the Department of Health and Human Services (formerly Department of Health, Education, and Welfare).
