##### ยง 1.6 Proper Department reliance on guidance documents. #####

(a) *Overview.* A civil enforcement action must have an appropriate legal basis. When the Department takes a civil enforcement action or makes a determination based on an alleged violation of law that has legal consequence for a person or state, it must allege or establish the violation of law by applying statutes or regulations.

(b) *Limitations on the use of guidance documents.* (1) The Department may not use guidance documents to impose binding requirements or prohibitions on persons outside the executive branch except as expressly authorized by law or as expressly incorporated into a contract.

(2) The Department may not treat noncompliance with a standard or practice announced solely in a guidance document as itself a violation of applicable statutes or regulations except as expressly authorized by law.

(3) If the Department uses a guidance document to explain the legal applicability of a statute or regulation, that document can do no more, with respect to prohibition of conduct, than articulate the Department's understanding of how a statute or regulation applies to particular circumstances.

(4) The Department may cite to a guidance document in a civil enforcement action only if it has notified the public of such document in advance through publication, in the Department's guidance repository, as described in ยง 1.4.
