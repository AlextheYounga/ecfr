##### ยง 1173.7 Good faith cost estimates. #####

(a) NEH will, to the extent practicable, make a good faith effort to estimate the likely economic cost impact of the guidance document to determine whether the document might be significant.

(b) When assessing or explaining whether it believes a guidance document is significant, NEH will, at a minimum, provide the same level of analysis that would be required for a major determination under the Congressional Review Act.2

2 See OMB Memorandum M-19-14, Guidance on Compliance with the Congressional Review Act (April 11, 2019).

(c) When OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) determines that a guidance document will be economically significant, NEH will conduct and publish an assessment of the potential costs and benefits of the regulatory action (which may entail a regulatory impact analysis) of the sort that would accompany an economically significant rulemaking, to the extent reasonably possible.
