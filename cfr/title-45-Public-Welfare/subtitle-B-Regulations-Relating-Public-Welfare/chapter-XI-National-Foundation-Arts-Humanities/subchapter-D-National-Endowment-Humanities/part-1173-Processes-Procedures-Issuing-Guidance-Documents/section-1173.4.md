The NEH OGC's review and clearance of guidance documents shall ensure that each guidance document the agency proposes to issue satisfies the following requirements:

(a) The guidance document complies with all relevant statutes and regulations (including any statutory deadlines for agency action);

(b) The guidance document identifies or includes:

(1) The term “guidance” or its functional equivalent;

(2) A concise name for the guidance document;

(3) The NEH office or division issuing the guidance document;

(4) A unique identifier, including, at a minimum, the date of issuance, title of the document, and a number assigned by NEH's OGC (or, in the case of a significant guidance document, the Z-RIN (regulatory identification number));

(5) The general topic that the guidance document addresses;

(6) Citations to applicable statutes and regulations;

(7) A statement noting whether the guidance is intended to revise or replace any previously issued guidance and, if so, sufficient information to identify the previously issued guidance; and

(8) A concise summary of the guidance document's content.

(c) The guidance document avoids using mandatory language, such as “shall,” “must,” “required,” or “requirement,” unless the language is describing an established statutory or regulatory requirement or is addressed to NEH staff and will not foreclose NEH's consideration of positions advanced by affected private parties;

(d) The guidance document is written in plain and understandable English; and

(e) All guidance documents include a clear and prominent statement declaring that the contents of the document do not have the force and effect of law, are not meant to bind the public in any way, and the document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or NEH's policies.
