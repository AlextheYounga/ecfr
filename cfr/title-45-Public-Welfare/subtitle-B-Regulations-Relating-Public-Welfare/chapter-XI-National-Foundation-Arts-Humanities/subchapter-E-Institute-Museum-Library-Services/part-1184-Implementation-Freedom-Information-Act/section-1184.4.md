(a) *Responses within 20 working days.* IMLS will ordinarily grant, partially grant, or deny your request for records within 20 working days after receiving a perfected request.

(b) *Extensions of response time in “unusual circumstances”.* (1) Where the time limits for processing a request cannot be met because of “unusual circumstances,” as defined in the FOIA, the FOIA Officer will notify you as soon as practicable in writing of the unusual circumstances and may extend the response period for up to ten (10) working days.

(2) Where the extension is for more than ten (10) working days, the FOIA Officer will provide you with an opportunity either to modify the request so that it may be processed within the time limits or to arrange an agreed upon alternative time period for processing the request or a modified request.
