##### § 1157.6 Notice-and-comment procedures. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all proposed Arts Endowment guidance documents determined to be a “significant guidance document” within the meaning of § 1157.5 are subject to notice-and-comment procedures. The Arts Endowment shall publish an advance notice in the Federal Register of the proposed guidance document and invite public comments for a minimum of 30 days, then publish a response to major concerns raised in the comments when the final guidance document is published.

(b) All significant guidance documents must have approval and signature on a non-delegable basis by the Chairman or Senior Deputy Chairman, before issuance.

(c) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section will not apply to any significant guidance document unless the Arts Endowment finds, in consultation with OIRA, good cause that notice-and-comment procedures thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (and incorporates the finding of good cause and a brief statement of reasons in the guidance issued). The Arts Endowment and OIRA may establish an agreement on presumptively exempted categories of guidance; such documents will be presumptively exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) Where appropriate, the Arts Endowment may determine a particular guidance document that is otherwise of importance to the Arts Endowment's interests shall also be subject to the notice-and-comment procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section.
