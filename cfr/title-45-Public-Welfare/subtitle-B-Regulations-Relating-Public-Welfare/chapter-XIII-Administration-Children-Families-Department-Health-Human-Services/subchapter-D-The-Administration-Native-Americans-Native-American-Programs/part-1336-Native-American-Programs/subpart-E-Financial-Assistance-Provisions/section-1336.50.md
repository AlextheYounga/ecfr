(2) *Application.* If an applicant wishes to request a waiver of the requirement for a 20 percent non-Federal matching share, it must include with is application for funding a written justification that clearly explains why the applicant cannot provide the matching share and how it meets the criteria.

(3) *Criteria.* Both of the following criterial must be met for an applicant to be eligible for a waiver of the non-Federal matching requirement:

(ii) Applicant can document that reasonable efforts to obtain cash or inkind contributions for the purposes of the project from third parties have been unsuccessful. Evidence of such efforts can include letters from possible sources of funding indicating that the requested resources are not available for that project. The requests must be appropriate to the source in terms of project purpose, applicant eligibility, and reasonableness of the request.

(4) *Approval.* For a waiver to be approved, ANA must determine that it will not prevent the award of other grants at levels it believes are desirable for the purposes of the program.

(i) As a result of funding limitations; and

(ii) Not as a result of an adverse evaluation of the project's purpose or the manner in which it was conducted; and
