(1) The provisions of 45 CFR part 74 pertaining to the Administration of Grants;

(2) The provisions of 45 CFR part 16, Departmental Grants Appeal Process, and the provisions of Informal Grant Appeal Procedures (Indirect Costs) in volume 45 CFR part 75;

(5) The provisions of 45 CFR part 46 pertaining to protection of human subjects.

(b) Several program policies regarding confidentiality of information, treatment, conflict of interest and State protection apply to recipients of Runaway and Homeless Youth Program grants. These include:

(1) *Confidential information.* All information including lists of names, addresses, photographs, and records of evaluation of individuals served by a runaway and homeless youth project shall be confidential and shall not be disclosed or transferred to any individual or to any public or private agency without written consent of the youth and family. Youth served by a runaway and homeless youth project shall have the right to review their records; to correct a record or file a statement of disagreement; and to be apprised of the individuals who have reviewed their records. Procedures shall be established for the training of project staff in the protection of these rights and for the secure storage of records.

(2) *Medical, psychiatric or psychological treatment.* No youth shall be subject to medical, psychiatric or psychological treatment without the consent of the youth and family unless otherwise permitted by State law.

(3) *Conflict of interest.* Employees or individuals participating in a program or project under the Act shall not use their positions for a purpose that is, or gives the appearance of being, motivated by a desire for private gain for themselves or others, particularly those with whom they have family, business or other ties.

(4) *State law protection.* HHS policies regarding confidential information and experimentation and treatment shall not apply if HHS finds that State law is more protective of the rights of runaway or otherwise homeless youth.

(c) Nothing in the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act or these regulations gives the Federal Government control over the staffing and personnel decisions regarding individuals hired by a runaway and homeless youth project receiving Federal funds.
