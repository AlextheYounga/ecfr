##### ยง 1627.6 Transfers to other recipients. #####

(a) The requirements of ยง 1627.3 shall apply to all subgrants by one recipient to another recipient.

(b) The subrecipient shall audit any funds subgranted to it in its annual audit and supply a copy of this audit to the recipient. The recipient shall either submit the relevant part of this audit with its next annual audit or, if an audit has been recently submitted, submit it as an addendum to that recently submitted audit.

(c) In addition to the provisions of ยง 1627.3(d), the Corporation may hold the subrecipient directly responsible for any disallowed expenditures of subgrant funds. Thus, the Corporation may recover all of the disallowed costs from either recipient or subrecipient or may divide the recovery between the two; the Corporation's total recovery may not exceed the amount of expenditures disallowed.

(d) Funds received by a recipient from other recipients in the form of fees and dues shall be accounted for and included in the annual audit of the recipient receiving these funds as Corporation funds.
