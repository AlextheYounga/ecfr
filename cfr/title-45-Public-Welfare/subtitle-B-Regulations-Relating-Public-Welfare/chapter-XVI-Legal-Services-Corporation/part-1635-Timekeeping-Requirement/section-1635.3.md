##### ยง 1635.3 Timekeeping requirement. #####

(a) All expenditures of funds for recipient actions are, by definition, for cases, matters, or supporting activities. The allocation of all expenditures must be carried out in accordance with 45 CFR part 1630.

(b) Time spent by attorneys and paralegals must be documented by time records which record the amount of time spent on each case, matter, or supporting activity.

(1) Time records must be created contemporaneously and account for time by date and in increments not greater than one-quarter of an hour which comprise all of the efforts of the attorneys and paralegals for which compensation is paid by the recipient.

(2) Each record of time spent must contain: for a case, a unique client name or case number; for matters or supporting activities, an identification of the category of action on which the time was spent.

(c) The timekeeping system must be able to aggregate time record information on both closed and pending cases by legal problem type.

(d) Recipients shall require any attorney or paralegal who works part-time for the recipient and part-time for an organization that engages in restricted activities to certify in writing that the attorney or paralegal has not engaged in restricted activity during any time for which the attorney or paralegal was compensated by the recipient or has not used recipient resources for restricted activities. The certification requirement does not apply to a *de minimis* action related to a restricted activity. Actions consistent with the *de minimis* standard are those that meet all or most of the following criteria: actions that are of little substance; require little time; are not initiated by the part-time employee; and, for the most part, are unavoidable. Certifications shall be made on a quarterly basis and shall be made on a form determined by LSC.
