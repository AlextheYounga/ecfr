##### ยง 1203.2 Application of this part. #####

(a) This part applies to each program for which Federal financial assistance is authorized under a law administered by ACTION, including the types of Federal financial assistance listed in appendix A to this part. It also applies to money paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended after the effective date of this part pursuant to an application approved before that effective date. This part does not apply to:

(1) Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty contracts;

(2) Money paid, property transferred, or other assistance extended before the effective date of this part, except when the assistance was subject to the title VI regulations of an agency whose responsibilities are now exercised by ACTION;

(3) Assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary; or

(4) Employment practices, under a program, of an employer, employment agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in ยง 1203.4(c).

The fact that a type of Federal financial assistance is not listed in Appendix A to this part does not mean, if title VI is otherwise applicable, that a program is not covered. Other types of Federal financial assistance under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to Appendix A to this part.

(b) In a program receiving Federal financial assistance in the form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under that property are included, the nondiscrimination requirement of this part extends to a facility located wholly or in part in that space.
