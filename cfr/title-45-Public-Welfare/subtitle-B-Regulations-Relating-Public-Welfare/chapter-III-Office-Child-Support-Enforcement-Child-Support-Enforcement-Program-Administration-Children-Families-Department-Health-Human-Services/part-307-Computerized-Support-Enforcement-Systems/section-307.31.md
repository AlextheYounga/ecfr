(1) The Office has approved an APD in accordance with § 307.15;

(2) The Office determines that the system meets the requirements specified in § 307.10, or 42 U.S.C. 654(16) [454(16) of the Act];

(3) The Office determines that the expenditures incurred are consistent with the approved APD;

(5) The State IV-D agency agrees in writing to use the system for a period of time which is consistent with the APD approved by the Office; and

(6) The State or local government has ownership rights in software, software modifications and associated documentation that is designed, developed, installed or enhanced under this section subject to the Department of Health and Human Services license specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) *Federal financial participation in the costs of hardware and proprietary software.* (1) Until September 30, 2001, FFP at the 80 percent rate is available for expenditures for the rental or purchase of hardware for the planning, design, development, installation, or enhancement of a computerized support enforcement system as described in § 307.10 or 42 U.S.C. 654(16) [454(16) of the Act].

(2) Until September 30, 2001, FFP at the 80 percent rate is available for the rental or purchase of proprietary operating/vendor software necessary for the operation of hardware during the planning, design, development, installation, enhancement or operation of a computerized support enforcement system in accordance with the OCSE guideline entitled “Automated Systems for Child Support Enforcement: A Guide for States.” FFP at the 80 percent rate is not available for proprietary application software developed specifically for a computerized support enforcement system. (See § 307.35 regarding reimbursement at the applicable matching rate.)

(c) *HHS rights to software.* The Department of Health and Human Services reserves a royalty-free, non-exclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use for Federal government purposes, software, software modifications, and documentation developed under § 307.10 or 42 U.S.C. 654(16) [454(16) of the Act]. This license would permit the Department to authorize the use of software, software modifications and documentation developed under § 307.10 or 42 U.S.C. 654(16) [454(16) of the Act] in another project or activity funded by the Federal government.

(1) The Office shall disallow FFP as of the date the State failed to comply substantially with the approved APD; and

(2) FFP at the 80 percent and applicable matching rates is not available in any expenditure incurred under the APD after the date of the suspension until the date the Office determines that the State has taken the actions specified in the notice of suspension described in § 307.40(a). The Office will notify the State in writing upon making such a determination.

(f) *Allocation formula.* Payments at the 80 percent rate to individual States, Territories and systems defined in 42 U.S.C. 655(a)(3)(B)(iii) [455(a)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act] (hereafter referred to as “States”) will be equal to the sum of:

(1) A base amount of $2,000,000; and

(2) An additional amount defined as the Allocation Factor computed as follows:

(ii) Caseload Factor - a ratio of the six-year average IV-D caseload as reported by a State for fiscal years 1990 through 1995 to the total six-year average IV-D caseload in all States for the same period;

(iii) Census Factor - a ratio of the number of children in a State with one parent living elsewhere as reported in the 1992 Current Population Survey - Child Support Supplement to the total number of such children in all States.
