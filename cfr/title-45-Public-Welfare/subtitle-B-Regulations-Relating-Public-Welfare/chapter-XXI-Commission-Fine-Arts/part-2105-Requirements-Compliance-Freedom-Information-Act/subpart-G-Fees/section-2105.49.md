##### ยง 2105.49 What if the Agency needs clarification about fee issues? #####

(a) If your FOIA request does not contain sufficient information for the Agency to determine your proper fee category or leaves another fee issue unclear, the Agency may ask you to provide additional clarification. If it does so, the Agency will notify you that it will not be able to comply with your FOIA request unless you provide the clarification requested.

(b) If the Agency asks you to provide clarification, the 20-workday statutory time limit for the Agency to respond to the request is temporarily suspended.

(1) If the Agency receives a written response within 20 workdays after the Agency has requested the additional clarification, the 20-workday statutory time limit for processing the request will resume (see ยง 2105.15).

(2) If you still have not provided sufficient information to resolve the fee issue, the Agency may ask you again to provide additional clarification and notify you that it will not be able to comply with your FOIA request unless you provide the additional information requested within 20 workdays after the Agency has requested the additional clarification.

(3) If the Agency asks you again for additional clarification, the statutory time limit for response will be temporarily suspended again and will resume again if the Agency receives a written response from you within 20 workdays after the Agency has requested the additional clarification.

(c) If the Agency asks for clarification about a fee issue and does not receive a written response from you within 20 workdays after the Agency has requested the additional clarification, it will presume that you are no longer interested and will close the file on the request.
