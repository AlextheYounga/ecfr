##### ยง 2105.36 What are the requester fee categories? #####

(a) There are four categories of requesters for the purposes of determining fees - commercial-use, educational and noncommercial scientific institutions, representatives of news media, and all others.

(b) The Agency's decision to place you in a particular fee category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on your intended use of the information and, in most cases, your identity. If you do not submit sufficient information in your FOIA request for the Agency to determine your proper fee category, the Agency may ask you to provide additional information (see ยง 2105.49). If you request placement in a particular fee category but the Agency places you in a different fee category, the Agency will provide you with an explanation of why you were not placed in the fee category you requested (for example, if you were placed in the commercial use requester category rather than the category you requested, the Agency will describe how the records would further your commercial, trade, or profit interests).

(c) See ยง 2105.68 for the definitions of each of these fee categories.
