##### ยง 2553.61 When may a sponsor serve as a volunteer station? #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 64656, Dec. 17, 2018.

The sponsor may function as a volunteer station, provided that no more than 5% of the total number of volunteers budgeted for the project are assigned to it in administrative or support positions. This limitation does not apply to the assignment of volunteers to other programs administered by the sponsor or special volunteer activities of the project. The RSVP project itself may function as a volunteer station or may initiate special volunteer activities provided the Corporation agrees that these activities are in accord with program objectives and will not hinder overall project operations.
