It is within the Corporation's discretion to determine if Counsel is employed and counsel fees, court costs, bail and other expenses incidental to the defense of a RSVP volunteer are paid in a criminal, civil or administrative proceeding, when such a proceeding arises directly out of performance of the volunteer's activities. The circumstances under which the Corporation may pay such expenses are specified in 45 CFR part 1220.
