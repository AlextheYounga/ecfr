(2) A sponsor is responsible for identifying non-Corporation funds which may include in-kind contributions.

(b) *Under what circumstances does the Corporation allow less than the percentage identified in paragraph (a) of this section?* The Corporation may allow exceptions to the local support requirement identified in paragraph (a) of this section in cases of demonstrated need such as:

(1) Initial difficulties in the development of local funding sources during the first three years of operations; or

(2) An economic downturn, the occurrence of a natural disaster, or similar events in the service area that severely restrict or reduce sources of local funding support; or

(3) The unexpected discontinuation of local support from one or more sources that a project has relied on for a period of years.

(c) *May the Corporation restrict how a sponsor uses locally generated contributions in excess of the non-Corporation support required?* Whenever locally generated contributions to RSVP projects are in excess of the non-Corporation funds required (10 percent of the total cost in the first year, 20 percent in the second year and 30 percent in the third and succeeding years), the Corporation may not restrict the manner in which such contributions are expended provided such expenditures are consistent with the provisions of the Act.

(d) *Are program expenditures subject to audit?* All expenditures by the grantee of Federal and Non-Federal funds, including expenditures from excess locally generated contributions, are subject to audit by the Corporation, its Inspector General, or their authorized agents.
