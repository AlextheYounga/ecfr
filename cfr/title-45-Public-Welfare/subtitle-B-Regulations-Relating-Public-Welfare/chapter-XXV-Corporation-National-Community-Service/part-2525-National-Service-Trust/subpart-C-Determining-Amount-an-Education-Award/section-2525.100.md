(c) *Calculating a pro-rated award following release for compelling personal circumstances.* The education award for an Eligible Individual who is released from completing an approved term of service for compelling personal circumstances is equal to the product of:

(1) The number of hours completed divided by the number of hours in the approved term of service; and

(2) The amount of the education award for the approved term of service.

(d) *Calculating a discounted education award amount.* To ensure that an Eligible Individual receives no more than the aggregate value of two awards, pursuant to ยง 2525.50, if the sum of the education award value offered for a term of service and the aggregate value of previously-received education awards exceeds the value of two awards, then the individual may receive only a portion of that offered education award, such that the aggregate value of the education awards is not greater than the value of two awards.
