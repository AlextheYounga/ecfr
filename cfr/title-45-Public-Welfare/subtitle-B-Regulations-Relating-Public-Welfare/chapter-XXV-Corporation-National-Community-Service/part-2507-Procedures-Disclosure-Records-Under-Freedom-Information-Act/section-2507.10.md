##### ยง 2507.10 What records are specifically exempt from disclosure? #####

Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of portions which are exempt under this section. The following categories are examples of records maintained by the Corporation which, under the provision of 5 U.S.C. 552(b), are exempted from disclosure:

(a) *Records required to be withheld under criteria established by an Executive Order in the interest of national defense and policy and which are in fact properly classified pursuant to any such Executive Order.* Included in this category are records required by Executive Order No. 12958 (3 CFR, 1995 Comp., p. 333), as amended, to be classified in the interest of national defense or foreign policy.

(b) *Records related solely to internal personnel rules and practices.* Included in this category are internal rules and regulations relating to personnel management operations which cannot be disclosed to the public without substantial prejudice to the effective performance of significant functions of the Corporation.

(c) Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute.

(d) *Information of a commercial or financial nature including trade secrets given in confidence.* Included in this category are records containing commercial or financial information obtained from any person and customarily regarded as privileged and confidential by the person from whom they were obtained.

(e) *Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than a party in litigation with the Corporation.* Included in this category are memoranda, letters, inter-agency and intra-agency communications and internal drafts, opinions and interpretations prepared by staff or consultants and records meant to be used as part of deliberations by staff, or ordinarily used in arriving at policy determinations and decisions.

(f) *Personnel, medical and similar files.* Included in this category are personnel and medical information files of staff, individual national service applicants and participants, lists of names and home addresses, and other files or material containing private or personal information, the public disclosure of which would amount to a clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of any person to whom the information pertains.

(g) *Investigatory files.* Included in this category are files compiled for the enforcement of all laws, or prepared in connection with government litigation and adjudicative proceedings, provided however, that such records shall be made available to the extent that their production will not:

(1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;

(2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

(3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source, and in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished by confidential source;

(5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or

(6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel.
