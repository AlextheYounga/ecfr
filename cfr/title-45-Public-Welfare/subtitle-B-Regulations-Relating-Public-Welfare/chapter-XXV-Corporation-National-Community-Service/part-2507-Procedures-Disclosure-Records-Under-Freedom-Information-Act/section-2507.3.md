##### ยง 2507.3 What types of records are available for disclosure to the public? #####

(a)(1) The Corporation will make available to any member of the public who requests them, the following Corporation records:

(i) All publications and other documents provided by the Corporation to the public in the normal course of agency business will continue to be made available upon request to the Corporation;

(ii) Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of administrative cases;

(iii) Statements of policy and interpretation adopted by the agency and not published in the Federal Register;

(iv) Administrative staff manuals and instructions to the staff that affect a member of the public; and

(v) Copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which, because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records.

(2) Copies of a current index of the materials in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (v) of this section that are maintained by the Corporation, or any portion thereof, will be furnished or made available for inspection upon request.

(b) To the extent necessary to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the Corporation may delete identifying details from materials furnished under this part.

(c) Brochures, leaflets, and other similar published materials shall be furnished to the public on request to the extent they are available. Copies of any such materials which are out of print shall be furnished to the public at the cost of duplication, provided, however, that, in the event no copy exists, the Corporation shall not be responsible for reprinting the document.

(d) All records of the Corporation which are requested by a member of the public in accordance with the procedures established in this part shall be duplicated for the requester, except to the extent that the Corporation determines that such records are exempt from disclosure under the Act.

(e) The Corporation will not be required to create new records, compile lists of selected items from its files, or provide a requester with statistical or other data (unless such data has been compiled previously and is available in the form of a record.)

(f) These records will be made available for public inspection and copying in the Corporation's reading room located at the Corporation for National and Community Service, 250 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20525, during the hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, except on official holidays.

(g) Corporation records will be made available to the public unless it is determined that such records should be withheld from disclosure under subsection 552(b) of the Act and or in accordance with this part.
