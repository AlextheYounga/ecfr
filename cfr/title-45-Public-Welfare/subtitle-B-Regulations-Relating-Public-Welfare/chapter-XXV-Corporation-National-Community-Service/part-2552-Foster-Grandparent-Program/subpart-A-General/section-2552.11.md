The Foster Companion Program provides grants to qualified agencies and organizations for the dual purpose of engaging persons 55 and older, particularly those with limited incomes, in volunteer service to meet critical community needs; and to provide a high quality experience that will enrich the lives of the volunteers. Program funds are to be used to support Foster Grandparents in providing supportive, person to person service to children with exceptional needs, or in circumstances that limit their academic, social, or emotional development.
