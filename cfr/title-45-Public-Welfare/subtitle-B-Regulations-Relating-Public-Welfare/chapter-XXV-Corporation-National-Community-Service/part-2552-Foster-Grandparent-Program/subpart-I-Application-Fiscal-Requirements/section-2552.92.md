(a) *Is non-CNCS support required?* A CNCS grant may be awarded to fund up to 90 percent of the cost of development and operation of a Foster Grandparent project. The sponsor is required to contribute at least 10 percent of the total project cost from non-Federal sources or authorized Federal sources.

(b) *Under what circumstances does CNCS allow less than the 10 percent non-CNCS support?* CNCS may allow exceptions to the 10 percent local support requirement in cases of demonstrated need such as:

(1) Initial difficulties in the development of local funding sources during the first three years of operations; or

(2) An economic downturn, the occurrence of a natural disaster, or similar events in the service area that severely restrict or reduce sources of local funding support; or

(3) The unexpected discontinuation of local support from one or more sources that a project has relied on for a period of years.

(c) *May CNCS restrict how a sponsor uses locally generated contributions in excess of the 10 percent non-CNCS support required?* Whenever locally generated contributions to Foster Grandparent projects are in excess of the minimum 10 percent non-CNCS support required, CNCS may not restrict the manner in which such contributions are expended provided such expenditures are consistent with the provisions of the Act.

(d) *Are program expenditures subject to audit*? All expenditures by the grantee of Federal and non-Federal funds, including expenditures from excess locally generated contributions in support of the grant are subject to audit by CNCS, its Inspector General, or their authorized agents.

(e) *May a sponsor pay stipends at rates different than those established by CNCS?* No, a sponsor shall pay stipends at rates established by CNCS.
