##### § 2530.85 What steps are necessary to revoke a transfer? #####

(a) *Request for revocation.* Before revoking a transfer, the transferring individual must submit a request to the Corporation that includes —

(1) The individual's written authorization to revoke the award;

(2) The year in which the award was earned;

(3) The specific amount to be revoked; and

(4) The identity of the designated individual.

(b) *Credit to transferring individual.* Upon receipt of a request including all required information listed in paragraph (a) of this section, the Corporation will deduct the amount specified in the transferring individual's request from the designated individual's account and credit the amount to the account of the transferring individual, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The Corporation will notify the transferring individual of the amount revoked.

(c) *Used awards.* A revocation may only apply to that portion of the transferred award that has not been used by the designated individual. If the designated individual has used the entire transferred amount prior to the date the Corporation receives the revocation request, no amount will be returned to the transferring individual. An amount is considered to be used when it is disbursed from the National Service Trust, not when a request is received to use an award.

(d) *Notification to designated individual.* The Corporation will notify the designated individual of the amount being revoked as of the date of the Corporation's receipt of the revocation request.

(e) *Timing of revocation.* The Corporation must receive the request to revoke the transfer from the transferring individual prior to the award's expiration ten years from the date the award was originally earned.
