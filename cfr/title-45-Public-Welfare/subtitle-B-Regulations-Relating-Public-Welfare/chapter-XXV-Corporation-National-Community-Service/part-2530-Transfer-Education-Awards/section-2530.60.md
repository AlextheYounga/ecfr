(b) *Impact on Designated Individual.* For the purposes of determining the value of the transferred education award under ยง 2526.50, a designated individual will be considered to have received a value equal to the amount accepted divided by the amount of a full-time award in the year the transferring individual's position was approved.

(c) *Result of revocation on award value.* If the transferring individual revokes, in whole or in part, a transfer, the value of the education award considered to have been received by the designated individual for purposes of ยง 2526.50 will be reduced accordingly.
