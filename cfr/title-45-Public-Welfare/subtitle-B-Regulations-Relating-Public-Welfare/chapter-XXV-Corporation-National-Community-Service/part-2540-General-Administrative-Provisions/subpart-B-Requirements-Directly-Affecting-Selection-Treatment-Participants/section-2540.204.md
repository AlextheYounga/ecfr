##### ยง 2540.204 When must I conduct a National Service Criminal History Check on an individual in a covered position? #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 11147, Feb. 24, 2021.

(a) *Timing of the National Service Criminal History Check Components.* (1) You must conduct and review the results of the nationwide NSOPW check required under ยง 2540.203 before an individual in a covered position begins work or starts service.

(2) You must initiate state registry or FBI criminal history checks required under ยง 2540.203 before an individual in a covered position begins work or starts service. You may permit an individual in a covered position to begin work or start service pending the receipt of results from state registry or FBI criminal history checks as long as the individual is not permitted access to children age 17 years or younger, to individuals age 60 years or older, or to individuals with disabilities, without being in the physical presence of an appropriate individual, as described in ยง 2540.205(g) of this chapter.

(b) *Consecutive terms.* If an individual serves consecutive terms of service in a covered position and does not have a break in service that exceeds 120 days, then no additional National Service Criminal History Check is required, as long as the original check is a compliant check for the covered position in which the individual will be serving or working following the break in service. If your program or project is designed with breaks in service over 120 days, but less than 180 days between consecutive terms, you may request approval for a break in service of up to 180 days before a new National Service Criminal History Check is required. Your request must describe the overall program design, explain why the longer period is reasonable, and demonstrate that you have established adequate risk management controls for the extended break in service.
