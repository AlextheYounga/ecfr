Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 11148, Feb. 24, 2021.

(a) *Alternative search procedure.* (1) If you submit a written request to the Corporation's Office of Grants Management, the Corporation will consider approving an alternative search procedure:

(i) If you demonstrate that you are prohibited or otherwise precluded under state law from complying with a Corporation requirement relating to the National Service Criminal History Check, or

(ii) If you can obtain substantially equivalent or better information through an alternative search procedure.

(2) The Office of Grants Management will review the alternative search procedure to ensure that it:

(i) Verifies the identity of the individual; and

(ii) Includes a search of an alternative criminal database that is sufficient to identify the existence or absence of criminal offenses.

(b) *Exceptions to Criminal History Check requirements for individuals with recurring access to vulnerable populations.* (1) *Exception that does not require prior Corporation approval - Episodic Access.* (i) For the purposes of this section, an individual's access to a vulnerable population is considered to be episodic in nature if the service is not a regular, scheduled, and anticipated component of the individual's position description.

(ii) You are not required to conduct the fingerprint-based FBI criminal history check on individuals in covered positions with recurring access to vulnerable populations, as described in § 2540.203 of this chapter, when the individual's access to a vulnerable population is episodic in nature or for a 1-day period.

(iii) No prior approval is required from the Corporation for you to apply this exception. You must make and document a determination that the individual's access to vulnerable populations is episodic, as defined by paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(2) *Exceptions that require prior approval of the Corporation.* You are not required to conduct the fingerprint-based FBI criminal history check on individuals in covered positions with recurring access to vulnerable populations, as described in § 2540.203 of this chapter, if you demonstrate and the Corporation determines in writing that:

(i) Complying with § 2540.203(b)(2)(iii) of this chapter is cost-prohibitive;

(ii) You are not authorized, or are otherwise unable, under state or federal law, to access the national criminal history background check system of the FBI; or

(iii) That you are exempt from the requirement in § 2540.203(b)(2)(iii) of this chapter for good cause.
