(a) *Full-time term of service.* Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, the education award for a full-time term of service in an approved AmeriCorps position of at least 1,700 hours will be equal to the maximum amount of a Federal Pell Grant under Section 401 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) that a student eligible for such grant may receive in the aggregate for the award year in which the term of service is approved by the Corporation.

(b) *Part-time term of service.* Except as provided in paragraph (g), the education award for a part-time term of service in an approved AmeriCorps position of at least 900 hours is equal to one half of the amount of an education award amount for a full-time term of service described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) *Reduced part-time term of service.* Except as provided in paragraph (g), the education award for a reduced part-time term of service in an approved AmeriCorps position of fewer than 900 hours is:

(2) An amount as determined otherwise by the Corporation.

(d) *Release for compelling personal circumstances.* The education award for an individual who is released from completing an originally-approved term of service for compelling personal circumstances is equal to the product of—
