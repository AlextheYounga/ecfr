Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 4870, Jan. 15, 2021.

(a) *Information or facts that determine the applicability of the general prohibitions.* The following five types of facts determine your obligations under the ten general prohibitions and the EAR generally:

(1) *Classification of the item.* The classification of the item on the Commerce Control List (see part 774 of the EAR);

(2) *Destination.* The country of ultimate destination for an export or reexport (see parts 738 and 774 of the EAR concerning the Country Chart and the Commerce Control List);

(3) *End-user.* The ultimate end user (see General Prohibition Four (paragraph (b)(4) of this section) and supplement no. 1 to part 764 of the EAR for references to persons with whom your transaction may not be permitted; see General Prohibition Five (Paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 for references to end-users for whom you may need an export or reexport license).

(4) *End-use.* The ultimate end-use (see General Prohibition Five (paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and part 744 of the EAR for general end-use restrictions); and

(5) *Conduct.* Conduct such as contracting, financing, and freight forwarding in support of a proliferation project as described in part 744 of the EAR.

(b) *General prohibitions.* The following ten general prohibitions describe certain exports, reexports, and other conduct, subject to the scope of the EAR, in which you may not engage unless you either have a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) or qualify under part 740 of the EAR for a License Exception from each applicable general prohibition in this paragraph. The License Exceptions at part 740 of the EAR apply only to General Prohibitions One (Exports and Reexports in the Form Received), Two (Parts and Components Reexports), and Three (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Reexports); however, selected License Exceptions are specifically referenced and authorized in part 746 of the EAR concerning embargo destinations and in § 744.2(c) of the EAR regarding nuclear end-uses.

(1) *General Prohibition One - Export and reexport of controlled items to listed countries (Exports and Reexports).* You may not, without a license or License Exception, export any item subject to the EAR to another country or reexport any item of U.S.-origin if each of the following is true:

(i) The item is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), and

(ii) Export to the country of destination requires a license for the control reason as indicated on the Country Chart at part 738 of the EAR. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your item and the ultimate destination as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.)1 Note that each License Exception described at part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition One if all terms and conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.

1 See part 738 of the EAR for selected controls that are not specified on the Country Chart.

(2) *General Prohibition Two - Reexport and export from abroad of foreign-made items incorporating more than a de minimis amount of controlled U.S. content (U.S. Content Reexports).* (i) You may not, without a license or license exception, reexport or export from abroad foreign-made commodities that incorporate controlled U.S.-origin commodities, foreign-made commodities that are “bundled” with controlled U.S.-origin software, foreign-made software that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin software, or foreign-made technology that is commingled with controlled U.S.-origin technology if such items require a license according to any of the provisions in the EAR and incorporate or are commingled with more than a *de minimis* amount of controlled U.S. content, as defined in § 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope of the EAR.

(A) It incorporates more than the *de minimis* amount of controlled U.S. content, as defined in § 734.4 of the EAR concerning the scope of the EAR;

(B) It is controlled for a reason indicated in the applicable ECCN; and

(C) Its export to the country of destination requires a license for that control reason as indicated on the Country Chart. (The scope of this prohibition is determined by the correct classification of your foreign-made item and the ultimate destination, as that combination is reflected on the Country Chart.)

(ii) Each License Exception described in part 740 of the EAR supersedes General Prohibition Two if all terms and conditions of a given License Exception are met by the exporter or reexporter.

(3) *General Prohibition Three - Foreign-produced direct product of specified “technology” and “software” (Foreign-Produced Direct Product Rule)* - (i) *Country scope of prohibition.* You may not, without a license or license exception, reexport any item subject to the scope of this General Prohibition Three to a destination in Country Group D:1, E:1, or E:2 (See supplement no.1 to part 740 of the EAR). Additionally, you may not, without a license or license exception, reexport or export from abroad any ECCN 0A919 commodities subject to the scope of this General Prohibition Three to a destination in Country Group D:1, D:3, D:4, D:5, E:1, or E:2.

(4) *General Prohibition Four (Denial Orders) - Engaging in actions prohibited by a denial order.* (i) You may not take any action that is prohibited by a denial order issued under part 766 of the EAR, Administrative Enforcement Proceedings. These orders prohibit many actions in addition to direct exports by the person denied export privileges, including some transfers within a single country, either in the United States or abroad, by other persons. You are responsible for ensuring that any of your transactions in which a person who is denied export privileges is involved do not violate the terms of the order. Orders denying export privileges are published in the Federal Register when they are issued and are the legally controlling documents in accordance with their terms. BIS also maintains compilations of persons denied export privileges on its Web site at *http://www.bis.doc.gov.* BIS may, on an exceptional basis, authorize activity otherwise prohibited by a denial order. See § 764.3(a)(2) of the EAR.

(ii) There are no License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR that authorize conduct prohibited by this General Prohibition Four.

(5) *General Prohibition Five - Export or reexport to prohibited end-uses or end-users (End-Use End-User).* You may not, without a license, knowingly export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to an end-user or end-use that is prohibited by part 744 of the EAR.

Unless a License Exception or other authorization is authorized in part 746 of the EAR, the License Exceptions described in part 740 of the EAR are not available to overcome this general prohibition.

(7) *General Prohibition Seven - Support of proliferation activities (U.S. person proliferation activity)* - (i) *Support of proliferation activities (U.S. person proliferation activity).* (A) If you are a U.S. person as that term is defined in § 744.6(c) of the EAR, you may not engage in any activities prohibited by § 744.6(a) or (b) of the EAR, which prohibits the performance, without a license from BIS, of certain financing, contracting, service, support, transportation, freight forwarding, or employment that you know will assist in certain proliferation activities described further in part 744 of the EAR.

(ii) *Country scope.* This General Prohibition Eight applies to Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Cambodia, Cuba, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Mongolia, North Korea, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Vietnam.

(9) *General Prohibition Nine - Violation of any order, terms, and conditions (Orders, Terms, and Conditions).* You may not violate terms or conditions of a license or of a License Exception issued under or made a part of the EAR, and you may not violate any order issued under or made a part of the EAR.
