To determine the scope and eligibility requirements, you will need to turn to the sections or specific paragraphs of part 740 of the EAR (License Exceptions).

Licenses issued pursuant to the policy set forth in this paragraph generally will have a condition prohibiting both reexports from Cuba to any other destination and uses that enable or facilitate the export of goods or services from Cuba, that primarily generate revenue for the state.

Note 2 to paragraph (b)(3)(i):

The policy of case-by-case review in this paragraph is intended to facilitate exports and reexports to meet the needs of the Cuban people.

Applications for export or reexport of items destined to the Cuban military, police, intelligence or security services also generally will be denied.
