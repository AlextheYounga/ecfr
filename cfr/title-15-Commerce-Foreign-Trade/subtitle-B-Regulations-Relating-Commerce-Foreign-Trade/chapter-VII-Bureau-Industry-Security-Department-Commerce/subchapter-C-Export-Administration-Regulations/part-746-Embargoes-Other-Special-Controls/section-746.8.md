(i) The U.S.-origin content is described in an Anti-Terrorism (AT)-only ECCN and is not otherwise excluded from the applicable Scope column in supplement No. 3 to this part. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(5), AT-only items means any ECCN that only specifies either only AT in the reason for control paragraph of the ECCN or is classified under ECCN 9A991; and
