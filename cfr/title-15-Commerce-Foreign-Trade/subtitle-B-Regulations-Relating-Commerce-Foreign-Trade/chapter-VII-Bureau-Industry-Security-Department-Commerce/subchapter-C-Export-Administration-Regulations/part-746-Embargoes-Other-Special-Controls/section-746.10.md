Note to paragraph (a):

For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, a 'luxury good' means any item that is identified in supplement no. 5 to this part.

(b) *Licensing policy.* Applications for the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) of any item that requires a license for pursuant to the requirements of this section will be reviewed with a policy of denial. The following types of license applications will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the transaction in question would benefit the Russian or Belarusian government or defense sector: applications involving items to meet humanitarian needs; applications for the disposition of items by companies not headquartered in Country Group D:1, D:5, E:1 or E:2 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 that are curtailing or closing all operations in Russia or Belarus; and replacement licenses for exports and reexports to and transfers within Russia and Belarus to add items described in HTS-6 Codes that were added to the EAR after the effective validation date of the BIS license. The case-by-case license application review policy for items to meet humanitarian needs is included to address certain 'luxury goods' items that may be used in medical devices or situations in which a case-by-case analysis is needed to determine whether a license application should be approved to meet humanitarian needs while also taking into account the applicable broader U.S. national security and foreign policy concerns. *See* also § 750.7(c)(1)(xi) for the divesture of items within Russia or Belarus or the transfer of items within Russia or Belarus for the purpose of reexporting from Russia or Belarus. For purposes of § 750.7(c)(1)(xi), divesture means the action or process of selling off subsidiary business interests or investments involving items subject to the EAR.
