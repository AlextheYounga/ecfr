Technology exports and reexports authorized under paragraph (b)(4) of this section may be made as actual shipments, transmissions, or releases. Individuals leaving the United States temporarily (i.e., traveling) must bring back items exported and reexported under this License Exception unless they consume the items abroad or are otherwise authorized to dispose of them under the EAR.

(3) Not intended for sale or other disposal; and

(4) Not exported under a bill of lading as cargo if exported by crew members.

(d) *Special provision: unaccompanied baggage.* Individuals departing the United States may ship unaccompanied baggage, which is baggage sent from the United States on a carrier other than that on which an individual departs. Crew members of exporting carriers may not ship unaccompanied baggage. Unaccompanied shipments under this License Exception shall be clearly marked “BAGGAGE.” Shipments of unaccompanied baggage may be made at the time of, or within a reasonable time before or after departure of the consignee or owner from the United States. Personal baggage controlled for chemical and biological weapons (CB), missile technology (MT), national security (NS), encryption items (EI) or nuclear nonproliferation (NP) must be shipped within 3 months before or after the month in which the consignee or owner departs the United States.

All shotguns and unused shotgun shells must be returned to the United States. Note that since certain countries may require an Import Certificate or a U.S. export license before allowing the import of a shotgun, you should determine the import requirements of your country of destination in advance.
