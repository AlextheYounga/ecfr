##### § 740.5 Civil end-users (CIV). #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 23472, Apr. 28, 2020.

(a) *Scope.* License Exception CIV authorizes exports and reexports of items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) (supplement no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) that have a license requirement to the ultimate destination pursuant to the Commerce Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) for NS reasons only; and identified by “CIV - Yes” in the License Exception section of the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), provided the items are destined to civil end-users for civil end-uses in Country Group D:1, except North Korea (supplement no. 1 to part 740 of this part).

(b) *Restrictions* - (1) *Restricted end-users and end-uses.* You may not use CIV if you “know” the item will be or is intended to be exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) to military uses or military end-users. Such exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) will continue to require a license. In addition to conventional military activities, military uses include any proliferation activities described and prohibited by part 744 of the EAR.

(2) *Visa status.* Deemed exports under License Exception CIV are not authorized to foreign nationals in an expired visa status. It is the responsibility of the exporter to ensure that, in the case of deemed exports, the foreign national maintains a valid U.S. visa, if required to hold a visa from the United States.

(c) *Reporting requirement.* See § 743.1 of the EAR for reporting requirements for exports of certain items under this License Exception.
