##### § 740.17 Encryption commodities, software, and technology (ENC). #####

License Exception ENC authorizes export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) of systems, equipment, commodities, and components therefor that are classified under ECCNs 5A002, 5B002, equivalent or related software and technology therefor classified under 5D002 or 5E002, and “cryptanalytic items” classified under ECCNs 5A004, 5D002 or 5E002. This License Exception ENC does not authorize export or reexport to, transfer (in-country) in, or provision of any service in any country listed in Country Groups E:1 or E:2 in supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR, or release of source code or technology to any national of a country listed in Country Groups E:1 or E:2. Reexports and transfers (in-country) under License Exception ENC are subject to the criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. Paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section set forth information about classifications required by this section. Items described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(3)(i), (ii), or (iv) of this section that meet the criteria set forth in Note 3 to Category 5 - Part 2 of the Commerce Control List (the “mass market” note) are classified under ECCN 5A992.c or 5D992.c following self-classification or classification by BIS and are no longer subject to “EI” and “NS” controls. Paragraph (e) sets forth reporting required by this section. For items exported under paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(3)(i), (ii), or (iv) of this section and therefore excluded from paragraph (e) reporting requirements, exporters are reminded of the recordkeeping requirements in part 762 of the EAR and that they may be required to make such records available upon request. All classification requests, and reports submitted to BIS pursuant to this section for encryption items will be reviewed by the ENC Encryption Request Coordinator, Ft. Meade, MD.

(a) *No classification request or reporting required.* License Exception ENC authorizes the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to the end users and for the end uses set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section, without submission of a classification request, self-classification report or sales report to BIS.

(1) *Certain exports, reexports, transfers (in-country) to 'private sector end users'* - (i) *Internal “development” or “production” of new products.* License Exception ENC authorizes certain exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of items described in paragraph (a) of this section for the internal “development” or “production” of new products by 'private sector end users,' wherever located, that are headquartered in a country listed in supplement no. 3 of this part.

(ii) *Certain exports, reexports, transfers (in-country) to related parties, not involving “development” or “production” of new products.* For internal end uses among 'private sector end users' other than the “development” or “production” of new products, License Exception ENC authorizes exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of non-U.S.-origin items, described in paragraph (a) of this section, to 'private sector end users' wherever located provided that:

(A) That item became subject to the EAR after it was produced;

(B) All parties to the transaction are subsidiaries of the same parent company headquartered in a country listed in supplement no. 3 of this part; and

(C) The characteristics or capabilities of the existing item are not enhanced, unless otherwise authorized by license or license exception.

Note to paragraph (a)(1):

A 'private sector end user' is either: An individual who is not acting on behalf of any foreign government; or a commercial firm (including its subsidiary and parent firms, and other subsidiaries of the same parent) that is not wholly owned by, otherwise controlled by or acting on behalf of, any foreign government.

(2) *Exports, reexports, transfers (in-country) to “U.S. Subsidiaries.”* License Exception ENC authorizes export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) of items described in paragraph (a) of this section to any “U.S. subsidiary,” wherever located. License Exception ENC also authorizes export, reexport, transfer (in-country) of such items by a U.S. company and its subsidiaries to foreign nationals who are employees, individual contractors or interns of a U.S. company or its subsidiaries if the items are for internal company use, including the “development” or “production” of new products, without prior review by the U.S. Government.

Note to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2):

All items produced or developed with items exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) under paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section are subject to the EAR. These items may require the submission of a classification request before sale, reexport or transfer to non-“U.S. subsidiaries,” unless otherwise authorized by license or license exception.

(3) *Reexports and transfers (in-country) of non-U.S. products developed with or incorporating U.S.-origin encryption source code, components, or toolkits.* License Exception ENC authorizes the reexport and transfer (in-country) of non-U.S. products developed with or incorporating U.S.-origin encryption source code, components or toolkits that are subject to the EAR, provided that the U.S.-origin encryption items have previously been classified or reported and authorized by BIS and the cryptographic functionality has not been changed. Such products include non-U.S. developed products that are designed to operate with U.S. products through a cryptographic interface.

Note to paragraph (a)(3):

This exception from classification and reporting requirements does not apply to non-U.S.-origin products exported from the United States.

(b) *Classification request or self-classification report.* For products described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that are self-classified by the exporter, a self-classification report in accordance with paragraph (e)(3) of this section is required from specified exporters, reexporters and transferors; for products described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section that are classified by BIS via a CCATS, a self-classification report is not required. For products described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, a thirty-day (30-day) classification request is required in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. An exporter, reexporter, or transferor may rely on the producer's self-classification (for products described in (b)(1), only) or CCATS for an encryption item eligible for export or reexport under License Exception ENC under paragraph (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. Exporters are still required to comply with semi-annual sales reporting requirements under paragraph (e)(1) or (2) of this section, even if relying on a CCATS issued to a producer for specified encryption items described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section.

*Note to paragraph (b) introductory text:* Mass market encryption software that would be considered publicly available under § 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR, and is authorized for export under this paragraph (b), remains subject to the EAR until all applicable classification or self-classification requirements set forth in this section are fulfilled.

(1) *Immediate authorization.* This paragraph (b)(1) authorizes the exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of the associated commodities self-classified under ECCNs 5A002.a or 5B002, and equivalent or related software therefor classified under 5D002, except any such commodities, software, or components described in (b)(2) or (3) of this section, subject to submission of a self-classification report in accordance with § 740.17(e)(3) of the EAR. Items described in this paragraph (b)(1) that meet the criteria set forth in Note 3 to Category 5 - Part 2 of the Commerce Control List (the “mass market” note) are classified as ECCN 5A992.c or 5D992.c following self-classification or classification by BIS and are removed from “EI” and “NS” controls.

(2) *Classification request required.* Thirty (30) days after the submission of a classification request with BIS in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and subject to the reporting requirements in paragraph (e) of this section, this paragraph under License Exception ENC authorizes certain exports, reexports, and transfers (in-country) of the items specified in paragraph (b)(2) and submitted for classification.
