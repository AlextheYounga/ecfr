##### ยง 744.20 License requirements that apply to certain sanctioned entities. #####

BIS may impose, as foreign policy controls, export, reexport, and transfer (in-country) license requirements and set licensing policy with respect to certain entities that have been sanctioned by the State Department. Such license requirements and policy are in addition to those imposed elsewhere in the EAR. License requirements and licensing policy may be imposed pursuant to this section even when the sanction and the legal authority under which the State Department imposed the sanction do not require or authorize the imposition of any license requirement or licensing policy. License requirements and licensing policy will be imposed pursuant to this section by adding an entity to the Entity List in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.

(a) *General requirement.* Certain entities that have been sanctioned by the State Department are listed in supplement no. 4 to this part (the Entity List) with a reference to this section. A license is required, to the extent specified on the Entity List, to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item to such entities.

(b) License Exceptions. No license exception may be used to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to such entities unless specifically authorized on the Entity List.

(c) Licensing policy. Applications to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) to such entities will be reviewed according to the licensing policy set forth on the Entity List.
