##### § 744.18 Restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers to persons designated in or pursuant to Executive Order 13315. #####

Consistent with Executive Order (E.O.) 13315 of August 28, 2003 (“Blocking Property of the Former Iraqi Regime, Its Senior Officials and Their Family Members, and Taking Certain Other Actions”), BIS maintains restrictions on exports, reexports, and transfers to persons designated in or pursuant to E.O. 13315. These persons include individuals and entities listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13315, as well as persons subsequently designated pursuant to criteria set forth in the order. OFAC includes the names of persons designated pursuant to E.O. 13315 in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V, which lists persons subject to various sanctions programs administered by OFAC. All persons designated in or pursuant to E.O. 13315 are identified in appendix A by the bracketed initials [IRAQ2].

(a) *License requirements.* (1) A license requirement applies to the export, reexport, or transfer of any item subject to the EAR to—

(i) Persons listed in the Annex to E.O. 13315 of August 28, 2003; or

(ii) Persons determined to be subject to E.O. 13315.

(2) To avoid duplication, U.S. persons are not required to seek separate BIS authorization for an export, reexport, or transfer to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject to both the EAR and regulations maintained by OFAC. Therefore, if OFAC authorizes an export from the United States or an export, reexport, or transfer by a U.S. person to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section, no separate authorization from BIS is necessary.

(3) U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export, reexport, or transfer to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject to the EAR but not subject to regulations maintained by OFAC.

(4) Non-U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export from abroad, reexport, or transfer to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject to the EAR.

(5) Any export, reexport, or transfer to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section by a U.S. person of any item subject both to the EAR and regulations maintained by OFAC and not authorized by OFAC is a violation of the EAR.

(6) Any export, reexport, or transfer by a U.S. person to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject to the EAR that is not subject to regulations maintained by OFAC and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR. Any export from abroad, reexport, or transfer by a non-U.S. person to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject to the EAR and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR.

(7) These licensing requirements supplement any other requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR.

(b) *Exceptions.* No License Exceptions or other BIS authorizations are available for export, reexport, or transfer to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject to the EAR.

(c) *Licensing policy.* Applications for licenses for the export, reexport, or transfer to a person identified in paragraph (a) of this section of any item subject to the EAR will generally be denied. You should consult with OFAC concerning transactions subject to OFAC licensing requirements.

(d) *Contract sanctity.* Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications reviewed under this section.
