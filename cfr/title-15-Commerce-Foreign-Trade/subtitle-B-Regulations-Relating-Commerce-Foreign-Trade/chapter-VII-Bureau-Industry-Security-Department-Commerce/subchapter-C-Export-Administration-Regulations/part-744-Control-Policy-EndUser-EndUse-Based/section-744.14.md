##### § 744.14 Restrictions on exports and reexports to designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). #####

Consistent with the objectives of section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended (INA) (8 U.S.C. 1189), and section 303 of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 1996, as amended (Anti-Terrorism Act) (18 U.S.C. 2339B) (Public Law 104-132. 110 Stat. 1214-1319), BIS maintains restrictions on exports and reexports to organizations designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) pursuant to section 219 of the INA. The Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control, maintains 31 CFR part 597, the Foreign Terrorist Organizations Sanctions Regulations, requiring U.S. financial institutions to block all financial transactions involving assets of designated FTOs within the possession or control of such U.S. financial institutions. Section 303 of the Anti-Terrorism Act prohibits persons within the United States or subject to U.S. jurisdiction from knowingly providing material support or resources to a designated FTO and makes violations punishable by criminal penalties under title 18, United States Code. These designated FTOs are listed in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V and identified by the bracketed initials [FTO]. A designation of a foreign organization determined to meet the criteria of section 219 of the INA takes effect upon publication in the Federal Register by the Secretary of State, or the Secretary's designee.

(a) *License requirement(s).* (1) A license requirement applies to the export or reexport to an FTO of any item subject to the EAR.

(2) U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export or reexport to an FTO of any item subject to the EAR.

(3) Non-U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export from abroad or reexport to an FTO of any item subject to the EAR.

(4) Any export or reexport to an FTO by any person of any item subject to the EAR and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR.

(5) These licensing requirements supplement any other requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR.

(b) *Exceptions.* No License Exceptions or other BIS authorization for items described by paragraph (a) of this section are available for exports or reexports to FTOs.

(c) *Licensing policy.* Applications for exports and reexports to FTOs of all items identified by paragraph (a) of this section will generally be denied, to the extent they constitute material support or resources, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 2339A(b).

(d) *Contract sanctity.* Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications reviewed under this section.

(e) *FTOs also designated as SDTs or SDGTs.* In cases in which an FTO is also an SDT, as described in § 744.13, or an SDGT, as described in § 744.12, the license requirements and licensing policy set forth in § 744.13 or § 744.12 will apply.

Note to § 744.14:

This section does not implement, construe, or limit the scope of any criminal statute, including (but not limited to) 18 U.S.C. 2339B(a)(1) and 2339A, and does not excuse any person from complying with any criminal statute, including (but not limited to) 18 U.S.C. 2339B(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. 2339A.
