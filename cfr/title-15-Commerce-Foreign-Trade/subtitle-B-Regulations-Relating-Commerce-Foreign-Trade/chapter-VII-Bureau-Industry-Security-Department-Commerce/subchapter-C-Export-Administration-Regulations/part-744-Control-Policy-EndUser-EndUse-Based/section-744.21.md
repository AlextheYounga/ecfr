##### § 744.21 Restrictions on certain 'Military end uses' in the People's Republic of China (PRC) or for a 'Military end use' or 'Military end user' in Russia or Venezuela. #####

(a)(1) *General prohibition.* In addition to the license requirements for items specified on the Commerce Control List (CCL), you may not export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any item subject to the EAR listed in supplement no. 2 to part 744 to the PRC, Russia or Venezuela without a license if, at the time of the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country), either:

(i) You have “knowledge,” as defined in § 772.1 of the EAR, that the item is intended, entirely or in part, for a 'military end use,' as defined in paragraph (f) of this section, in the PRC or for a 'military end use' or 'military end user' in Russia or Venezuela; or

(ii) You have been informed by BIS, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, that the item is or may be intended, entirely or in part, for a 'military end use' in the PRC or for a 'military end use' or 'military end-user' in Russia or Venezuela.

(2) *General prohibition.* In addition to the license requirements for 9x515 and “600 series” items specified on the Commerce Control List (CCL), you may not export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) any 9x515 or “600 series” item, including items described in a .y paragraph of a 9x515 or “600 series” ECCN, to the PRC, Russia or Venezuela without a license. The use in, with, or for the International Space Station (ISS) for exports, reexports or transfers within Russia is not within the scope of this paragraph's general prohibition, including launch to the ISS. (*See* § 740.11(e)(1) of the EAR for a definition of the ISS).

(b) *Additional prohibition on those informed by BIS.* BIS may inform you either individually by specific notice, through amendment to the EAR published in the Federal Register, or through a separate notice published in the Federal Register, that a license is required for specific exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) of any item because there is an unacceptable risk of use in or diversion to 'military end use' activities in the PRC or for a 'military end use' or 'military end user' in Russia or Venezuela. Specific notice will be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration or the Deputy Assistant Secretary's designee. The absence of BIS notification does not excuse the exporter from compliance with the license requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) *License exception.* Despite the prohibitions described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you may export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) items subject to the EAR under the provisions of License Exception GOV set forth in § 740.11(b)(2)(i) and (ii) of the EAR.

(d) *License application procedure.* When submitting a license application pursuant to this section, you must state in the “additional information” block of the application that “this application is submitted because of the license requirement in § 744.21 of the EAR (Restrictions on Certain Military End Uses in the People's Republic of China or for a 'Military End Use' or 'Military End User' in Russia or Venezuela).” In addition, either in the additional information block of the application or in an attachment to the application, you must include for the PRC all known information concerning the military end use of the item(s) and for Russia or Venezuela, all known information concerning the 'military end use' and 'military end users' of the item(s). If you submit an attachment with your license application, you must reference the attachment in the “additional information” block of the application.

(e) *License review standards.* (1) Applications to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) items described in paragraph (a) of this section will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) would make a material contribution to the military capabilities of the PRC, Russia, or Venezuela, and would result in advancing the country's military activities contrary to the national security interests of the United States. When it is determined that an export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) would make such a contribution, the license will be denied.

(2) Applications may be reviewed under chemical and biological weapons, nuclear nonproliferation, or missile technology review policies, as set forth in §§ 742.2(b)(4), 742.3(b)(4) and 742.5(b)(4) of the EAR, if the end use may involve certain proliferation activities.

(3) Applications for items requiring a license for other reasons that are destined to the PRC for a 'military end use' or that are destined to Russia or Venezuela for a 'military end use' or 'military end user' also will be subject to the review policy stated in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(f) *Military end use.* In this section, 'military end use' means: incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR part 121, International Traffic in Arms Regulations); incorporation into a military item described on the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement Web site at *http://www.wassenaar.org*); incorporation into items classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs; or for the “use,” “development,” or “production” of military items described on the USML or the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List, or items classified under ECCNs ending in “A018” or under “600 series” ECCNs. 'Military end use' also means deployment of items classified under ECCN 9A991 as set forth in supplement no. 2 to part 744.
