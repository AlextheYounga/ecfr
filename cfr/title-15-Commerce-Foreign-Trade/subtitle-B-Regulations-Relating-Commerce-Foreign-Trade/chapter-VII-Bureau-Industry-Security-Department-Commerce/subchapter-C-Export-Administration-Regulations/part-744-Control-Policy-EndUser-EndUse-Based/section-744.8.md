##### § 744.8 Restrictions on exports and reexports to persons designated pursuant to Executive Order 13382—Blocking Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and Their Supporters. #####

BIS maintains restrictions on exports and reexports to persons designated in or pursuant to Executive Order 13382 of June 28, 2005 (Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and their Supporters). Executive Order 13382 blocks the property and interests in property of persons named in or designated pursuant to Executive Order 13382 in the United States or that comes within the United States or within the possession or control of United States persons. The parties whose property or interests in property are blocked pursuant to Executive Order 13382 are identified by the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD]. This section imposes export and reexport license requirements for items subject to the EAR on those same parties to further the objectives of Executive Order 13382.

(a) *License requirement(s) and authorization*—(1) *EAR license requirement.* A license is required for the export or reexport of any item subject to the EAR to any party listed in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD].

(2) *BIS authorization.* (i) To avoid duplication, U.S. persons are not required to seek separate authorization from BIS for an export or reexport to a party listed in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of an item subject to the EAR. If OFAC authorizes an export from the United States or an export or reexport by a U.S. person to a party listed in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD], such authorization constitutes authorization for purposes of the EAR as well.

(ii) U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export or reexport to a party listed in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to the EAR that is not subject to OFAC's regulatory authority pursuant to Executive Order 13382.

(iii) Non-U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for any export from abroad or reexport to a party listed in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to the EAR.

(iv) Any export or reexport to a party listed in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to the EAR and not authorized by OFAC is a violation of the EAR.

(v) Any export or reexport by a U.S. person to a party listed in appendix A to 31 CFR chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to the EAR that is not subject to regulation by OFAC and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR. Any export from abroad or reexport by a non-U.S. person to a party listed in Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V with the bracketed suffix [NPWMD] of any item subject to the EAR and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR.

(3) *Relation to other EAR license requirements.* The license requirements in this section supplement any other requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR.

(b) *License exceptions.* No license exceptions are available for the EAR license requirements imposed in this section.

(c) *Licensing policy.* Applications for EAR licenses required by this section generally will be denied. You should consult with OFAC concerning transactions subject to OFAC licensing requirements.

(d) *Contract sanctity.* Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications reviewed under this section.
