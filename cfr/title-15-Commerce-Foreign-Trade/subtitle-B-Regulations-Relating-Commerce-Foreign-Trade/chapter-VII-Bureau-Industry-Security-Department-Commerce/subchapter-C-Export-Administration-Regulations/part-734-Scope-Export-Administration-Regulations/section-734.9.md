##### § 734.9 Foreign-Direct Product (FDP) Rules. #####

Foreign-produced items located outside the United States are subject to the EAR when they are a “direct product” of specified “technology” or “software,” or are produced by a plant or 'major component' of a plant that itself is a “direct product” of specified “technology” or “software.” If a foreign-produced item is subject to the EAR, then you should separately determine the license requirements that apply to that foreign-produced item (e.g., by assessing the item classification, destination, end-use, and end-user in the relevant transaction). Not all transactions involving foreign-produced items that are subject to the EAR require a license. Those transactions that do require a license may be eligible for a license exception.
