##### § 743.4 Conventional arms reporting. #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 46594, Aug. 19, 2021.

(a) *Scope.* This section outlines special reporting requirements for exports of certain items listed on the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List and the UN Register of Conventional Arms. Participating States of the Wassenaar Arrangement exchange information every six months on deliveries to non-participating states of conventional arms set forth in the *Wassenaar Arrangement's Basic Documents* under Part II Guideline and Procedures, including the Initial Elements, Appendix 3: Specific Information Exchange on Arms Content by Category (at *www.wassenaar.org*), derived from the categories of the UN Register of Conventional Arms (at *www.un.org/disarmament/convarms/Register/*). Similar, although not identical, information is also reported by the U.S. Government to the United Nations on an annual basis. The reported information should include the quantity and the name of the recipient state and, except in the category of missiles and missile launchers, details of model and type. Such reports must be submitted to BIS semi-annually in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section for items identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and annually for items identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, and records of all exports subject to the reporting requirements of this section must be kept in accordance with part 762 of the EAR. This section does not require reports for reexports or transfers (in-country). This section does not require reports when the exporter uses the alternative submission method described under paragraph (h) of this section. The alternative submission method under paragraph (h) requires the exporter to submit the information required for conventional arms reporting in this section as part of the required EEI submission in AES, pursuant to § 758.1(b)(9) of the EAR. Because of the requirements in § 758.1(g)(4)(ii) of the EAR for the firearms that require conventional arms reporting of all conventional arms, the Department of Commerce believes all conventional arms reporting requirements for firearms will be met by using the alternative submission method. The Department of Commerce leaves standard method for submitting reports in place in case any additional items are moved from the USML to the CCL, that may require conventional arms reporting.

Note 1 to paragraph (a):

For purposes of this section, the term “you” has the same meaning as the term “exporter”, as defined in part 772 of the EAR.

(b) *Requirements.* You must submit one electronic copy of each report required under the provisions of this section, or submit this information using the alternative submission method specified in paragraph (h) of this section, and maintain accurate supporting records (see § 762.2(b) of the EAR) for all exports of items specified in paragraph (c) of this section for the following:

(1) Exports authorized under License Exceptions LVS, TMP, RPL, STA, or GOV (see part 740 of the EAR);

(2) [Reserved]

(3) Exports authorized under the Validated End User authorization (see § 748.15 of the EAR).

(e) *Information that must be included in each report.* (1) Each report submitted to BIS for items other than those identified in paragraph (e)(2) of this section must include the following information for each export during the time periods specified in paragraph (f) of this section:

(ii) Number of units in the shipment; and

Note 2 to paragraph (e)(1)(ii):

For exports of technology for which reports are required under § 743.1(c) of this section, the number of units in the shipment should be reported as one (1) for the initial export of the technology to a single ultimate consignee. Additional exports of the technology must be reported only when the type or scope of technology changes or exports are made to other ultimate consignees.

(iii) Country of ultimate destination.

(f) *Frequency and timing of reports* - (1) *Semi-annual reports for items identified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.* You must submit reports subject to the provisions of this section semiannually. The reports must be labeled with the exporting company's name and address at the top of each page and must include for each such export all the information specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The reports shall cover exports made during six-month time periods from January 1 through June 30 and July 1 through December 31.

(i) The first report must be submitted to and received by BIS no later than 180 days after the effective date of the rule that revises paragraph (c)(1) of this section to add the ECCN for the item being reported. Thereafter, reports are due according to the provisions of paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section.

(ii) Reports for the reporting period ending June 30 must be submitted to and received by BIS no later than August 1.

(iii) Reports for the reporting period ending December 31 must be submitted to and received by BIS no later than February 1.

(2) *Annual reports for items identified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.* You must submit reports subject to the provisions of this section annually.

(g) *Submission of reports.* Information should be submitted in the form of a spreadsheet and emailed to *WAreports@BIS.DOC.GOV* or *UNreports@BIS.DOC.GOV.*

(h) *Alternative submission method.* This paragraph (h) describes an alternative submission method for meeting the conventional arms reporting requirements of this section. The alternative submission method requires the exporter, when filing the required EEI submission in AES, pursuant to § 758.1(b)(9) of the EAR, to include the six character ECCN classification (*i.e.,* 0A501.a or 0A501.b) as the first text to appear in the Commodity description block. If the exporter properly includes this information in the EEI filing in AES, the Department of Commerce will be able to obtain that export information directly from AES to meet the U.S. Government's commitments to the Wassenaar Arrangement and United Nations for conventional arms reporting. An exporter that complies with the requirements in § 758.1(g)(4)(ii) of the EAR does not have to submit separate annual and semi-annual reports to the Department of Commerce pursuant to this section.

Information concerning the reporting requirements for items identified in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section is available from the Office of Nonproliferation and Treaty Compliance (NPTC), Tel.: (202) 482-4188, Fax: (202) 482-4145.
