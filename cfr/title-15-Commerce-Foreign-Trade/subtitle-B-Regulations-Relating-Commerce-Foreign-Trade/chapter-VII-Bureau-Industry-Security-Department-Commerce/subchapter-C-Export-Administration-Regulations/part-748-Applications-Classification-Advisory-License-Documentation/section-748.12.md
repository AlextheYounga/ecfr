Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 4177, Jan. 23, 2020.

(a) *Requirement to obtain document.* Unless an exception in § 748.9(c) applies, an FC Import Certificate is required for license applications for firearms and related commodities, regardless of value, that are destined for member countries of the Organization of American States (OAS). This requirement is consistent with the OAS Model Regulations described in § 742.17 of the EAR.

(1) *Items subject to requirement.* Firearms and related commodities are those commodities controlled for “FC Column 1” reasons under ECCNs 0A984, 0A986, or 0A987.

(2) *Countries subject to requirement.* (i) OAS member countries include: Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

(ii) [Reserved]

(3) *Equivalent official document in place of FC Import Certificate.* For those OAS member countries that have not yet established or implemented an FC Import Certificate procedure, BIS will accept an equivalent official document (*e.g.,* import license or letter of authorization) issued by the government of the importing country as supporting documentation for the export of firearms.

(b) *Obtaining the document.* (1) Applicants must request that the importer (*e.g.,* ultimate consignee or purchaser) obtain the FC Import Certificate or an equivalent official document from the government of the importing country, and that it be issued covering the quantities and types of firearms and related items that the applicant intends to export. (See supplement no. 6 to this part for a list of the OAS member countries' authorities administering the FC Import Certificate System.) Upon receipt of the FC Import Certificate, its official equivalent, or a copy, the importer must provide the original or a certified copy of the FC Import Certificate or the original or a certified copy of the equivalent official document to the license applicant.

(2) If the government of the importing country will not issue an FC Import Certificate or its official equivalent, the applicant must supply the information described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(6) through (c)(8) of this section on company letterhead.

(c) *Content of the document.* The FC Import Certificate or its official equivalent must contain the following information:

(1) Applicant's name and address. The applicant may be either the exporter, supplier, or order party.

(2) FC Import Certificate Identifier/Number.

(3) Name of the country issuing the certificate or unique country code.

(4) Date the FC Import Certificate was issued, in international date format (*e.g.,* 24/12/12 for 24 December 2012, or 3/1/99 for 3 January 1999).

(5) Name of the agency issuing the certificate, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, signing officer name, and signature.

(6) Name of the importer, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, country of residence, representative's name if commercial or government body, citizenship, and signature.

(7) Name of the end user(s), if known and different from the importer, address, telephone and facsimile numbers, country of residence, representative's name if commercial (authorized distributor or reseller) or government body, citizenship, and signature. Note that BIS does not require the identification of each end user when the firearms and related commodities will be resold by a distributor or reseller if unknown at the time of export.

(8) Description of the commodities approved for import including a technical description and total quantity of firearms, parts and components, ammunition and parts.

Note to paragraph (c)(8):

You must furnish the consignee with a detailed technical description of each commodity to be given to the government for its use in issuing the FC Import Certificate. For example, for shotguns, provide the type, barrel length, overall length, number of shots, the manufacturer's name, the country of manufacture, and the serial number for each shotgun. For ammunition, provide the caliber, velocity and force, type of bullet, manufacturer's name and country of manufacture.

(9) Expiration date of the FC Import Certificate in international date format (*e.g.,* 24/12/12) or the date the items must be imported, whichever is earlier.

(10) Name of the country of export (*i.e.,* United States).

(11) Additional information. Certain countries may require the tariff classification number, by class, under the Brussels Convention (Harmonized Tariff Code) or the specific technical description of a commodity. For example, shotguns may need to be described in barrel length, overall length, number of shots, manufacturer's name and country of manufacture. The technical description is not the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN).

(d) *Procedures for using document with license application* - (1) *Information necessary for license application.* The license application must include the same commodities as those listed on the FC Import Certificate or the equivalent official document.

(2) *Alterations.* After an FC Import Certificate or equivalent official document is used to support the issuance of a license, no corrections, additions, or alterations may be made on the FC Import Certificate by any person. Any necessary corrections, additions, or alterations should be noted by the applicant in a separate statement on file with the applicant.

(3) *Validity period.* FC Import Certificates or equivalent official documents issued by an OAS member country will be valid until the expiration date on the Certificate or for a period of four years, whichever is shorter.
