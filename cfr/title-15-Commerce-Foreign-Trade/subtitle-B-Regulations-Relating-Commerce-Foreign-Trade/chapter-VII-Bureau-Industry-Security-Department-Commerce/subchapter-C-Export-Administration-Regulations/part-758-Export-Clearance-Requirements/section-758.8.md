Such person must, as ordered, either:

(1) Return the shipment to the United States or cause it to be returned or;

(2) Unload the shipment at a port of call and take steps to assure that it is placed in custody under bond or other guaranty not to enter the commerce of any foreign country without prior approval of BIS.
