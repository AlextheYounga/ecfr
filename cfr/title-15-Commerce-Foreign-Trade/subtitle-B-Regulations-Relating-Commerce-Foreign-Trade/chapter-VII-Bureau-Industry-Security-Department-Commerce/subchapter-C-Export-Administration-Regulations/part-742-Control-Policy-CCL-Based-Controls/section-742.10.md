##### § 742.10 Anti-terrorism: Sudan. #####

(a) *License requirements.* (1) If AT column 1 or AT column 21 of the Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is required for export to Sudan for anti-terrorism purposes.

1 AT column 1 refers to items controlled to Iran, Sudan, and Syria for anti-terrorism purposes. AT column 2 refers to additional items controlled to Iran and Sudan for anti-terrorism purposes. In addition, items included in ECCNs 2A994, 2D994 and 2E994 are controlled to Iran for anti-terrorism purposes.

(2) If AT column 1 or AT column 2 of the Commerce Country Chart (supplement no. 1 to part 738 of the EAR) is indicated in the appropriate ECCN, a license is required for *reexport* to Sudan for anti-terrorism purposes, *except* for ECCNs 2A994, 3A992.a, 5A991.g, 5A992.c, 5D992.c, 6A991, 6A998, 7A994, 8A992.d, .e, .f, and .g, 9A990.a and .b, and 9A991.d and .e. In addition, items in these ECCNs are not counted as controlled U.S. content for the purpose of determining license requirements for U.S. parts, components or materials incorporated into foreign made products. However, the export from the United States to any destination with knowledge that they will be reexported directly or indirectly, in whole or in part to Sudan is prohibited without a license.

(3) The Secretary of State has designated Sudan as a country whose government has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.

(4) In support of U.S. foreign policy against terrorism, BIS maintains anti-terrorism controls on the export and reexport to Sudan of items described in supplement no. 2 to part 742.

(i) Items described in paragraph (c)(1) through (c)(5) of supplement no. 2 to part 742 if destined to military, police, intelligence or other sensitive end-users in Sudan are controlled under section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act, as amended (EAA).

(ii) Items listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(5) of supplement no. 2 to part 742 destined to other end-users in Sudan, as well as items to all end-users listed in (c)(6) through (c)(14) and (c)(16) through (c)(44) of supplement no. 2 to part 742 are controlled to Sudan under section 6(a) of the EAA.

(b) *Licensing policy* - (1) *General policy of denial.* Applications for export and reexport to all end-users in Sudan of the following items will generally be denied:

(i) Items that are controlled for chemical and biological weapons proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that contain CB Column 1, CB Column 2, or CB Column 3 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.

(ii) Military-related items controlled for national security reasons to any destination. These are items that contain NS Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section in an ECCN on the CCL and are controlled by equipment or material entries ending in the number “18.”

(iii) Items that are controlled for missile proliferation reasons to any destination. These are items that contain a MT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.

(iv) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, all aircraft (powered and unpowered), helicopters, engines and related spare parts and components.

Such items contain an NS Column 1, NS Column 2, or AT Column 1 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL. Note that, consistent with the general rule that applies to computing U.S. parts and components content incorporated in foreign made products, all aircraft-related items that require a license to Sudan will be included as controlled US content for purposes of such license requirements.

(v) Cryptographic, cryptoanalytic, and cryptologic items controlled to any destination. These are items that contain an NS Column 1, NS Column 2, AT Column 1 or AT Column 2 in the Country Chart column of the “License Requirements” section of an ECCN on the CCL.

(2) *Military end-user and end-use policy.* Applications for the export and reexport of all other items described in paragraph (a) of this section, and not described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, will be denied if the export or reexport is destined to a military end-user or for military end-use. Applications for non-military end-users or for non-military end-uses will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

(3) *Other licensing policies.* The licensing policies set forth in this paragraph apply notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

(i) *Case-by-case review policy.* Applications to export or reexport to Sudan will be considered on a case-by-case basis in the four situations described in paragraphs (b)(3)(i)(A) through (D) of this section.

(A) The transaction involves the reexport to Sudan of items where Sudan was not the intended ultimate destination at the time of original export from the United States, provided that the export from the United States occurred prior to the applicable contract sanctity date.

(B) The U.S. content of foreign-produced commodities is 20% or less by value.

(C) The commodities are medical items.

(D) The items are telecommunications equipment and associated computers, software and technology for civil end use, including items useful for the development of civil telecommunications network infrastructure.

Note to paragraph (b)(3)(i).

Applicants seeking approval of their license applications pursuant to this paragraph must include with their applications documentation demonstrating how their proposed transaction is consistent with one or more of the four situations described in this paragraph.

(ii) *General policy of approval.* Applications to export or reexport to Sudan the following for civil uses by non-sensitive end-users within Sudan will be reviewed with a general policy of approval.

(A) Parts, components, materials, equipment, and technology that are controlled on the Commerce Control List (supp. no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) only for anti-terrorism reasons that are intended to ensure the safety of civil aviation or the safe operation of fixed-wing commercial passenger aircraft.

(B) Items controlled on the Commerce Control List (supp. no. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) only for anti-terrorism reasons that will be used to inspect, design, construct, operate, improve, maintain, repair, overhaul or refurbish railroads in Sudan.

Note to paragraph (b)(3)(ii).

Applications will generally be denied for exports or reexports that would substantially benefit a sensitive end user. Sensitive end users include Sudan's military, police, and intelligence services and persons that are owned by or are part of or operated or controlled by those services.

(4) License applications for items reviewed under 6(a) controls will also be reviewed to determine the applicability of 6(j) controls to the transaction. When it is determined that an export or reexport could make a significant contribution to the military potential of Sudan, including its military logistics capability, or could enhance Sudan's ability to support acts of international terrorism, the appropriate committees of the Congress will be notified 30 days before issuance of a license to export or reexport such items.

(c) *Contract sanctity.* Contract sanctity dates and related licensing information for Sudan are set forth in supplement no. 2 to part 742. Applicants who wish a pre-existing contract to be considered must submit sufficient documentation to establish the existence of a contract.

(d) *U.S. controls.* Although the United States seeks cooperation from like-minded countries in maintaining anti-terrorism controls, at this time these controls are maintained only by the United States.
