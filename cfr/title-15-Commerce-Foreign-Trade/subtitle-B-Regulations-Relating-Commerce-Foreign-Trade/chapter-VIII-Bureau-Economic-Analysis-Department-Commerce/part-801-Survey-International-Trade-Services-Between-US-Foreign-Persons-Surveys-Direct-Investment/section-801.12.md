##### § 801.12 Rules and regulations for the BE-140 Benchmark Survey of Insurance Transactions by U.S. Insurance Companies with Foreign Persons - 2018. #####

The BE-140 Benchmark Survey of Insurance Transactions by Insurance Companies with Foreign Persons will be conducted covering calendar year 2018. All legal authorities, provisions, definitions, and requirements contained in §§ 801.1 through 801.2 and §§ 801.4 through 801.6 are applicable to this survey. Specific additional rules and regulations for the BE-140 survey are given in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section. More detailed instructions are given on the report form and in instructions accompanying the report form.

(a) *Response required.* A response is required from U.S. insurance companies subject to the reporting requirements of the BE-140 Benchmark Survey of Insurance Transactions by U.S. Insurance Companies with Foreign Persons - 2018, contained in this section, whether or not they are contacted by BEA. Also, a U.S. insurance company, or its agent, that is contacted by BEA about reporting on this survey, either by sending a report form or by written inquiry, must respond in writing pursuant to this section. This may be accomplished by:

(1) Completing and returning the BE-140 by the due date of the survey; or

(2) If exempt, by completing the determination of reporting status section of the BE-140 survey and returning it to BEA by the due date of the survey.

(b) *Who must report.* A BE-140 report is required of each U.S. insurance company that had insurance transactions with foreign persons in the categories covered by the survey during its 2018 calendar year.

(c) *What must be reported* - (1) *Transactions exceeding $2 million.* A U.S. insurance company that had transactions with foreign persons that exceeded $2 million in at least one of the insurance categories covered by the survey during its 2018 calendar year, on an accrual basis, is required to provide data on the total transactions of each of the covered types of insurance transactions and must disaggregate the totals by country and by relationship to the foreign counterparty (foreign affiliate, foreign parent group, or unaffiliated). The determination of whether a U.S. insurance company is subject to this reporting requirement may be based on the judgment of knowledgeable persons in a company who can identify reportable transactions on a recall basis, with a reasonable degree of certainty, without conducting a detailed manual records search.

(2) *Transactions $2 million or below.* A U.S. insurance company that had transactions with foreign persons that were $2 million or less in each of the insurance categories covered by the survey during its 2018 calendar year, on an accrual basis, is required to provide the total for each type of transaction in which they engaged.

(i) *Voluntary reporting of insurance transactions.* If, during calendar year 2018, total transactions were $2 million or less in each of the insurance categories covered by the survey, on an accrual basis, the U.S. insurance company may, in addition to providing the required total for each type of transaction, voluntarily report transactions at a country and affiliation level of detail on the applicable mandatory schedule(s).

(ii) [Reserved]

(3) *Exemption claims.* Any U.S. person that receives the BE-140 survey form from BEA, but is not subject to the reporting requirements, must file an exemption claim by completing the determination of reporting status section of the BE-140 survey and returning it to BEA by the due date of the survey. The requirement in this paragraph (b)(3) is necessary to ensure compliance with reporting requirements and efficient administration of the Act by eliminating unnecessary follow-up contact.

(d) *Covered types of insurance services.* Insurance services covered by the BE-140 survey consist of transactions between U.S. insurance companies and foreign persons for:

(1) Premiums earned on reinsurance assumed from companies resident abroad;

(2) Losses incurred on reinsurance assumed from companies resident abroad;

(3) Premiums paid for reinsurance ceded to companies resident abroad;

(4) Losses recovered on reinsurance ceded to companies resident abroad;

(5) Premiums earned from direct insurance sold to foreign persons;

(6) Losses incurred on direct insurance sold to foreign persons;

(7) Receipts for auxiliary insurance services provided to foreign persons; and

(8) Payments for auxiliary insurance services provided by foreign persons.

(e) *Types of transactions excluded from the scope of this survey.* Premiums paid to, or losses received from, foreign insurance companies on direct insurance.

(f) *Due date.* A fully completed and certified BE-140 report, or qualifying exemption claim with the determination of reporting status section completed, is due to be filed with BEA not later than September 30, 2019.
