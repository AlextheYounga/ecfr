Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 8527, Feb. 8, 2024.

(a) *In general.* Production activity in zones shall not be conducted without prior authorization from the Board. To obtain authorization, the notification process provided for in §§ 400.22 and 400.37 shall be used. If Board review of a notification under § 400.37 results in a determination that further review is warranted for all or part of the notified activity, the application process pursuant to §§ 400.23, 400.31-400.32, 400.34 and 400.36 shall apply to the activity.

(b) *Scope of authority.* Production activity that may be conducted in a particular zone operation is limited to the specific foreign-status materials and components and specific finished products described in notifications and applications that have been authorized pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, including any applicable prohibitions or restrictions. A determination may be requested pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section as to whether particular activity falls within the scope of authorized activity. Unauthorized activity could be subject to penalties pursuant to the customs regulations on foreign-trade zones (19 CFR part 146).

(c) *Information about authorized production activity.* The Board shall make available via its Web site information regarding the materials, components, and finished products associated with individual production operations authorized under these and previous regulations, as derived from applications and notifications submitted to the Board.

(d) *Scope determinations.* Determinations may be made by the Executive Secretary as to whether changes in activity are within the scope of the production activity already authorized under this part. When warranted, the procedures of §§ 400.32 and 400.34 shall be followed.

(e) *Restrictions on items subject to antidumping and countervailing duty actions*—(1) *Board policy.* Zone procedures shall not be used to circumvent antidumping duty (AD) and countervailing duty (CVD) actions under 19 CFR part 351.

(2) *Admission of items subject to AD/CVD actions.* Items subject to AD/CVD orders, or items which would be otherwise subject to suspension of liquidation under AD/CVD procedures if they entered U.S. customs territory, shall be placed in privileged foreign status (19 CFR 146.41) upon admission to a zone or subzone. Upon entry for consumption, such items shall be subject to duties under AD/CVD orders or to suspension of liquidation, as appropriate, under 19 CFR part 351.
