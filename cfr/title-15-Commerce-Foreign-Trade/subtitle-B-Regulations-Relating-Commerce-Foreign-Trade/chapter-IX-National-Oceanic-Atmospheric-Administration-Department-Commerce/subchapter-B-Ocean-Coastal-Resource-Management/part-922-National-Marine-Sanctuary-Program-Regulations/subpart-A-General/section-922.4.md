##### ยง 922.4 Effect of National Marine Sanctuary designation. #####

The designation of a National Marine Sanctuary, and the regulations implementing it, are binding on any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Designation does not constitute any claim to territorial jurisdiction on the part of the United States for designated sites beyond the U.S. territorial sea, and the regulations implementing the designation shall be applied in accordance with generally recognized principles of international law, and in accordance with treaties, conventions, and other agreements to which the United States is a party. No regulation shall apply to a person who is not a citizen, national, or resident alien of the United States, unless in accordance with:

(a) Generally recognized principles of international law;

(b) An agreement between the United States and the foreign state of which the person is a citizen; or

(c) An agreement between the United States and the flag state of the foreign vessel, if the person is a crew member of the vessel.
