In addition to those definitions found at 15 CFR 922.3, the following definitions apply to this subpart:

*Cruise ship* means a vessel with 250 or more passenger berths for hire.

*Graywater* means galley, bath, or shower water.

*Introduced species* means any species (including but not limited to any of its biological matter capable of propagation) that is non-native to the ecosystems of the Sanctuary; or any organism into which altered genetic matter, or genetic matter from another species, has been transferred in order that the host organism acquires the genetic traits of the transferred genes.

*Motorized personal watercraft* means a vessel, usually less than 16 feet in length, which uses an inboard, internal combustion engine powering a water jet pump as its primary source of propulsion. The vessel is intended to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing or kneeling on the vessel, rather than within the confines of the hull. The length is measured from end to end over the deck excluding sheer, meaning a straight line measurement of the overall length from the foremost part of the vessel to the aftermost part of the vessel, measured parallel to the centerline. Bow sprits, bumpkins, rudders, outboard motor brackets, and similar fittings or attachments, are not included in the measurement. Length is stated in feet and inches.

*Oceangoing ship* means a private, commercial, government, or military vessel of 300 gross registered tons or more, not including cruise ships.

*Pelagic finfish* are defined as: Northern anchovy (*Engraulis mordax*), barracudas (*Sphyraena spp.*), billfishes (family *Istiophoridae*), dolphinfish (*Coryphaena hippurus*), Pacific herring (*Clupea pallasi*), jack mackerel (*Trachurus symmetricus*), Pacific mackerel (*Scomber japonicus*), salmon (*Oncorhynchus spp.*), Pacific sardine (*Sardinops sagax*), blue shark (*Prionace glauca*), salmon shark (*Lamna ditropis*), shortfin mako shark (*Isurus oxyrinchus*), thresher sharks (*Alopias spp.*), swordfish (*Xiphias gladius*), tunas (family *Scombridae*), and yellowtail (*Seriola lalandi*).

*Stowed and not available for immediate use* means not readily accessible for immediate use, e.g., by being securely covered and lashed to a deck or bulkhead, tied down, unbaited, unloaded, or partially disassembled (such as spear shafts being kept separate from spear guns).
