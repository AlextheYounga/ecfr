##### ยง 970.514 Scale requiring application procedures. #####

(a) A proposal by the Administrator to modify a term, condition or restriction in a license pursuant to ยง 970.512, or an application by a licensee for revision of a license or exploration plan pursuant to ยง 970.513, is significant, and the full application requirements and procedures will apply, if it would result in other than an incidental:

(1) Increase in the size of the exploration area; or

(2) Change in the location of the area.

An incidental increase or change is that which equals two percent or less of the original exploration area, so long as such adjustment is contiguous to the licensed area.

(b) All proposed modifications or revisions other than described in paragraph (a) of this section will be acted on after a notice thereof is published by the Administrator in the Federal Register, with a 60-day opportunity for public comment. On a case-by-case basis, the Administrator will determine if other procedures, such as a public hearing in a potentially affected area, are warranted. Notice of the Administrator's decision on the proposed modification will be provided to the licensee in writing and published in the Federal Register.
