##### ยง 960.5 Confidentiality of information. #####

(a) Any proprietary information related to a license application, application for amendment, foreign agreement, or any other supporting documentation submitted to NOAA will be treated as business confidential or proprietary information, if that information is explicitly designated and marked as such by the submitter. This does not preclude the United States Government from citing information in the public domain provided by the licensee in another venue (e.g., the licensee's Web site or a press release).

(b) Within thirty (30) days of the issuance of a license to operate a remote sensing space system, the licensee shall provide the Assistant Administrator with a publicly-releasable summary of the licensed system. The summary must be submitted in a readily reproducible form accompanied by a copy on electronic media. This summary shall be available for public review at a location designated by the Assistant Administrator and shall include:

(1) The name, mailing address and telephone number of the licensee and any affiliates or subsidiaries;

(2) A general description of the system, its orbit(s) and the type of data to be acquired; and

(3) The name and address upon whom service of all documents may be made.
