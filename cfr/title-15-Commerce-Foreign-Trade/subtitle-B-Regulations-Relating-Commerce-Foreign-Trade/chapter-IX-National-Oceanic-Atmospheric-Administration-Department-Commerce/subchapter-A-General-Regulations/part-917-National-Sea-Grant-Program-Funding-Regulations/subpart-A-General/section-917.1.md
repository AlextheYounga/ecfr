##### § 917.1 Basic provisions. #####

(a) This section sets forth the basic purposes for which Sea Grant funding may be made pursuant to the following sections of the Act: 33 U.S.C. 1124, 1127, 1125 and 1124a. These sections provide for the funding of programs and projects in fields related to ocean and coastal resources that involve marine research, marine education and training, and marine advisory services. However, there is a significant difference in focus among these sections since section 1124(a) is concerned chiefly with regional and state needs relative to ocean and coastal resources (including the funding of Sea Grant Fellowships under section 1127) while section 1125 is concerned with national needs and problems relative to ocean and coastal resources, and section 1124a is concerned with programs of international cooperation assistance with respect to those resources.

(b) *Comment:* Statutory citation 33 U.S.C. 1124(a):

(1) Implement the objective set forth in Section 202(b); and

(2) Be responsive to the needs or problems of individual states or regions.

The total amount paid pursuant to any such grant or contract may equal 662/3 percent, or any lesser percent, of the total cost of the Sea Grant program or project involved.
