The postmaster is required to deliver the proof of filing citations or exemption legends prior to export.

(b) *Pipeline exports.* The proof of filing citations or exemption and exclusion legends for items being sent by pipeline shall be presented to the operator of a pipeline no later than four calendar days after the close of the month.
