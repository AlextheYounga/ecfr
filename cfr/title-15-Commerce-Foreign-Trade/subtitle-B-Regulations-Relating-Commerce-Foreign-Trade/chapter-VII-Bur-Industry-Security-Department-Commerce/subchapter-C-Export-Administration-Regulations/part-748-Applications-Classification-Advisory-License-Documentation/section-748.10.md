##### § 748.10 People's Republic of China (PRC) End-User Statement. #####

(a) *Requirement to obtain document.* Unless the provisions of § 748.9(c) or § 748.11(a)(2) apply, a PRC End-User Statement is required for license applications including any of the following commodities destined for the PRC:

(1) Cameras classified under ECCN 6A003 requiring a license to the PRC for any reason, and the value of such cameras exceeds $5,000;

(2) Computers requiring a license to the PRC for any reason, regardless of the value of the computers; or

(3) Any commodity(ies) requiring a license to the PRC for any reason on the Commerce Control List, and the total value of such commodity(ies) requiring a license exceeds $50,000.

Note 1 to paragraph (a):

If an order meets the commodity(ies) and value requirements listed above, then a PRC End-User Statement is required. An order may not be split into multiple license applications solely to avoid a requirement to obtain a PRC End-User Statement.

Note 2 to paragraph (a):

If an order includes both items that do require a license to the PRC and items that do not require a license to the PRC, the value of the latter items should not be factored into the value thresholds described above. Also, if a license application includes 6A003 cameras and other items requiring a license to the PRC, then the value of the 6A003 cameras should be factored into the value threshold described in paragraph (a)(3).

Note 3 to paragraph (a):

See § 748.11(a)(2) for permissive use of a Statement by Ultimate Consignee and Purchaser in place of a PRC End-User Statement.

Note 4 to paragraph (a):

On a case-by-case basis, BIS may require license applicants to obtain a PRC End-User Statement for a license application that would not otherwise require a PRC End-User Statement under the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

Note 5 to paragraph (a):

This requirement to obtain an end-user statement from the PRC Ministry of Commerce does not apply to transactions destined to the PRC Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong.

(b) *Obtaining the document.* (1) If a PRC End-User Statement is required for any reason under paragraph (a) of this section, then applicants must request that the importer obtain a PRC End-User Statement for all items on a license application that require a license to the PRC for any reason listed on the CCL.
