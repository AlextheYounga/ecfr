##### ยง 744.13 Restrictions on exports and reexports to persons designated pursuant to Executive Order 12947 (Specially Designated Terrorist) (SDT). #####

Consistent with the purpose of Executive Order 12947 of January 23, 1995, BIS maintains restrictions on exports and reexports to Specially Designated Terrorists (SDTs). Executive Order 12947 prohibits transactions by U.S. persons with terrorists who threaten to disrupt the Middle East peace process. Pursuant to the Executive Order, the Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), maintains 31 CFR part 595, the Terrorism Sanctions Regulations. In Appendix A to 31 CFR Chapter V, pursuant to 31 CFR part 595, these Specially Designated Terrorists are identified by the bracketed suffix initials [SDT]. The requirements set forth below further the objectives of Executive Order 12947.

(a) *License requirement(s).* (1) A license requirement applies to the export or reexport to an SDT of any item subject to the EAR.

(2) To avoid duplication, U.S. persons are not required to seek separate authorization for an export or reexport to an SDT of an item subject both to the EAR and to OFAC's Terrorism Sanctions Regulations in 31 CFR part 595. Therefore, if OFAC authorizes an export or reexport of an item by a U.S. person to a SDT, no separate authorization from BIS is necessary.

(3) U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export or reexport to an SDT of an item subject to the EAR but not subject to OFAC's Terrorism Sanctions Regulations in 31 CFR part 595.

(4) Non-U.S. persons must seek authorization from BIS for the export from abroad or reexport to an SDT of any item subject to the EAR.

(5) Any export or reexport to an SDT by a U.S. person of any item subject both to the EAR and OFAC's Terrorism Sanctions Regulations in 31 CFR part 595 and not authorized by OFAC is a violation of the EAR.

(6) Any export or reexport by a U.S. person to an SDT of any item subject to the EAR that is not subject to OFAC's Terrorism Sanctions Regulations in 31 CFR part 595 and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR. Any export from abroad or reexport by a non-U.S. person to an SDT of any item subject to the EAR and not authorized by BIS is a violation of the EAR.

(7) These licensing requirements supplement any other requirements set forth elsewhere in the EAR.

(b) *Exceptions.* No License Exceptions or other BIS authorization are available for export or reexport to an SDT of any item subject to the EAR.

(c) *Licensing policy.* Applications for licenses for the export or reexport to an SDT of any item subject to the EAR generally will be denied. You should consult with OFAC concerning transactions subject to OFAC licensing requirements.

(d) *Contract sanctity.* Contract sanctity provisions are not available for license applications reviewed under this section.
