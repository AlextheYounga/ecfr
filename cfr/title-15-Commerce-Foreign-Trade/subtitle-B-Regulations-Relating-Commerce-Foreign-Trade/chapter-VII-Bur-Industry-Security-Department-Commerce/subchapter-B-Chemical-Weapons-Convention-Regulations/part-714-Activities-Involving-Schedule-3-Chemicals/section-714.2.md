##### § 714.2 Annual reporting requirements for exports and imports in excess of 30 metric tons of Schedule 3 chemicals. #####

(a) Any person subject to the CWCR that exported from or imported into the United States in excess of 30 metric tons of any single Schedule 3 chemical during the previous calendar year has a reporting requirement under this section.

(1) *Annual report on exports and imports.* Declared plant sites, undeclared plant sites, trading companies, or any other person subject to the CWCR that exported from or imported into the United States in excess of 30 metric tons of any single Schedule 3 chemical during the previous calendar year must submit an annual report on exports and imports.

Note 1 to § 714.2(a)(1):

Declared and undeclared plant sites must count, for reporting purposes, all exports from and imports to the entire plant site, not only from or to individual plants on the plant site.

Note 2 to § 714.2(a)(1):

The U.S. Government will not submit to the OPCW company-specific information relating to the export or import of Schedule 3 chemicals contained in reports. The U.S. Government will add all export and import information contained in reports to establish the U.S. national aggregate declaration on exports and imports.

(2) *Mixtures containing a Schedule 3 chemical.* The quantity of a Schedule 3 chemical contained in a mixture must be counted for reporting an export or import only if the concentration of the Schedule 3 chemical in the mixture is 80% or more by volume or by weight, whichever yields the lesser percent. For reporting purposes, only count the weight of the Schedule 3 chemical in the mixture, not the entire weight of the mixture.

Note to § 714.2(a)(2):

The “80% and above” mixtures rule applies only for reporting purposes. This rule does not apply for purposes of determining whether the export of your mixture to a non-State Party requires an End-Use Certificate or for determining whether you need an export license from BIS (see 15 CFR 742.2, 742.18 and 745.2 of the Export Administration Regulations) or from the Department of State (see the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 130)).

(b) *Types of forms to be used*—(1) *Declared Schedule 3 plant sites.* (i) If your plant site is declared for production of a Schedule 3 chemical (and has completed questions 3-3.1 and 3-3.2 on Form 3-3) and you also exported from or imported to your plant site in excess of 30 metric tons of that same Schedule 3 chemical, you must report the export or import by either:

(A) Completing question 3-3.3 on Form 3-3 on your declaration for that same Schedule 3 chemical; or

(B) Submitting, separately from your declaration, a Certification Form, Form 3-1, and a Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.

(ii) If your plant site is declared for production of a Schedule 3 chemical and you exported or imported in excess of 30 metric tons of a different Schedule 3 chemical, you must report the export or import by either:

(A) Submitting, along with your declaration, a Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional; or

(B) Submitting, separately from your declaration, a Certification Form, Form 3-1 and a Form 3.3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.

(2) If you are an undeclared plant site, a trading company, or any other person subject to the CWCR, you must submit a Certification Form, Form 3-1, and a Form 3-3 for each Schedule 3 chemical to be reported, completing only question 3-3.3. Attach Form A, as appropriate; Form B is optional.

(c) *Quantities to be reported*—(1) *Calculations.* If you exported from or imported to your plant site or trading company more than 30 metric tons of a Schedule 3 chemical in the previous calendar year, you must report all exports and imports of that chemical by country of destination or country of origin, respectively, and indicate the total amount exported to or imported from each country.

(2) *Rounding.* For purposes of reporting exports and imports of a Schedule 3 chemical, you must total all exports and imports per calendar year per recipient or source and then round to the nearest 0.1 metric tons.

Note to § 714.2(c):

Under the Convention, the United States is obligated to provide the OPCW a national aggregate annual declaration of the quantities of each Schedule 3 chemical exported and imported, with a quantitative breakdown for each country or destination involved. The U.S. Government will *not* submit your company-specific information relating to the export or import of a Schedule 3 chemical reported under this § 714.2. The U.S. Government will add all export and import information submitted by various facilities under this section to produce a national aggregate annual declaration of destination-by-destination trade for each Schedule 3 chemical.
