##### § 335.6 Surrender, reallocation and license utilization requirement. #####

(a) Not later than September 30 of each Tariff Rate Quota Year, a Licensee that will not import the full quantity granted in a license during the Tariff Rate Quota Year shall surrender the allocation that will not be used to the Department for purposes of reallocation through a written or electronic notice to the Department, including the license control number and the amount being surrendered. The surrender shall be final, and shall apply only to that Tariff Rate Quota Year.

(b) For purposes of this section, “unused allocation” means the amount by which the quantity set forth in a license, including any additional amount received pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, exceeds the quantity entered under the license, excluding any amount surrendered pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The Department will notify Licensees of any amount surrendered and the application period for requests for reallocation. A Licensee that has imported, or intends to import, a quantity of Worsted Wool Fabric exceeding the quantity set forth in its license may apply to receive additional allocation from the amount to be reallocated. The application shall state the maximum amount of additional allocation the applicant will be able to use.

(d) The amount surrendered will be reallocated to Licensees that have applied for reallocation. The entire amount surrendered will be reallocated pro-rata among applicants based on the applicant's share of the annual allocation, but will not exceed the amount set forth in the reallocation application as the maximum amount able to be used.

(e) A Licensee whose unused allocation in a Tariff Rate Quota Year exceeds five percent of the quantity set forth in its license shall be subject to having its allocation reduced in the subsequent Tariff Rate Quota Year. The subsequent Tariff Rate Quota Year allocation will be reduced from the quantity such Licensee would otherwise have received by a quantity equal to 25 percent of its unused allocation from the prior year. A Licensee whose unused allocation in two or more consecutive Tariff Rate Quota Years exceeds five percent of the quantity set forth in its license shall have its allocation reduced in the subsequent Tariff Rate Quota Year by a quantity equal to 50 percent of its unused allocation from the prior year.

(f) No penalty will be imposed under paragraph (e) of this section if the Licensee demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Department that the unused allocation resulted from breach by a carrier of its contract of carriage, breach by a supplier of its contract to supply the fabric, act of God, or force majeure.
