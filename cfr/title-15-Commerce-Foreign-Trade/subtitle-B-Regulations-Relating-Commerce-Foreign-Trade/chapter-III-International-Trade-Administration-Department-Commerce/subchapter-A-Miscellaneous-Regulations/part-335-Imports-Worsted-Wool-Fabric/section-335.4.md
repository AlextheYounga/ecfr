##### ยง 335.4 Allocation. #####

(a) For HTS 9902.51.11 and HTS 9902.51.15 each Tariff Rate Quota will be allocated separately. Allocation will be based on an applicant's Worsted Wool Suit production, on a weighted average basis, and the proportion of imported Worsted Wool Fabric consumed in the production of Worsted Wool Suits. In regards to HTS 9902.51.16 the Tariff Rate Quota will be allocated based on an applicant's Worsted Wool Fabric production, on a weighted average basis.

(b) For the purpose of calculating allocations for HTS 9902.51.11 and HTS 9902.51.15 only, Worsted Wool Suit production will be increased by the percentage of imported fabric consumed in the production of Worsted Wool Suits to total fabric consumed in this production. For example, if an applicant uses 30 percent imported fabric in the production of Worsted Wool Suits, that applicant's production level will be increased by 30 percent.

(c) The Department will cause to be published in the Federal Register its determination to allocate the Tariff Rate Quotas and will notify applicants of their respective allocation as soon as possible. Promptly thereafter, the Department will issue licenses.
