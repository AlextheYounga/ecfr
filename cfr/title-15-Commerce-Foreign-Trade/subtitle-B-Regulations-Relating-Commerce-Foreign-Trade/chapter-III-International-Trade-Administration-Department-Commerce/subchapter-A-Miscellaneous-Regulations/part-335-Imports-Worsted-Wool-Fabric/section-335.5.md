(a) Each Licensee will receive a license, which will include a unique control number. The license is subject to the surrender and reallocation provisions in ยง 335.6.

(c) A Licensee may import fabric certified by the importer as suitable for use in making suits, suit-type jackets, or trousers under the appropriate Tariff Rate Quota as specified in the license (*i.e.,* under the Tariff Rate Quota for fabric of worsted wool with average fiber diameters greater than 18.5 micron or the Tariff Rate Quota for fabric of worsted wool with average fiber diameters of 18.5 micron or less) up to the quantity specified in the license subject to the Tariff Rate Quota duty rate. Only a Licensee or an importer authorized by a Licensee will be permitted to import fabric under the Tariff Rate Quotas and to receive the Tariff Rate Quota duty rate.

(d) The term of a license shall be the Tariff Rate Quota Year for which it is issued. Fabric may be entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption under a license only during the term of that license.

(e) The importer of record of fabric entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption under a license must be the Licensee or an importer authorized by the Licensee to act on its behalf. If the importer of record is the Licensee, the importer must possess the license at the time of filing the entry summary or warehouse withdrawal for consumption (Customs Form 7501).

(f) A Licensee may only authorize an importer to import fabric under the license on its behalf by making such an authorization in writing or by electronic notice to the importer and providing a copy of such authorization to the Department. A Licensee may only withdraw authorization from an importer by notifying the importer, in writing or by electronic notice, and providing a copy to the Department.

(g) The written authorization must include the unique number of the license, must specifically cover the type of fabric imported, and must be in the possession of the importer at the time of filing the entry summary or warehouse withdrawal for consumption (Customs Form 7501), or its electronic equivalent, in order for the importer to obtain the applicable Tariff Rate Quota duty rate.
