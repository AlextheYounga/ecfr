##### ยง 241.5 Standard dimensions. #####

Whenever in the rules and regulations in this part the error on a dimension is mentioned, this error shall be determined by taking the difference between the actual measured dimension and the standard dimension. The error is an error in excess and is to be preceded by a plus sign when the measured dimension is greater than the standard dimension. The error is an error in deficiency and is to be preceded by a minus sign when the measured dimension is less than the standard dimension.

(a) The standard dimensions of a barrel for fruits, vegetables, and other dry commodities other than cranberries, and of a barrel for cranberries, with which the actual measured dimensions are to be compared, are as follows:

|                Dimensions                 |Barrel for fruits, vegetables, and other dry commodities other than cranberries (inches)|Barrel for cranberries (inches)|
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|             Diameter of head              |                                         171/8                                          |             161/4             |
| Effective diameter of head (see ยง 241.4)  |                                         163/4                                          |             157/8             |

|Circumference of bulge, outside measurement|                                           64                                           |             581/2             |
|              Length of stave              |                                         281/2                                          |             281/2             |

(b) In the case of all subdivisions of the barrel for fruits, vegetables, and other dry commodities other than cranberries, and all subdivisions of the barrel for cranberries, the following dimensions are hereby standardized for the purpose of the application of tolerances, and the actual measured dimensions are to be compared with these:

|                Dimensions                 |3/4 barrel (inches)|1/2 barrel (inches)|1/3 barrel (inches)|
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Effective diameter of head (see ยง 241.4)  |       151/4       |       133/8       |       115/8       |
|          Distance between heads           |       231/2       |       201/2       |        18         |
|Circumference of bulge, outside measurement|       581/2       |       511/2       |       451/4       |
|**Subdivisions of Barrel for Cranberries** |                   |                   |                   |
| Effective diameter of head (see ยง 241.4)  |       143/8       |       125/8       |        11         |
|          Distance between heads           |        23         |        20         |       171/2       |
|Circumference of bulge, outside measurement|       533/8       |        47         |       413/8       |
