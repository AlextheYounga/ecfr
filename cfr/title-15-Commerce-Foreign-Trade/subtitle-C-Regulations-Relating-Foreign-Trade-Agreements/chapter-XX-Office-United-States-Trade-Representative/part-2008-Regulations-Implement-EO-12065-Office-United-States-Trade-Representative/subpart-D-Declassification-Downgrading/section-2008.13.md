##### ยง 2008.13 Systematic review guidelines. #####

Within 180 days after the effective date of the order, the Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations shall, after consultation with the Archivist of the United States and review by the Information Security Oversight Office, issue and maintain guidelines for systematic review of classified information originated by the Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations twenty years from the date of original classification. These guidelines shall state specific limited categories of information which, because of their national security sensitivity, should not be declassified automatically but should be reviewed item-by-item to determine whether continued protection beyond twenty years is needed. Information not identified in these guidelines as requiring review and for which a prior automatic declassification date has not been established shall be declassified automatically twenty years from the date of original classification.
