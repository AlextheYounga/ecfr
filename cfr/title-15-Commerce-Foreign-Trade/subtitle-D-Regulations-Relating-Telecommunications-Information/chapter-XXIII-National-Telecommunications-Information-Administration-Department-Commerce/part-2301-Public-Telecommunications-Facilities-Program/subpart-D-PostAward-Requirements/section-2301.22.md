##### ยง 2301.22 Protection, acquisition, and substitution of equipment. #####

(a) To assure that the Federal investment in public telecommunications facilities funded under the Act will continue to be used to provide public telecommunications services to the public during the Federal interest period, the Agency may require a grantee to:

(1) Execute and record a document establishing that the Federal government has a priority lien on any facilities purchased with funds under the Act during the period of continuing Federal interest. The document shall be recorded where liens are normally recorded in the community where the facility is located and in the community where the grantee's headquarters are located; and

(2) File a certified copy of the recorded lien with the Administrator ninety (90) days after the grant award is received.

(b) The grantee shall maintain protection against common hazards through adequate insurance coverage or other equivalent undertakings, except that, to the extent the applicant follows a different policy of protection with respect to its other property, the applicant may extend such policy to apparatus acquired and installed under the project. The grantee shall purchase flood insurance (in communities where such insurance is available) if the facilities will be constructed in any area that has been identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards.

(c) The grantee shall not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests in the equipment acquired under this grant during the Federal interest period.

(d) The grantee shall demonstrate that the grantee has obtained appropriate title or lease satisfactory to protect the Federal interest to the site or sites on which apparatus proposed in the project will be operated. The grantee must have the right to occupy, construct, maintain, operate, inspect, and remove the project equipment without impediment to assure the sufficient continuity of operation of the facility; and nothing must prevent the Federal government from entering the property and reclaiming or securing PTFP-funded property.

(e) The Agency will allow the acquisition of facilities by lease; however, the following requirements apply:

(1) The lease must be of benefit to the Federal government;

(2) The actual amount of the lease must not be more than the outright purchase price would be; and

(3) The lease agreement must state that in the event of anticipated or actual termination of the lease, the Federal government has the right to transfer and assign the leasehold to a new grantee for the duration of the lease contract.

(f) *Transfer of equipment.* Where the grant equipment is no longer needed for the original purposes of the project, the Department may transfer the equipment to the Federal government or an eligible third party, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget guidelines.

(g) *Transfer of Federal interest to different equipment.* The Department may transfer the Federal interest in PTFP-funded equipment to other eligible equipment presently owned or to be purchased by the grantee with non-Federal monies, provided the following conditions are met:

(1) If the Federal interest is to be transferred to other equipment presently owned or to be purchased by a grantee, the Federal interest in the new equipment must be at least equal to the Federal interest in the original equipment.

(2) Equipment previously funded by PTFP that is within the Federal interest period may not be used in a transfer request as the designated equipment to which the Federal interest is to be transferred.

(3) The same item can be used only once to substitute for the Federal interest. However, the Federal interest in several items of equipment from different grants may be transferred to a single item if the request for all such transfers is submitted at the same time.

(4) A lien on equipment transferred to the Federal interest may be required by PTFP and must be recorded in accordance with ยง 2301.23(b)(8). A copy of the lien document must be filed with the PTFP within sixty (60) days of the date of approval of the transfer of Federal interest.

(h) *Termination by buy-out.* A grantee may terminate the Federal revisionary interest in a PTFP grant by buying out the Federal interest with non-Federal monies. Buy-outs may be requested at any time.
