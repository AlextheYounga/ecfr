##### ยง 2301.12 Federal Communications Commission authorizations. #####

(a) Each applicant whose project requires FCC authorization must file an application for that authorization on or before the closing date. NTIA recommends that its applicants submit PTFP-related FCC applications to the FCC at least 60 days prior to the PTFP closing date. The applicant should clearly identify itself to the FCC as a PTFP applicant.

(b) In the case of FCC authorizations where it is not possible or practical to submit the FCC license application with the PTFP application, such as C-band satellite uplinks, low-power television stations and translators, remote pickups, studio-to-transmitter links, and Very Small Aperture Terminals, a copy of the FCC application as it will be submitted to the FCC, or the equivalent engineering data, must be included in the PTFP application.

(c) Applications requesting C-band downlinks are not required to submit the FCC application or equivalent engineering data as part of the PTFP application. When such a project is funded, however, grantees will be required to submit evidence of FCC registration of the C-band downlink prior to the release of Federal funds.

(d) Any FCC authorization required for the project must be in the name of the applicant for the PTFP grant.

(e) If the project is to be associated with an existing station, the FCC operating authority for that station must be current and valid.

(f) For any project requiring new authorization(s) from the FCC, the applicant must file a copy of each FCC application and any amendments with the Agency.

(g) If the applicant fails to file the required FCC application(s) by the closing date, or if the FCC returns, dismisses, or denies an application required for the project or any part thereof, or for the operation of the station with which the project is associ ated, the Agency may reject and return the application.

(h) No grant will be awarded until confirmation has been received from the FCC that any necessary authorization will be issued.
