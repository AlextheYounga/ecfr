Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 21022, Apr. 11, 2022.

(a) All applications for registration shall be submitted for filing to the Registration Unit, Drug Enforcement Administration. The appropriate registration fee and any required attachments must accompany the application. See the Table of DEA Mailing Addresses in ยง 1321.01 of this chapter for the current mailing address.

(b) Any person required to obtain more than one registration may submit all applications in one package. Each application must be complete and should not refer to any accompanying application for required information.

(c) Applications submitted for filing are dated upon receipt. If found to be complete, the application will be accepted for filing. Applications failing to comply with the requirements of this part will not generally be accepted for filing. In the case of minor defects as to completeness, the Administrator may accept the application for filing with a request to the applicant for additional information. A defective application will be returned to the applicant within 10 days following its receipt with a statement of the reason for not accepting the application for filing. A defective application may be corrected and resubmitted for filing at any time; the Administrator shall accept for filing any application upon resubmission by the applicant, whether complete or not.

(d) Accepting an application for filing does not preclude any subsequent request for additional information pursuant to ยง 1301.15 and has no bearing on whether the application will be granted.
