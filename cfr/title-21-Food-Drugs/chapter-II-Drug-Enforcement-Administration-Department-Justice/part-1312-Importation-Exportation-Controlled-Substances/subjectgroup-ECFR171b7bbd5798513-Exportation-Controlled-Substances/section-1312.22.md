Forms may be obtained from, and shall be filed with, the Import/Export Unit, Drug Enforcement Administration.

Each application shall show the exporter's name, address, and registration number; a detailed description of each controlled substance desired to be exported including the drug name, dosage form, National Drug Code (NDC) number (in accordance with Food and Drug Administration regulations), the Administration Controlled Substance Code Number as set forth in Part 1308 of this chapter, the number and size of packages or containers, the name and quantity of the controlled substance contained in any finished dosage units, and the quantity of any controlled substance (expressed in anhydrous acid, base, or alkaloid) given in kilograms or parts thereof. The application shall include the name, address, and business of the consignee, foreign port of entry, the port of exportation, the approximate date of exportation, the name of the exporting carrier or vessel (if known, or if unknown it should be stated whether shipment will be made by express, freight, or otherwise, exports of controlled substances by mail being prohibited), the date and number, if any, of the supporting foreign import license or permit accompanying the application, and the authority by whom such foreign license or permit was issued. The application shall also contain an affidavit that the packages are labeled in conformance with obligations of the United States under international treaties, conventions, or protocols in effect on May 1, 1971.

In the case of exportation of crude cocaine, the affidavit may state that to the best of affiant's knowledge and belief, the controlled substances will be processed within the country to which exported, either for medical or scientific use within that country or for reexportation in accordance with the laws of that country to another for medical or scientific use within that country.

See the Table of DEA Mailing Addresses in § 1321.01 of this chapter for the current mailing address. The Administration will evaluate the request after considering all the facts as well as the exporter's registration status with the Administration. If the exporter provides sufficient documentation, the Administration will issue an import permit for the return of these drugs, and the exporter can then obtain an export permit from the country of original importation. The substance may be returned to the United States only after affirmative authorization is issued in writing by the Administration.

(e) In considering whether to grant an application for a permit under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the Administration shall consider whether the applicant has previously obtained such a permit and, if so, whether the applicant complied fully with the requirements of this section with respect to that previous permit.
