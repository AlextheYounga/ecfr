Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 51375, Sept. 30, 2019.

(a) A DEA Form 222 must not be filled if either of the following apply:

(1) The order is not complete, legible, or properly prepared, executed, or endorsed.

(2) The order shows any alteration, erasure, or change of any description.

(b) If a DEA Form 222 cannot be filled for any reason under this section, the supplier must return Copies 1 and 2 to the purchaser with a statement as to the reason (e.g., illegible or altered).

(c) A supplier may for any reason refuse to accept any order and if a supplier refuses to accept the order, a statement that the order is not accepted is sufficient for purposes of this paragraph.

(d) When a purchaser receives an unaccepted order, Copies 1 and 2 of the DEA Form 222 and the statement must be attached to Copy 3 and retained in the files of the purchaser in accordance with § 1305.17. A defective DEA Form 222 may not be corrected; it must be replaced by a new DEA Form 222 for the order to be filled.
