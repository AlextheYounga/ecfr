##### ยง 556.375 Maduramicin ammonium. #####

A tolerance is established for residues of maduramicin ammonium in chickens as follows:

(a) A tolerance for maduramicin ammonium (marker residue) in chickens is 0.38 parts per million in fat (target tissue). A tolerance refers to the concentration of marker residues in the target tissue used to monitor for total drug residues in the target animals.

(b) The safe concentrations for total maduramicin ammonium residues in uncooked edible chicken tissues are: 0.24 parts per million in muscle; 0.72 parts per million in liver; 0.48 parts per million in skin; and 0.48 parts per million in fat. A safe concentration refers to the total residue concentration considered safe in edible tissues.
