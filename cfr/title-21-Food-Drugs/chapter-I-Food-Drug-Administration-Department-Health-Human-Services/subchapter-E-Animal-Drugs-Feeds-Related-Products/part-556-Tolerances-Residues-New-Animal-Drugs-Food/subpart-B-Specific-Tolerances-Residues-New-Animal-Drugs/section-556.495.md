##### ยง 556.495 Oxfendazole. #####

*Cattle:* A tolerance is established for total oxfendazole residues in edible cattle tissues based on a marker residue concentration of 0.8 part per million (ppm) fenbendazole in the target liver tissue. A fenbendazole concentration of 0.8 ppm in liver corresponds to a total safe concentration of oxfendazole residues of 1.7 ppm in liver. The safe concentrations of total oxfendazole residues in other uncooked edible cattle tissues are: muscle, 0.84 ppm; kidney, 2.5 ppm; and fat, 3.3 ppm. A tolerance refers to the concentration of marker residue in the target tissue selected to monitor for total drug residue in the target animal. A safe concentration is the total residue considered safe in edible tissue.
