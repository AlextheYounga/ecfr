##### § 556.113 Ceftiofur. #####

(a) *Acceptable daily intake and acceptable single-dose intake* - (1) *Acceptable daily intake (ADI).* The ADI for total residues of ceftiofur is 30 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day.

(2) *Acceptable single-dose intake (ASDI).* The ASDI total residues of ceftiofur is 0.830 milligrams per kilogram of body weight. The ASDI is the amount of total residues of ceftiofur that may safely be consumed in a single meal. The ASDI is used to derive the tolerance for residues of desfuroylceftiofur at the injection site.

(b) *Tolerances* - (1) *Poultry, and sheep.* A tolerance for residues of ceftiofur in edible tissue is not required.

(2) *Swine.* The tolerances for desfuroylceftiofur (marker residue) are:

(i) *Kidney (target tissue).* 0.25 parts per million (ppm).

(ii)*Liver.* 3 ppm.

(iii) *Muscle.* 2 ppm.

(3) *Cattle.* The tolerances for desfuroylceftiofur (marker residue) are:

(i) *Kidney (target tissue).* 0.4 ppm.

(ii) *Liver.* 2 ppm.

(iii)*Muscle.* 1 ppm.

(iv) *Milk.* 0.1 ppm.
