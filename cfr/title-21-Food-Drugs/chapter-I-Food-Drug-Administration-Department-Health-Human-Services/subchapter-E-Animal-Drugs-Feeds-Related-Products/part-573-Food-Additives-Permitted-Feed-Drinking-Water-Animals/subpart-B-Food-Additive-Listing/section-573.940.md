The food additive silicon dioxide may be safely used in animal feed in accordance with the following conditions:

(a) The food additive is manufactured by vapor phase hydrolysis or by other means whereby the particle size is such as to accomplish the intended effect.

(b) It is used or intended for use in feed components as an anticaking agent, and/or grinding aid, as follows:

|                Feed component                 |Limitations (percent)|
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|        BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene)         |          2          |
|Methionine hydroxy analog and its calcium salts|          1          |
|         Piperazine, piperazine salts          |         0.8         |
