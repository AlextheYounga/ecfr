##### § 573.940 Silicon dioxide. #####

The food additive silicon dioxide may be safely used in animal feed in accordance with the following conditions:

(a) The food additive is manufactured by vapor phase hydrolysis or by other means whereby the particle size is such as to accomplish the intended effect.

(b) It is used or intended for use in feed components as an anticaking agent, and/or grinding aid, as follows:

|                Feed component                 |Limitations (percent)|
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
|        BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene)         |          2          |
|Methionine hydroxy analog and its calcium salts|          1          |
|         Piperazine, piperazine salts          |         0.8         |
|               Sodium propionate               |          1          |
|                     Urea                      |          1          |
|                   Vitamins                    |          3          |

(c) It is used in feed as an anticaking agent in an amount not to exceed that reasonably required to accomplish its intended effect and in no case in an amount to exceed 2 percent by weight of the finished feed.

(d) It is used or intended for use in feed components, as a carrier as follows:

|Feed component|Limitations  <br/>(percent)|
|--------------|---------------------------|
|   Flavors    |            50             |

(e) To ensure safe use of the additive, silicon dioxide is to be used in an amount not to exceed that reasonably required to accomplish its intended effect, and silicon dioxide from all sources cannot exceed 2 percent by weight of the complete feed.
