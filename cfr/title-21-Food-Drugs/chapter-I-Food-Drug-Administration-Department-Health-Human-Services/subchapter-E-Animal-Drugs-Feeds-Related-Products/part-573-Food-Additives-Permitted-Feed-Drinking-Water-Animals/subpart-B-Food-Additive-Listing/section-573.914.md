(2) Calcium salts:

|                                      Components                                      |           Amount            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Calcium salts of mixed 5-carbon acids (as identified in paragraph (a) of this section)|      58 to 72 percent.      |
|                           Calcium salt of isobutyric acid                            |      26 to 34 percent.      |
|                                  Calcium hydroxide                                   |     3 percent maximum.      |
|                                        Water                                         |     14 percent maximum.     |

|                              Heavy metals such as lead                               |10 parts per million maximum.|

(c) *Use.* The additive is used or intended for use as a source of energy in dairy cattle feed.

(d) *Labeling.* The label and labeling of the additive in any feed, feed supplement, feed concentrate, feed premix, or liquid feed supplement prepared therefrom shall bear, in addition to other information required by the act, the following:

(1) The name of the additive.

(2) Adequate directions for use, including statements expressing maximum use levels. For ammonium salts of volatile fatty acids, the statements: “Not to exceed 160 grams per head per day thoroughly mixed in dairy cattle feed as a source of energy.” For calcium salts of volatile fatty acids, the statement: “Not to exceed 135 grams per head per day thoroughly mixed in dairy cattle feed as a source of energy.”
