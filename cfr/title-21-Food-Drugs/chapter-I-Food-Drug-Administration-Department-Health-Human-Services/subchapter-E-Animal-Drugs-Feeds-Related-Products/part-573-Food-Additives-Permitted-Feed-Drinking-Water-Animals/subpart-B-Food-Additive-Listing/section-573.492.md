##### ยง 573.492 Gamma-linolenic acid safflower oil. #####

The food additive gamma-linolenic acid (all-*cis*-6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid) (GLA) safflower oil contains an omega-6 fatty acid that may be safely used in animal food in accordance with the following conditions:

(a) The additive GLA safflower oil is produced in the oil obtained from whole seeds or partially dehulled seeds or both obtained from a *Carthamus tinctorius* L. safflower Centennial variety genetically engineered to express the delta-6-desaturase gene from *Saprolegnia diclina* Humphrey. The 453 amino acid, delta-6-desaturase enzyme converts the fatty acid linoleic acid to GLA during seed development. This GLA safflower oil may be safely used in complete dry adult maintenance dog food as a source of GLA and other omega-6 fatty acids in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(1) The GLA safflower oil obtained from the seeds of the genetically engineered safflower Centennial variety may be blended with oil obtained from seeds of non-engineered oleic acid safflower varieties in order to meet the specifications required for the additive or the blend in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(2) The additive or a safflower oil blend containing the additive for use in animal food meets the following specifications:

(i) Crude fat content of the GLA safflower oil or its blend is not less than 99.5 percent.

(ii) GLA content is between 400 and 450 milligrams (mg) GLA per gram of the GLA safflower oil or its blend.

(iii) Total content of stearidonic acid and *cis, cis*-6,9-octadecadienoic acid in the GLA safflower oil or its blend must not exceed a total of 0.3 percent.

(3) Addition of GLA safflower oil, or its blend, to complete dry adult maintenance dog food must meet the following:

(i) Addition of the oil or its blend cannot provide more than 36 mg GLA per kilogram body weight of the dog per day in more than 86 mg of the GLA safflower oil or its blend. This maximum addition rate of the GLA safflower oil, or its blend, is 0.3 percent of a complete dry adult maintenance dog food containing 3,600 kilocalories of metabolizable energy per kilogram of food as-fed.

(ii) Adjustments must be made for dog food formulas of different caloric density and/or that are fed to specific weights, breeds, or dogs of different activity levels to meet the requirements of this paragraph.

(b) To assure safe use of the additive, in addition to other information required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the label and labeling of the additive shall bear the following:

(1) The name, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) safflower oil.

(2) A guarantee for the minimum content of gamma-linolenic acid.

(3) Adequate directions for use such that the finished animal food complies with the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
