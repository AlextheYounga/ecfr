(B) Reports of adverse drug experiences in the literature must be noted in the periodic drug experience report. A bibliography of pertinent references must be included with the report. Upon FDA's request, the applicant must provide a full text copy of these publications.

(C) Reports of previously not reported adverse drug experiences that occur in postapproval studies must be reported separately from other experiences in the periodic drug experience report and clearly marked or highlighted.

(v) *Summary report of increased frequency of adverse drug experience.* The applicant must periodically review the incidence of reports of adverse drug experiences to determine if there has been an increased frequency of serious (expected and unexpected) adverse drug events. The applicant must evaluate the increased frequency of serious (expected or unexpected) adverse drug events at least as often as reporting of periodic drug experience reports. The applicant must report the increased frequency of serious (expected and unexpected) adverse drug events in the periodic drug experience report. Summaries of reports of increased frequency of adverse drug events must be submitted in narrative form. The summaries must state the time period on which the increased frequency is based, time period comparisons in determining increased frequency, references to any previously submitted Form FDA 1932, the method of analysis, and the interpretation of the results. The summaries must be submitted in a separate section within the periodic drug experience report.

(5) *Other reporting* - (i) *Special drug experience report.* Upon written request, FDA may require that the applicant submit a report required under ยง 514.80 at different times or more frequently than the timeframes stated in ยง 514.80.

(ii) *Advertisements and promotional labeling.* The applicant must submit at the time of initial dissemination one set of specimens of mailing pieces and other labeling for prescription and over-the-counter new animal drugs. For prescription new animal drugs, the applicant must also submit one set of specimens of any advertisement at the time of initial publication or broadcast. Mailing pieces and labeling designed to contain product samples must be complete except that product samples may be omitted. Each submission of promotional labeling or advertisements must be accompanied by a completed Form FDA 2301.

(A) The distributor's current product labeling.

(*1*) The distributor's labeling must be identical to that in the approved NADA/ANADA except for a different and suitable proprietary name (if used) and the name and address of the distributor. The name and address of the distributor must be preceded by an appropriate qualifying phrase as permitted by the regulations such as โmanufactured forโ or โdistributed by.โ

(*2*) Other labeling changes must be the subject of a supplemental NADA or ANADA as described under ยง 514.8.

(B) A signed statement by the distributor stating:

(*1*) The category of the distributor's operations (e.g., wholesale or retail),

(*2*) That the distributor will distribute the new animal drug only under the approved labeling,

(*3*) That the distributor will promote the product only for use under the conditions stated in the approved labeling,

(*4*) That the distributor will adhere to the records and reports requirements of this section, and

(*5*) That the distributor is regularly and lawfully engaged in the distribution or dispensing of prescription products if the product is a prescription new animal drug.

(c) *Multiple applications.* Whenever an applicant is required to submit a periodic drug experience report under the provisions of ยง 514.80(b)(4) with respect to more than one approved NADA or ANADA for preparations containing the same new animal drug so that the same information is required to be reported for more than one application, the applicant may elect to submit as a part of the report for one such application (the primary application) all the information common to such applications in lieu of reporting separately and repetitively on each. If the applicant elects to do this, the applicant must do the following:

(1) State when a report applies to multiple applications and identify all related applications for which the report is submitted by NADA or ANADA number.

(2) Ensure that the primary application contains a list of the NADA or ANADA numbers of all related applications.
