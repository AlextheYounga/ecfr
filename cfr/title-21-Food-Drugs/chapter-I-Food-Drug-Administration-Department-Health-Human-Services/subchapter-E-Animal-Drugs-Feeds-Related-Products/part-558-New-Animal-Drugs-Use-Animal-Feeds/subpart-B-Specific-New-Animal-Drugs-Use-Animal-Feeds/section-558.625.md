(c) *Related tolerances.* See § 556.746 of this chapter.

(d) *Special considerations.* (1) Federal law restricts medicated feed containing this veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian. See § 558.6 for additional requirements.

(2) The expiration date of VFDs for tylosin medicated feeds must not exceed 6 months from the date of issuance. VFDs for tylosin shall not be refilled.

(3) Type C medicated feeds for cattle may be manufactured from tylosin liquid Type B medicated feeds which have a pH between 4.5 and 6.0 and which bear appropriate mixing directions as follows:

(i) For liquid feeds stored in recirculating tank systems: Recirculate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 minutes, moving not less than 1 percent of the tank contents per minute from the bottom of the tank to the top. Recirculate daily as described even when not used.

(ii) For liquid feeds stored in mechanical, air, or other agitation-type tank systems: Agitate immediately prior to use for not less than 10 minutes, creating a turbulence at the bottom of the tank that is visible at the top. Agitate daily as described even when not used.

(4) Tylosin liquid Type B medicated feeds must bear an expiration date of 31 days after the date of manufacture.

(5) Do not use tylosin liquid Type B medicated feeds in any liquid feed containing sodium metabisulfite or in any finished feed (supplement, concentrate, or complete feed) containing in excess of 2 percent bentonite.

No additional improvement in feed efficiency has been shown from feeding monensin at levels greater than 30 g/ton (360 mg monensin/head/day). A decrease in dry matter intake may be noticed in some animals receiving lubabegron. Lubabegron has not been approved for use in breeding animals because safety and effectiveness have not been evaluated in these animals. Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing lubabegron and monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal. Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in toxic reactions. Feeding undiluted or mixing errors resulting in high concentrations of monensin has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats. Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use. Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding directions, as reduced average daily gains may result. If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin overdosing. A withdrawal period has not been established for this product for preruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.
