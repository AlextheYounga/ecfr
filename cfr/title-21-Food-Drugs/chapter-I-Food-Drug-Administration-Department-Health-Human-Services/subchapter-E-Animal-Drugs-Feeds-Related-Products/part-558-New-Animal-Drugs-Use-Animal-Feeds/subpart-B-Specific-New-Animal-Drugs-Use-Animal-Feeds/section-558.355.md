(5) All Type A medicated articles containing monensin shall bear the following warning statement: When mixing and handling monensin Type A medicated articles, use protective clothing, impervious gloves, and a dust mask. Operators should wash thoroughly with soap and water after handling. If accidental eye contact occurs, immediately rinse thoroughly with water.

(6) All formulations containing monensin shall bear the following caution statement: Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal.

(7) Type A medicated articles containing monensin intended for use in cattle and goats shall bear, in addition to the caution statement in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the following statements:

(i) Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in toxic reactions.

(ii) Feeding undiluted or mixing errors resulting in high concentrations of monensin has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats.

(iii) Must be thoroughly mixed in feeds before use.

(iv) Do not feed undiluted.

(v) Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding directions, as reduced average daily gains may result.

(vi) Do not feed to lactating goats.

(vii) If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin overdosing (see paragraphs (d)(10)(i) and (d)(10)(ii) of this section).

(viii) A withdrawal period has not been established for this product in pre-ruminating calves. Do not use in calves to be processed for veal.

(ix) You may notice the following: Reduced voluntary feed intake in dairy cows fed monensin. This reduction increases with higher doses of monensin fed. Rule out monensin as the cause of reduced feed intake before attributing to other causes such as illness, feed management, or the environment. Reduced milk fat percentage in dairy cows fed monensin. This reduction increases with higher doses of monensin fed. Increased incidence of cystic ovaries and metritis in dairy cows fed monensin. Reduced conception rates, increased services per animal, and extended days open and corresponding calving intervals in dairy cows fed monensin. Have a comprehensive and ongoing nutritional, reproductive, and herd health program in place when feeding monensin to dairy cows.

(x) Inadequate mixing (recirculation or agitation) of monensin liquid Type B or Type C medicated feeds has resulted in increased monensin concentration which has been fatal to cattle and could be fatal to goats.

(8) Type A medicated articles containing monensin intended for use in chickens, turkeys, and quail shall bear the following statements:

See special labeling considerations in paragraph (d) of this section.

(*2*) An approved physically stable monensin liquid feed will not be subject to the requirements for mixing directions defined in paragraph (d)12) of this section. A manufacturer may secure approval of a physically stable liquid feed by:

(*i*) Either filing an NADA for the product or by establishing a master file containing data to support the stability of its product;

(*ii*) Authorizing the agency to reference and rely upon the data in the master file to support approval of a supplemental NADA to establish physical stability; and

(*iii*) Requesting No. 058198 in § 510.600(c) of this chapter to file a supplemental NADA to provide for the use of its monensin Type A article in the manufacture of the liquid feed specified in the appropriate master file. If the data demonstrate the stability of the liquid feed described in the master file, the agency will approve the supplemental NADA. The approval will provide a basis for the individual liquid feed manufacturer to manufacture the liquid medicated feed under a medicated feed mill license described in the master file. A manufacturer who seeks to market a physically unstable monensin liquid feed with mixing directions different from the standard established in paragraph (d)(12) of this section may also follow this procedure.

(*a*) *Sponsor.* See No. 067949 in § 510.600(c) of this chapter.

(*b*) *Conditions of use* - (*1*) *Indications for use.* For increased rate of weight gain in pasture cattle (slaughter, stocker, feeder, and dairy and beef replacement heifers).

(*2*) *Limitations.* Provide 80 to 200 milligrams of monensin (0.2 to 0.5 pounds of block) per head per day, at least 1 block per 5 head of cattle. Feed blocks continuously. Do not feed salt or minerals containing salt. The effectiveness of this block in cull cows and bulls has not been established. See paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section.

(*2*) *Limitations.* Provide 40 to 200 milligrams of monensin (0.25 to 1.13 pounds or 4 to 18 ounces of block) per head per day, at least 1 block per 4 head of cattle. Do not allow cattle access to salt or mineral while being fed this product. Ingestion by cattle of monensin at levels of 600 milligrams per head per day and higher has been fatal. The effectiveness of this block in cull cows and bulls has not been established. See paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section.

(iv) *Amount.* 400 milligrams per pound of block (0.088 percent).

(*a*) *Sponsor.* See No. 051267 in § 510.600(c) of this chapter.

(*2*) *Limitations.* Provide 50 to 200 milligrams of monensin (2 to 8 ounces of block) per head per day, at least 1 block per 5 head of cattle. Feed blocks continuously. Do not feed salt or mineral supplements in addition to the blocks. Ingestion by cattle of monensin at levels of 600 milligrams per head per day and higher has been fatal. The effectiveness of this block in cull cows and bulls has not been established. See paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section.
