(2) The expiration date of VFDs for chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine medicated feeds must not exceed 6 months from the date of issuance. VFDs for chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine shall not be refilled.

(3) Labeling of Type A medicated articles and Type B and Type C medicated feeds containing lincomycin shall bear the following:

(i) “CAUTION: Do not allow rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, horses, or ruminants access to feeds containing lincomycin. Ingestion by these species may result in severe gastrointestinal effects.”

(ii) [Reserved]

(4) Labeling of medicated feeds containing lincomycin intended for use in swine shall bear the following:

(i) “CAUTION: Occasionally, swine fed lincomycin may within the first 2 days after the onset of treatment develop diarrhea and/or swelling of the anus. On rare occasions, some pigs may show reddening of the skin and irritable behavior. These conditions have been self-correcting within 5 to 8 days without discontinuing the lincomycin treatment.”
