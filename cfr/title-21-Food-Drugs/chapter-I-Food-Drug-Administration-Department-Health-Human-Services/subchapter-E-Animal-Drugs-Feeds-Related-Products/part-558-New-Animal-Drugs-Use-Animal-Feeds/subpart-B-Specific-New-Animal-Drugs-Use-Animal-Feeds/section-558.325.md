(4) Labeling of medicated feeds containing lincomycin intended for use in swine shall bear the following:

(i) “CAUTION: Occasionally, swine fed lincomycin may within the first 2 days after the onset of treatment develop diarrhea and/or swelling of the anus. On rare occasions, some pigs may show reddening of the skin and irritable behavior. These conditions have been self-correcting within 5 to 8 days without discontinuing the lincomycin treatment.”
