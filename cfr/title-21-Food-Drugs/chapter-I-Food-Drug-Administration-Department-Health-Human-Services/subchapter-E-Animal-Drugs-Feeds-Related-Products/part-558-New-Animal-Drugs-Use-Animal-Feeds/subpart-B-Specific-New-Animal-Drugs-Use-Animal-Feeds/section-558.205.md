Not for use in hens producing eggs for human food. Because diclazuril is effective against E. maxima later in its life cycle, subclinical intestinal lesions may be present for a short time after infection. Diclazuril was shown in studies to reduce lesion scores and improve performance and health of birds challenged with E. maxima.                                              |058198 |
