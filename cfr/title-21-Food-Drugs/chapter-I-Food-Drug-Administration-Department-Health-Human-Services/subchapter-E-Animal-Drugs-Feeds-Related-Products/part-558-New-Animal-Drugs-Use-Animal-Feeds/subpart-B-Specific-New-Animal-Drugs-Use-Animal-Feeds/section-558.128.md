Feed for not more than 5 days, then continue feeding monensin Type C medicated feed alone. For use in dry feeds only. Not for use in liquid feed supplements. Do not allow horses or other equines access to feed containing monensin. Ingestion of monensin by horses has been fatal. Monensin medicated cattle and goat feeds are safe for use in cattle and goats only. Consumption by unapproved species may result in toxic reactions. Do not exceed the levels of monensin recommended in the feeding directions, as reduced average daily gains may result. If feed refusals containing monensin are fed to other groups of cattle, the concentration of monensin in the refusals and amount of refusals fed should be taken into consideration to prevent monensin overdosing.
