No increased benefit in rate of weight gain has been shown when narasin concentrations in the diet are greater than 13.6 g/ton. Effectiveness has not been demonstrated when fed for durations less than 4 weeks. Do not allow adult turkeys, horses, or other equines access to narasin formulations. Ingestion of narasin by these species has been fatal. Not approved for use in breeding animals because safety and effectiveness have not been evaluated in these animals. Swine being fed with narasin should not have access to feeds containing pleuromutilins (e.g., tiamulin) as adverse reactions may occur. If signs of toxicity occur, discontinue use|058198 |
