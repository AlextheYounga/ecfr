|(i) 0.91 (1 part per million (ppm))|                                        |Broiler chickens: For the prevention of coccidiosis caused by Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix, E. acervulina, E. brunetti, E. mitis (mivati), and E. maxima. Because diclazuril is effective against E. maxima later in its life cycle, subclinical intestinal lesions may be present for a short time after infection. Diclazuril was shown in studies to reduce lesion scores and improve performance and health of birds challenged with E. maxima.|      Feed continuously.
