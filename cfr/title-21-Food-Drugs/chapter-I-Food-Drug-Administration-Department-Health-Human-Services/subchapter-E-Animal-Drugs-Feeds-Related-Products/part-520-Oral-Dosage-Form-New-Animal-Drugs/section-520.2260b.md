(ii) *Indications for use.* For beef and nonlactating dairy cattle for the treatment of diseases caused by sulfamethazine-sensitive organisms as follows: bacterial pneumonia and bovine respiratory disease complex (shipping fever complex) caused by *Pasteurella* spp., colibacillosis (bacterial scours) caused by *E. coli,* necrotic pododermatitis (foot rot) and calf diphtheria caused by *Fusobacterium necrophorum,* and acute mastitis and acute metritis caused by *Streptococcus* spp.)

(iii) *Limitations.* After 72 hours, all animals should be reexamined for persistence of observable disease signs. If signs are present, consult a veterinarian. It is strongly recommended that a second dose be given to provide for an additional 72 hours of therapy, particularly in more severe cases. The dosage schedule should be used at each 72-hour interval. Animals should not receive more than 2 doses because of the possibility of incurring residue violations. This drug, like all sulfonamides, may cause toxic reactions and irreparable injury unless administered with adequate and continuous supervision; *follow dosages carefully.* Fluid intake must be adequate at all times throughout the 3-day therapy, Do not use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older. Use of sulfamethazine in this class of cattle may cause milk residues. Do not treat animals within 12 days of slaughter.

(iii) *Limitations.* For use in ruminating replacement calves only; 72 hours after dosing all animals should be reexamined for persistence of disease signs; if signs are present, consult a veterinarian; do not slaughter animals for food for at least 12 days after the last dose; this product has not been shown to be effective for nonruminating calves; exceeding two consecutive doses may cause violative tissue residue to remain beyond the withdrawal time; do not use in calves under 1 month of age or calves being fed an all milk diet.
