##### § 73.1 Diluents in color additive mixtures for food use exempt from certification. #####

The following substances may be safely used as diluents in color additive mixtures for food use exempt from certification, subject to the condition that each straight color in the mixture has been exempted from certification or, if not so exempted, is from a batch that has previously been certified and has not changed in composition since certification. If a specification for a particular diluent is not set forth in this part 73, the material shall be of a purity consistent with its intended use.

(a) *General use.* (1) Substances that are generally recognized as safe under the conditions set forth in section 201(s) of the act.

(2) Substances meeting the definitions and specifications set forth under subchapter B of this chapter, and which are used only as prescribed by such regulations.

(3) The following:
