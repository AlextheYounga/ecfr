(c) *Uses and restrictions.* Alumina (dried aluminum hydroxide) may be safely used in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice to color drugs generally.

(d) *Labeling requirements.* The label of the color additive and of any mixtures prepared therefrom intended solely or in part for coloring purposes shall conform to the requirements of § 70.25 of this chapter.
