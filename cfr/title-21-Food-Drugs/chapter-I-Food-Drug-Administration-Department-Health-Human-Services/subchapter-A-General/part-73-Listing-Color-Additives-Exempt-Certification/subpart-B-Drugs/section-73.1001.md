Such listing of diluents is not to be construed as superseding any of the other requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with respect to drugs, including new drugs. If a definition and specification for a particular diluent is not set forth in this subpart, the material shall be of a purity consistent with its intended use.
