(a) *Identity.* The color additive manganese violet is a violet pigment obtained by reacting phosphoric acid, ammonium dihydrogen orthophosphate, and manganese dioxide at temperatures above 450 °F. The pigment is a manganese ammonium pyrophosphate complex having the approximate formula: Mn(III)NH4P2O7.

(b) *Specifications.* Manganese violet shall conform to the following specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named, to the extent that such other impurities may be avoided by good manufacturing practice:

Ash (at 600 °C), not less than 81 percent.Volatile matter at 135 °C for 3 hours, not more than 1 percent.Water soluble substances, not more than 6 percent.pH of filtrate of 10 grams color additive (shaken occasionally for 2 hours with 100 milliliters of freshly boiled distilled water), not more than 4.7 and not less than 2.5.Lead (as Pb), not more than 20 parts per million.Arsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million.Mercury (as Hg), not more than 1 part per million.Total color, based on Mn content in “as is” sample, not less than 93 percent.

(c) *Uses and restrictions.* Manganese violet is safe for use in coloring cosmetics generally, including cosmetics applied to the area of the eye, in amounts consistent with good manufacturing practice.

(d) *Labeling.* The color additive and any mixture prepared therefrom intended solely or in part for coloring purposes shall bear, in addition to any information required by law, labeling in accordance with § 70.25 of this chapter.

(e) *Exemption from certification.* Certification of this color additive is not necessary for the protection of the public health, and therefore batches thereof are exempt from certification pursuant to section 721(c) of the act.
