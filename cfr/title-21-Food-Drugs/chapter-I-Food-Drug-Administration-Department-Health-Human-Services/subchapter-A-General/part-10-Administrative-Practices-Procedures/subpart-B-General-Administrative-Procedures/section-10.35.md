(2) A statute requires that the matter be stayed.

(3) A court orders that the matter be stayed.

(e) The Commissioner shall promptly review a petition for stay of action. The Commissioner may grant or deny a petition, in whole or in part; and may grant such other relief or take such other action as is warranted by the petition.
