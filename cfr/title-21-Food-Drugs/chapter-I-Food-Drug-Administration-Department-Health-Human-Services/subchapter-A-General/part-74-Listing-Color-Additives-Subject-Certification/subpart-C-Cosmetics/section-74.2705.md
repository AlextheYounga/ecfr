##### § 74.2705 FD&C Yellow No. 5. #####

(a) *Identity.* The color additive FD&C Yellow No. 5 is principally the trisodium salt of 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-(1-4-sulfophenyl)-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-1*H*-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid (CAS Reg. No. 1934-21-0). To manufacture the additive, 4-aminobenzenesulfonic acid is diazotized using hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite. The diazo compound is coupled with 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1*H*-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid or with the methyl ester, the ethyl ester, or a salt of this carboxylic acid. The resulting dye is purified and isolated as the sodium salt.

(b) *Specifications.* (1) FD&C Yellow No. 5 shall conform to the following specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named to the extent that such other impurities may be avoided by good manufacturing practice:

Sum of volatile matter at 135 °C (275 °F) and chlorides and sulfates (calculated as sodium salts), not more than 13 percent.Water-insoluble matter, not more than 0.2 percent.4,4′-[4,5-Dihydro-5-oxo-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)hydrazono]-1*H*-pyrazol-1,3-diyl]bis[benzenesulfonic acid], trisodium salt, not more than 1 percent.4-[(4′,5-Disulfo[1,1′-biphenyl]-2-yl)hydrazono]-4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1*H*-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, tetrasodium salt, not more than 1 percent.Ethyl or methyl 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)hydrazono]-1*H*-pyrazole-3-carboxylate, disodium salt, not more than 1 percent.Sum of 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-phenyl-4-[(4-sulfophenyl)azo]-1*H*-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, disodium salt, and 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-4-(phenylazo)-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1*H*-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, disodium salt, not more than 0.5 percent.4-Aminobenzenesulfonic acid, sodium salt, not more than 0.2 percent.4,5-Dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1*H*-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid, disodium salt, not more than 0.2 percent.Ethyl or methyl 4,5-dihydro-5-oxo-1-(4-sulfophenyl)-1*H*-pyrazole-3-carboxylate, sodium salt, not more than 0.1 percent.4,4′-(1-Triazene-1,3-diyl)bis[benzenesulfonic acid], disodium salt, not more than 0.05 percent.4-Aminoazobenzene, not more than 75 parts per billion.4-Aminobiphenyl, not more than 5 parts per billion.Aniline, not more than 100 parts per billion.Azobenzene, not more than 40 parts per billion.Benzidine, not more than 1 part per billion.1,3-Diphenyltriazene, not more than 40 parts per billion.Lead (as Pb), not more than 10 parts per million.Arsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million.Mercury (as Hg), not more than 1 part per million.Total color, not less than 87 percent.

(2) FD&C Yellow No. 5 Aluminum Lake shall be prepared in accordance with the requirements of § 82.51 of this chapter.

(c) *Uses and restrictions.* (1) FD&C Yellow No. 5 may be safely used for coloring cosmetics generally, including cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye, in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practice.

(2) FD&C Yellow No. 5 Aluminum Lake may be safely used for coloring cosmetics intended for use in the area of the eye, subject to the restrictions on use of color additives in § 70.5(b) and (c) of this chapter, in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practice.

(d) *Labeling.* The label of the color additive shall conform to the requirements of § 70.25 of this chapter.

(e) *Certification.* All batches of FD&C Yellow No. 5 shall be certified in accordance with regulations in part 80 of this chapter.
