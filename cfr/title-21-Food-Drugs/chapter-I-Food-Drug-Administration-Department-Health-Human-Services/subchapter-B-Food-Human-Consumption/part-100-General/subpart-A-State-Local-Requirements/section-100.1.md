##### § 100.1 Petitions requesting exemption from preemption for State or local requirements. #####

(a) *Scope and purpose.* (1) This subpart applies to the submission and consideration of petitions under section 403A(b) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), by a State or a political subdivision of a State, requesting exemption of a State requirement from preemption under section 403A(a) of the act.

(2) Section 403A(b) of the act provides that where a State requirement has been preempted under section 403A(a) of the act, the State may petition the agency for an exemption. The agency may grant the exemption, under such conditions as it may prescribe by regulation, if the agency finds that the State requirement will not cause any food to be in violation of any applicable requirement under Federal law, will not unduly burden interstate commerce, and is designed to address a particular need for information that is not met by the preemptive Federal requirement.

(b) *Definitions.* (1) *Act* means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321 *et seq.*).

(2) *Agency* means the Food and Drug Administration.

(3) *Commissioner* means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.

(4) *State* means a State as defined in section 201(a)(1) of the act (which includes a territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico) or any political subdivision of a State having authority to issue food standards and food labeling regulations having force of law.

(5) *State requirement* means any statute, standard, regulation, or other requirement that is issued by a State.

(c) *Prerequisites for petitions for exemption from preemption.* The Food and Drug Administration will consider a petition for exemption from preemption on its merits only if the petition demonstrates that:

(1) The State requirement was enacted or was issued as a final rule by an authorized official of the State and is in effect or would be in effect but for the provisions of section 403A of the act.

(2) The State requirement is subject to preemption under section 403A(a) of the act because of a statutory provision listed in that section or because of a Federal standard or other Federal regulation that is in effect, or that has been published as a final rule with a designated effective date, and that was issued under the authority of a statutory provision listed in that section. For the purposes of this subpart, all petitions seeking exemption from preemption under section 403A(a)(3) through (a)(5) of the act submitted before May 8, 1992, will be considered timely even though the applicable statutory provisions or regulations are not yet in effect.

(3) The petitioner is an official of a State having authority to act for, or on behalf of, the Government in applying for an exemption of State requirements from preemption.

(4) The State requirement is subject to preemption under section 403A(a) of the act because it is not identical to the requirement of the preemptive Federal statutory provision or regulation including a standard of identity, quality, and fill. “Not identical to” does not refer to the specific words in the requirement but instead means that the State requirement directly or indirectly imposes obligations or contains provisions concerning the composition or labeling of food, or concerning a food container, that:

(i) Are not imposed by or contained in the applicable provision (including any implementing regulation) of section 401 or 403 of the act; or

(ii) Differ from those specifically imposed by or contained in the applicable provision (including any implementing regulation) of section 401 or 403 of the act.

(d) *Form of petition.* (1) All information included in the petition should meet the general requirements of § 10.20(c) of this chapter.

(2) An original and one copy of the petition shall be submitted, or the petitioner may submit an original and a computer readable disk containing the petition. Contents of the disk should be in a standard format, such as ASCII format. (Petitioners interested in submitting a disk should contact the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition for details.)

(3) Petitions for exemption from preemption for a State requirement shall be submitted to the Division of Dockets Management in the following form:
