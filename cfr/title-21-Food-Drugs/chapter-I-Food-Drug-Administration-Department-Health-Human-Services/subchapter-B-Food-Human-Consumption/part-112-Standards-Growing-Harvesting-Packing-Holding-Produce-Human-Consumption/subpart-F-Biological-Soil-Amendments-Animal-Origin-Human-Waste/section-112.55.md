##### § 112.55 What microbial standards apply to the treatment processes in § 112.54? #####

The following microbial standards apply to the treatment processes in § 112.54 as set forth in that section.

(a) For *L. monocytogenes,**Salmonella* species, and *E. coli* O157:H7, the relevant standards in the table in this paragraph (a); or

|For the microorganism—|                                                              The microbial standard is—                                                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| (1) L. monocytogenes | Not detected using a method that can detect one colony forming unit (CFU) per 5 gram (or milliliter, if liquid is being sampled) analytical portion. |
|(2) Salmonella species|Not detected using a method that can detect three most probable numbers (MPN) per 4 grams (or milliliter, if liquid is being sampled) of total solids.|
| (3) E. coli O157:H7  |            Not detected using a method that can detect 0.3 MPN per 1 gram (or milliliter, if liquid is being sampled) analytical portion.            |

(b) *Salmonella* species are not detected using a method that can detect three MPN *Salmonella* species per 4 grams (or milliliter, if liquid is being sampled) of total solids; and less than 1,000 MPN fecal coliforms per gram (or milliliter, if liquid is being sampled) of total solids.
