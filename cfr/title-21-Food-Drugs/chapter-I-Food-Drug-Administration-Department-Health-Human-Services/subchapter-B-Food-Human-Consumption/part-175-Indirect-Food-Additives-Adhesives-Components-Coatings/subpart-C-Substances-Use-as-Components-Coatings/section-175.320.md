##### ยง 175.320 Resinous and polymeric coatings for polyolefin films. #####

Resinous and polymeric coatings may be safely used as the food-contact surface of articles intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(a) The coating is applied as a continuous film over one or both sides of a base film produced from one or more of the basic olefin polymers complying with ยง 177.1520 of this chapter. The base polyolefin film may contain optional adjuvant substances permitted for use in polyolefin film by applicable regulations in parts 170 through 189 of this chapter.

(b) The coatings are formulated from optional substances which are:

(1) Substances generally recognized as safe for use in or on food.

(2) Substances the use of which is permitted under applicable regulations in parts 170 through 189 of this chapter, by prior sanctions, or approvals.

(3) Substances identified in this paragraph (b)(3) and subject to such limitations as are provided:
