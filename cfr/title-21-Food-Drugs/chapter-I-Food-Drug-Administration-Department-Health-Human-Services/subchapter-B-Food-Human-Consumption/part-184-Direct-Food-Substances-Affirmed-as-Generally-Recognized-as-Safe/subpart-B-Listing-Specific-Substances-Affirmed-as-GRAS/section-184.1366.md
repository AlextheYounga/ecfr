##### § 184.1366 Hydrogen peroxide. #####

(a) Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, CAS Reg. No. 7722-84-1) is also referred to as hydrogen dioxide. It is made by the electrolytic oxidation of sulfuric acid or a sulfate to persulfuric acid or a persulfuric acid salt with subsequent hydrolysis and distillation of the hydrogen peroxide formed; by decomposition of barium peroxide with sulfuric or phosphoric acid; by hydrogen reduction of 2-ethylanthraquinone, followed by oxidation with air, to regenerate the quinone and produce hydrogen peroxide; or by electrical discharge through a mixture of hydrogen, oxygen, and water vapor.

(b) The ingredient meets the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex, 3d ed. (1981), pp. 146-147,1 which is incorporated by reference.
