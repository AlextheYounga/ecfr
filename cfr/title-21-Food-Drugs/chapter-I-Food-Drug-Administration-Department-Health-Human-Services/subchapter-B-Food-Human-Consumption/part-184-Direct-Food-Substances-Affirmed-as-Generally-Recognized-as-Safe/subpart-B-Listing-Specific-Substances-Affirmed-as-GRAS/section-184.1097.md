Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 72907, Nov. 16, 2020.

(a) Tannic acid (CAS Reg. No. 1401-55-4), or hydrolyzable gallotannin, is a complex polyphenolic organic structure that yields gallic acid and either glucose or quinic acid as hydrolysis products. It is a yellowish-white to light brown substance in the form of an amorphous, bulky powder, glistening scales, or spongy masses. It is also ordorless, or has a faint characteristic odor, and has an astringent taste. Tannic acid is obtained by solvent extraction of nutgalls or excrescences that form on the young twigs of *Quercus infectoria Oliver* and related species of *Quercus.* Tannic acid is also obtained by solvent extraction of the seed pods of Tara (*Caesalpinia spinosa*) or the nutgalls of various sumac species, including *Rhus semialata, R. coriaria, R. galabra,* and *R. typhia.*
