##### § 184.1472 Menhaden oil. #####

(a) *Menhaden oil.* (1) Menhaden oil is prepared from fish of the genus *Brevoortia,* commonly known as menhaden, by cooking and pressing. The resulting crude oil is then refined using the following steps: Storage (winterization), degumming (optional), neutralization, bleaching, and deodorization. Winterization may separate the oil and produce a solid fraction.

(i) *Color and state.* Yellow liquid to white solid.

(ii) *Odor.* Odorless to slightly fishy.

(iii) *Saponification value.* Between 180 and 200 as determined by the American Oil Chemists' Society Official Method Cd 3-25 - “Saponification Value” (reapproved 1989), which is incorporated by reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
