##### § 177.1900 Urea-formaldehyde resins in molded articles. #####

Urea-formaldehyde resins may be safely used as the food-contact surface of molded articles intended for use in contact with food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(a) For the purpose of this section, urea-formaldehyde resins are those produced when 1 mole of urea is made to react with not more than 2 moles of formaldehyde in water solution.

(b) The resins may be mixed with refined wood pulp and the mixture may contain other optional adjuvant substances which may include the following:

|        List of substances        |                 Limitations                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
|      Hexamethylenetetramine      |For use only as polymerization-control agent.|
|Tetrachlorophthalic acid anhydride|                     Do.                     |
|          Zinc stearate           |            For use as lubricant.            |

(c) The finished food-contact article, when extracted with the solvent or solvents characterizing the type of food and under the conditions of time and temperature characterizing the conditions of its intended use as determined from tables 1 and 2 of § 175.300(d) of this chapter, yields total extractives in each extracting solvent not to exceed 0.5 milligram per square inch of food-contact surface as determined by the methods described in § 175.300(e) of this chapter.

Note:

In testing the finished food-contact article, use a separate test sample for each required extracting solvent.
