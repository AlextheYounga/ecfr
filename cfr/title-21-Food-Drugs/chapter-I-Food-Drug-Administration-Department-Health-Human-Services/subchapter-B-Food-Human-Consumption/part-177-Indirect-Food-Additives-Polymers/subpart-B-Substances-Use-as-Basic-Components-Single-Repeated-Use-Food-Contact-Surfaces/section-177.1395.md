##### § 177.1395 Laminate structures for use at temperatures between 120 °F and 250 °F. #####

(a) The laminates identified in this section may be safely used at the specified temperatures. These articles are layered structures that are optionally bonded with adhesives. In these articles, the food-contact layer does not function as a barrier to migration of components from non-food-contact layers. The layers may be laminated, extruded, coextruded, or fused.

(b) Laminate structures may be manufactured from:

(1) Polymers and adjuvants complying with § 177.1390 of this chapter.

(2) Any polymeric resin listed in these regulations so long as the use of the resin in the structure complies with the conditions of use (food type and time/temperature) specified in the regulation for that resin.

(3) Optional adjuvant substances used in accordance with § 174.5 of this chapter.

(4) The following substances in non-food-contact layers only:
