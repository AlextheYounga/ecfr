(d) The analytical methods for determining whether olefin polymers conform to the specifications prescribed in this section are as follows, and are applicable to the basic polymer in film form not exceeding 4 mils in thickness. The film to be tested shall be cut into approximately 1-inch squares by any convenient method that avoids contamination by dust, dirt, or grease (Note: Do not touch samples with bare fingersโuse forceps to hold or transfer samples).

(1) *Density.* Density shall be determined by ASTM method D1505-68 (Reapproved 1979), โStandard Test Method for Density of Plastics by the Density-Gradient Technique,โ which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Dr., West Conshohocken, Philadelphia, PA 19428-2959, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: *http://www.archives.gov/federal\_register/code\_of\_federal\_regulations/ibr\_locations.html.*

(2) *Melting point or softening point*โ(i) *Melting point.* The melting point shall be determined by ASTM method D2117-82, โStandard Test Method for Melting Point of Semicrystalline Polymers by the Hot Stage Microscopy Method,โ which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(ii) *Softening point.* The softening point shall be determined by ASTM method E28-67 (Reapproved 1982), โStandard Test Method for Softening Point by Ring-and-Ball Apparatus,โ which is incorporated by reference. The availability of this incorporation by reference is given in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(3) *Maximum extractable fraction in n-hexane*โ(i) *Olefin copolymers described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, polypropylene, and poly(methylpentene).* A sample is refluxed in the solvent for 2 hours and filtered at the boiling point. The filtrate is evaporated and the total residue weighed as a measure of the solvent extractable fraction.

(*a*) *Apparatus.* (*1*) Erlenmeyer flasks, 250-milliliter, with ground joint.

(*2*) Condensers, Allihn, 400-millimeter jacket, with ground joint.

(*3*) Funnels, ribbed 75-millimeter diameter, stem cut to 40 millimeters.

(*4*) Funnels, Buchner type, with coarse-porosity fritted disc, 60-millimeter diameter.

(*5*) Bell jar for vacuum filtration into beaker.

(*b*) *Reagent. n-*Hexane, commercial grade, specific gravity 0.663-0.667 (20 ยฐC/20 ยฐC), boiling range 66 ยฐC-69 ยฐC, or equivalent.

(*c*) *Procedure.* Weigh 1 gram of sample accurately and place in a 250-milliliter Erlenmeyer flask containing two or three boiling stones. Add 100 milliliters of solvent, attach the flask to the condenser (use no grease), and reflux the mixture for 2 hours. Remove the flask from the heat, disconnect the condenser, and filter rapidly, while still hot, through a small wad of glass wool packed in a short-stem funnel into a tared 150-millimeter beaker. Rinse the flask and filter with two 10-milliliter portions of the hot solvent, and add the rinsings to the filtrate. Evaporate the filtrate on a stream bath with the aid of a stream of nitrogen. Dry the residue in a vacuum oven at 110 ยฐC for 2 hours, cool in a desiccator, and weigh to the nearest 0.0001 gram. Determine the blank on 120 milliliters of solvent evaporated in a tared 150-milliliter beaker. Correct the sample residue for this blank if significant. Calculation:

(ii) *Olefin copolymers described in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section and polyethylene.* A preweighed sample is extracted at 50 ยฐC for 2 hours and filtered. The filtrate is evaporated and the total residue weighed as a measure of the solvent extractable fraction. Alternatively, the sample is reweighed after the extraction period to give a measure of the solvent extractable fraction. The maximum *n*-hexane-extractable fraction may be determined by the methods set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(*a*) through (d)(3)(ii)(*i*) of this section.

(*a*) *Extraction apparatus.* Two-liter, straight-walled, Pyrex (or equivalent) resin kettles, fitted with three-hole ground-glass covers are most convenient for this purpose. The cover is fitted with a thermometer, a gas-tight stirrer driven by an air motor or explosion-proof electric motor, and a reflux condenser. The kettle is fitted with an electric heating mantle of appropriate size and shape, which is controlled by a variable-voltage transformer.

(*b*) *Evaporating apparatus.* Rapid evaporation of large volumes of solvent requires special precautions to prevent contamination by dust. This is facilitated by a special โgasโ cover consisting of an inverted flat Pyrex crystallizing dish of an appropriate size (190 millimeters ร 100 millimeters) to fit a 1-liter beaker. Through the center of the dish are sealed an inlet tube for preheated, oxygen-free nitrogen, and an outlet tube located 1 inch off center. Nitrogen is fed from the supply source through a coil of1/4-inch stainless steel tubing immersed in the same steam bath used to supply heat for solvent evaporation. All connections are made with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing.

(*c*) *Reagents*โ(*1) n-Hexane.* Spectrograde *n-*hexane.

(*2) Nitrogen.* High-purity dry nitrogen containing less than 10 parts per million of oxygen.

(*d*) *Procedure.* Transfer 2.5 grams (accurately weighed to nearest 0.001 gram) of the polymer to the resin kettle. Add 1 liter of solvent and clamp top in position. Start water flowing through jacket of the reflux condenser and apply air pressure to the stirring motor to produce vigorous agitation. Turn on heating jacket with transformer set at a predetermined voltage to bring the temperature of the contents to 50 ยฐC within 20-25 minutes. As the thermometer reading approaches 45 ยฐC-47 ยฐC, reduce the voltage to the predetermined setting that will just maintain the temperature at 50 ยฐC. Do not overshoot the prescribed temperature. Should this occur discard the test and start afresh. Exactly 2 hours after the solvent temperature has reached 50 ยฐC, disconnect the heater, remove the resin kettle from the heating jacket, and decant the solvent, while still warm, through a coarse filter paper placed on top of a fritted-glass funnel, collecting the filtrate in a tared, glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask of 1-liter capacity. Determine the weight of the filtrate recovered to the nearest gram. Recovery should be at least 90 percent of the original solvent. Losses due to evaporation during heating and filtering have been found not to exceed 10 percent. Transfer about half of the solvent filtrate to a 1-liter beaker placed on an opening in the steam bath and immediately cover with the special โgasโ cover, the inlet tube of which has been attached with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing to a source of high-purity nitrogen in series with a stainless steel heating coil immersed directly in the body of the steam bath. Maintain a positive flow of warm nitrogen gas throughout the evaporation of the solvent, adding the remainder of the filtrate from the Erlenmeyer flask as the evaporation proceeds. When the volume of the solvent has been reduced to about 50 milliliters, transfer the concentrated liquid to a previously tared weighing dish of suitable size. Wash the beaker twice with 20-30 milliliter portions of warm solvent, adding the washings to the weighing dish while continuing to evaporate the remainder of the solvent under the gas cover with its flow of warm nitrogen directed toward the center of the dish. In the event that an insoluble residue that cannot be removed with warm solvent remains in the beaker, it may be necessary to heat with a small amount of a higher boiling solvent such as benzene or toluene, transferring these washings to the weighing dish before final evaporation to dryness. Transfer the weighing dish with its residue to a vacuum desiccator, and allow it to remain overnight (at least 12 hours), after which the net weight of the dry residue is determined to the nearest 0.0001 gram. Correct the result for any solvent blank equivalent to the nonvolatile matter determined to be contained in the amount of solvents used in the test.

(*e*) *Extraction apparatus for alternate method.* Two-liter extraction vessel, such as a resin kettle or round bottom flask, fitted with an Allihn condenser (size C), a 45/50 male joint with a Teflon sleeve, and a Teflon coated stir bar. Water bath maintained at 49.5 ยฐC ยฑ0.5 ยฐC containing a submersible magnetic stirrer motor with power supply. Other suitable means of maintaining temperature control, such as electric heating mantles, may be used provided that the temperature range can be strictly maintained.

(*f*) *Sample basket (Optional).* A perforated stainless steel cylindrical basket that is approximately 1.5 inches in diameter, 1.6 inches high, and has perforations of 0.125 inches in diameter for 33 holes/in2, or 40 percent open area. The basket should pass freely through the 45/50 female joint of the extraction flask. A No. 6-32 stainless steel eye-bolt is attached to the lid for positioning the basket in the extraction vessel. The positioning rod, approximately 18 inches long and made from1/16 inch outside diameter 316 stainless steel welding rod or equivalent and hooked at both ends, is used to position the basket in the extraction apparatus.

(*g*) *Vacuum oven.* Capable of maintaining 80 ยฐC ยฑ5 ยฐC and a minimum of 635 millimeters of mercury pressure.

(*h*) *Reagents. n*-Hexane, reagent or spectrograde, aromatic free (less than 1 milligram per liter), minimum 85 percent *n*-hexane. This reagent may be reused until it contains a maximum of 1.5 grams polyolefin extractables or has been used for 12 determinations.

(*i*) *Procedure.* Assemble the extraction vessel, condenser, and magnetic stir bar. Add *n*-hexane (1 liter) to the extraction vessel and clamp the assembly into a water bath set at 49.5 ยฐC ยฑ0.5 ยฐC. Start the water flowing through the jacket of the reflux condenser. Adjust the air flow through the stirring motor to give a smooth and uniform stir rate. Allow the *n*-hexane to preheat for 1 hour to bring the temperature to 49.5 ยฐCยฑ0.5 ยฐC. Temperature is a critical factor in this analysis and it must not vary more than 1 ยฐC. If the temperature exceeds these limits, the test must be discontinued and restarted. Blown, compression molded, or extrusion cast films can be tested. Ideally, the film should be prepared by the same process as will be used with the production resin. Using gloves and metal tweezers to avoid sample contamination, cut about 2.7 grams of the prepared film (4 mils or less in thickness) into about 1-inch squares using clean sharp scissors. Proceed with Option 1 or 2.

*Option 1.* Using tweezers and noting the number of film pieces, transfer 2.5 grams (accurately weighed to 0.1 milligram) of polymer to the extraction vessel. Extract the film sample for 2 hours. Allow the vessel to cool and filter the contents through a fritted porcelain funnel. Wash the film pieces with fresh *n*-hexane, aspirate to dryness, and transfer, using tweezers, to a beaker. Recount the film pieces to verify that none were lost during the transfer. Place the beaker in the vacuum oven for 2 hours at 80 ยฐC ยฑ5 ยฐC. After 2 hours, remove and place in a desiccator to cool to room temperature (about 1 hour). After cooling, reweigh the film pieces to the nearest 0.1 milligram. Calculate the percent hexane-extractables content from the weight loss of the original sample. Multiply the result by 0.935 and compare with extraction limits in paragraph (c) of this section. Repeat the above procedure for successive samples.

*Option 2.* Transfer 2.5ยฑ0.05 grams of the prepared 1-inch film sections into a tared sample basket and accurately weigh to the nearest 0.1 milligram. Carefully raise the condenser until the hook on the positioning rod is above the neck of the 2-liter extraction vessel. The basket should be totally below the level of *n*-hexane solvent. Extract the sample resin film for 2 hours and then raise the basket above the solvent level to drain momentarily. Remove the basket and rinse the contents by immersing several times in fresh *n*-hexane. Allow the basket to dry between rinsings. Remove the excess solvent by briefly blowing the basket with a stream of nitrogen or dry air. Place the basket in the vacuum oven for 2 hours at 80 ยฐC ยฑ5 ยฐC. After 2 hours, remove and place in a desiccator to cool to room temperature (about 1 hour). After cooling, reweigh the basket to the nearest 0.1 milligram. Calculate the percent hexane extractables content from the weight loss of the original sample. Multiply the result by 0.935 and compare with extraction limits in paragraph (c) of this section. Repeat the above procedure for successive samples. The same solvent charge should remain clear and can be used for at least 12 determinations. Applications of solvent reuse should be confirmed for each resin type before use.

(4) *Maximum soluble fraction in xylene*โ(i) *Olefin copolymers described in paragraph* (*a*)(*3*)(*ii*) *of this section, polypropylene, and poly*(*methylpen-tene*). A sample is dissolved completely in xylene by heating and stirring in a bottle with little free space. The solution is allowed to cool without stirring, whereupon the insoluble portion precipitates and is filtered off; the total solids content of the filtrate is then determined as a measure of the soluble fraction.

(*a*) *Apparatus.* (*1*) Pyrex (or equivalent) reagent bottle, 125-milliliter, glass-stoppered.

(*2*) Heating mantle of size for 150-milliliter beaker (or suitable aluminum block to fit the 125-milliter bottle described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(*a*)(*1*) of this section.

(*3*) Magnetic stirrer for use under the heating mantle (combination magnetic stirrer and hotplate may be used if aluminum block is used in place of heating mantle).

(*4*) Variable-voltage transformer, 7.5 amperes.

(*5*) Tetrafluoroethylene-resin-coated stirring bar, 1-inch long.

(*6*) Constant temperature water bath maintained at 25 ยฐCยฑ0.5 ยฐC.

(*7*) *Aluminum* dishes, 18 millimeters ร 60 millimeters, disposable.

(*8*) Funnel, Buchner type, with coarse-porosity fritted disc, 30-60 millimeter diameter.

(*b*) *Reagent.* Xylene with antioxidant. Dissolve 0.020 gram of phenyl-ฮฒ- naphthylamine in 1 liter of industrial grade xylene having specific gravity 0.856-0.867 (20 ยฐC/20 ยฐC) and boiling range 123 ยฐC-160 ยฐC.

(*c*) *Procedure.* Weigh 1 to 2 grams of sample to the nearest 0.001 gram and place in a 125-milliliter Pyrex reagent bottle containing a 1-inch long tetrafluoroethylene-resin-coated stirring bar. Add 100 milliliters of solvent, set the stopper in lightly, and place the bottle in the heating mantle or aluminum block maintained at a temperature of 120 ยฐC, and stir with a magnetic stirrer until the sample is completely dissolved. Remove the bottle from the heat and allow it to cool 1 hour in the air, without stirring. Then place the bottle in a water bath maintained at 25 ยฐC ยฑ0.5 ยฐC, and allow to stand 1 hour without stirring. Next, remove the bottle from the water bath, shake, and pour part of the contents into the coarse-porosity fritted-glass funnel. Apply suction, and draw 30-40 milliliters of filtrate through, adding more slurry to the funnel, and catching the filtrate in a large test tube. (If the slurry is hard to filter, add 10 grams of diatomaceous earth filter aid to the bottle and shake vigorously just prior to the filtration.) Pipet a suitable aliquot (preferably 20 milliliters) of the filtrate into a tared aluminum disposable dish. Place the dish on a steam bath covered with a fresh sheet of aluminum foil and invert a short-stemmed 4-inch funnel over the dish. Pass nitrogen (heated if desired) down through the funnel at a rate sufficient to just ripple the surface of the solvent. When the liquid has evaporated, place the dish in a vacuum oven at 140 ยฐC and less than 50 millimeters mercury pressure for 2 hours. Cool in a desiccator and weigh. (Note: If the residue value seems high, redry in the vacuum oven for one-half hour to ensure complete removal of all xylene solvent.) Calculation:

(ii) *Olefin copolymers described in paragraph* (*a*)(*3*)(*i*) *of this section and polyethylene.* A sample is extracted in xylene at reflux temperature for 2 hours and filtered. The filtrate is evaporated and the total residue weighed as a measure of soluble fraction.

(*a*) *Apparatus*โ(*1*) *Extraction apparatus.* Two-liter, straight-walled Pyrex (or equivalent) resin kettles, fitted with ground-glass covers, are most convenient for this purpose. The cover is equipped with a thermometer and an efficient reflux condenser. The kettle is fitted with an electric heating mantle of appropriate size and shape which is controlled by a variable-voltage transformer.

(*2*) *Constant temperature water bath.* It must be large enough to permit immersion of the extraction kettle and set to maintain 25 ยฐC ยฑ0.1 ยฐC.

(*3*) *Evaporating apparatus.* Gas cover consisting of a flat Pyrex crystallizing dish (190 millimeters ร 100 millimeters) inverted to fit over a 1-liter beaker with 8-millimeter gas inlet tube sealed through center and an outlet tube 1 inch off center. The beaker with gas cover is inserted in an electric heating mantle equipped with a variable-voltage transformer. The outlet tube is attached to an efficient condenser mounted on a receiving flask for solvent recovery and having an outlet for connection to an aspirator pump. The heating mantle (with the beaker) is mounted on a magnetic stirring device. An infrared heat lamp is mounted vertically 3-4 inches above the gas cover to prevent condensation of the solvent inside the cover. Make all connections with flexible tetrafluoroethylene tubing.

(*b*) *Reagents*โ(*1*) *Xylene.* American Chemical Society reagent grade that has been redistilled through a fractionating column to reduce the nonvolatile residue.

(*2*) *Nitrogen.* High-purity dry nitrogen containing less than 104 parts per million oxygen.

(*c*) *Procedure.* Transfer 5 grams ยฑ0.001 gram of sample to the resin kettle, add 1,000 milliliters (840 grams) of xylene, and clamp top in position after inserting a piece of glass rod to prevent bumping during reflux. Start water flowing through the jacket of the reflux condenser and apply full voltage (115 volts) to the heating mantle. When the xylene starts to boil, reduce the voltage to a level just sufficient to maintain reflux. After refluxing for at least 2 hours, disconnect the power source to the mantle, remove the kettle, and allow to cool in air until the temperature of the contents drops to 50 ยฐC, after which the kettle may be rapidly cooled to 25 ยฐC-30 ยฐC by immersing in a cold water bath. Transfer the kettle to a constant temperature bath set to maintain 25 ยฐC ยฑ0.1 ยฐC, and allow to equilibrate for a least 1 hour (may be left overnight if convenient). Break up any precipitated polymers that may have formed, and decant the xylene solution successively through a fast filter paper and then through a fritted-glass filter into a tared 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask, collecting only the first 450 millilitersโ500 milliliters of filtrate (any attempt to collect more of the xylene solution usually results in clogging the filter and risking losses). Reweigh the Erlenmeyer flask and calculate the weight of the filtrate obtained to the nearest 0.1 gram. Transfer the filtrate, quantitatively, from the Erlenmeyer flask to the 1-liter beaker, insert the beaker in its heating mantle, add a glass-coated magnetic stirring bar, and mount the gas cover in place, connecting the inlet tube to the nitrogen source and the outlet to the condenser of the receiving flask. Start a flow of nitrogen (2 to 3 liters per minute) into the gas cover and connect an aspirator to the receiver using a free-flow rate equivalent to 6-7 liters of air per minute. With the infrared lamp on, adjust the voltage to the heating mantle to give a distillation rate of 12-13 milliliters per minute when the magnetic stirrer is revolving just fast enough to promote good boiling. When the volume of solvent in the beaker has been reduced to 30-50 milliliters, transfer the concentrated extractive to a suitable weighing dish that has been previously tared (dry). Rinse the beaker twice with 10-20 milliliter portions of fresh xylene, adding the rinsings to the weighing dish. Evaporate the remainder of the xylene on an electric hotplate set at low heat under the gas cover with a stream of nitrogen directed toward the center of the dish. Avoid any charring of the residue. Transfer the weighing dish to a vacuum desiccator at room temperature and allow to remain under reduced pressure for at least 12 hours (overnight), after which determine the net weight of the residue to the nearest 0.0001 gram. Correct the result for nonvolatile solvent blank obtained by evaporating the equivalent amount of xylene under identical conditions. Calculate the weight of residue originally present in the total weight of solvent (840 grams), using the appropriate factor based on the weight of filtrate evaporated.
