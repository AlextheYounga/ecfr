##### § 177.1200 Cellophane. #####

Cellophane may be safely used for packaging food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(a) Cellophane consists of a base sheet made from regenerated cellulose to which have been added certain optional substances of a grade of purity suitable for use in food packaging as constituents of the base sheet or as coatings applied to impart desired technological properties.

(b) Subject to any limitations prescribed in this part, the optional substances used in the base sheet and coating may include:

(1) Substances generally recognized as safe in food.

(2) Substances for which prior approval or sanctions permit their use in cellophane, under conditions specified in such sanctions and substances listed in § 181.22 of this chapter.

(3) Substances that by any regulation promulgated under section 409 of the act may be safely used as components of cellophane.

(4) Substances named in this section and further identified as required.
