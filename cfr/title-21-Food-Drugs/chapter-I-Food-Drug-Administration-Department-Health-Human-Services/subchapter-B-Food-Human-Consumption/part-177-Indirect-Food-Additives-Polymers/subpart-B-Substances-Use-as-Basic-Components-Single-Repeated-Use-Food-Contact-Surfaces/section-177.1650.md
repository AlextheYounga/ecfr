##### § 177.1650 Polysulfide polymer-polyepoxy resins. #####

Polysulfide polymer-polyepoxy res- ins may be safely used as the food-contact surface of articles intended for packaging, transporting, holding, or otherwise contacting dry food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(a) Polysulfide polymer-polyepoxy resins are the reaction products of liquid polysulfide polymers and polyfunctional epoxide resins, cured with the aid of tri(dimethylaminomethyl) phenol, to which have been added certain optional substances to impart desired technological properties to the resins. Subject to any limitations prescribed in this section, the optional substances may include:

(1) Substances generally recognized as safe in food and food packaging.

(2) Substances the use of which is permitted under applicable regulations in this part, prior sanctions, or approvals.

(3) Substances named in this subparagraph and further identified as required:
