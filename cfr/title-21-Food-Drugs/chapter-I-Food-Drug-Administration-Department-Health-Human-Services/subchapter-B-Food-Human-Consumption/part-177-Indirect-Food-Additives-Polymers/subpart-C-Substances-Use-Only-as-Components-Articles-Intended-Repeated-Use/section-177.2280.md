##### § 177.2280 4,4′-Isopropylidenediphenolepichlorohydrin thermosetting epoxy resins. #####

4,4′-Isopropylidenediphenol-epichlo-rohydrin thermosetting epoxy resins may be safely used as articles or components of articles intended for repeated use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(a) The basic thermosetting epoxy resin is made by reacting 4,4′-isopropylidenediphenol with epichlorohydrin.

(b) The resin may contain one or more of the following optional substances provided the quantity used does not exceed that reasonably required to accomplish the intended effect:
