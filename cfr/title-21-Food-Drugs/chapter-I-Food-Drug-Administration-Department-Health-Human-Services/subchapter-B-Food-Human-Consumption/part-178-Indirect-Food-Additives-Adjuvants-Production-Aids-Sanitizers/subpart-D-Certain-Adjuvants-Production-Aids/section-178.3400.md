##### § 178.3400 Emulsifiers and/or surface-active agents. #####

The substances listed in paragraph (c) of this section may be safely used as emulsifiers and/or surface-active agents in the manufacture of articles or components of articles intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, subject to the provisions of this section.

(a) The quantity used shall not exceed the amount reasonably required to accomplish the intended technical effect; and the quantity that may become a component of food as a result of such use shall not be intended to, nor in fact, accomplish any physical or technical effect in the food itself.

(b) The use as an emulsifier and/or surface-active agent in any substance or article that is the subject of a regulation in parts 174, 175, 176, 177, 178 and § 179.45 of this chapter conforms with any specifications and limitations prescribed by such regulation for the finished form of the substance or article.
