##### § 178.3650 Odorless light petroleum hydrocarbons. #####

Odorless light petroleum hydrocarbons may be safely used, as a component of nonfood articles intended for use in contact with food, in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(a) The additive is a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons derived from petroleum or synthesized from petroleum gases. The additive is chiefly paraffinic, isoparaffinic, or naphthenic in nature.

(b) The additive meets the following specifications:

(1) Odor is faint and not kerosenic.

(2) Initial boiling point is 300 °F minimum.

(3) Final boiling point is 650 °F maximum.

(4) Ultraviolet absorbance limits determined by method specified in § 178.3620(b)(1)(ii), as follows:

|Wavelength (Mµ)|Maximum absorbance per centimeter optical pathlength|
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|  280 to 289   |                        4.0                         |
|  290 to 299   |                        3.3                         |
|  300 to 329   |                        2.3                         |
