##### § 178.3520 Industrial starch-modified. #####

Industrial starch-modified may be safely used as a component of articles intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding food, subject to the provisions of this section.

(a) Industrial starch-modified is identified as follows:

(1) A food starch-modified or starch or any combination thereof that has been modified by treatment with one of the reactants hereinafter specified, in an amount reasonably required to achieve the desired functional effect but in no event in excess of any limitation prescribed, with or without subsequent treatment as authorized in § 172.892 of this chapter.
