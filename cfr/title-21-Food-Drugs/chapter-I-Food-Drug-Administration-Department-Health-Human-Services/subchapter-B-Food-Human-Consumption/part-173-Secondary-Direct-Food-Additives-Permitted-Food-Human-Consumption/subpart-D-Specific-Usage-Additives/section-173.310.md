##### § 173.310 Boiler water additives. #####

Boiler water additives may be safely used in the preparation of steam that will contact food, under the following conditions:

(a) The amount of additive is not in excess of that required for its functional purpose, and the amount of steam in contact with food does not exceed that required to produce the intended effect in or on the food.

(b) The compounds are prepared from substances identified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, and are subject to the limitations, if any, prescribed:
