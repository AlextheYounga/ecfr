##### § 179.39 Ultraviolet radiation for the processing and treatment of food. #####

Ultraviolet radiation for the processing and treatment of food may be safely used under the following conditions:

(a) The radiation sources consist of low pressure mercury lamps emitting 90 percent of the emission at a wavelength of 253.7 nanometers (2,537 Angstroms).

(b) The ultraviolet radiation is used or intended for use as follows:
