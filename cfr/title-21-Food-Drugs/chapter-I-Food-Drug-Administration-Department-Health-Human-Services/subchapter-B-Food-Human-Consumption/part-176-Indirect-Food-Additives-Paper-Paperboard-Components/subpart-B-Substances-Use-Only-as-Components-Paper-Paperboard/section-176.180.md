##### § 176.180 Components of paper and paperboard in contact with dry food. #####

The substances listed in this section may be safely used as components of the uncoated or coated food-contact surface of paper and paperboard intended for use in producing, manufacturing, packing, processing, preparing, treating, packaging, transporting, or holding dry food of the type identified in § 176.170(c), table 1, under Type VIII, subject to the provisions of this section.

(a) The substances are used in amounts not to exceed that required to accomplish their intended physical or technical effect, and are so used as to accomplish no effect in food other than that ordinarily accomplished by packaging.

(b) The substances permitted to be used include the following:

(1) Substances that by § 176.170 and other applicable regulations in parts 170 through 189 of this chapter may be safely used as components of the uncoated or coated food-contact surface of paper and paperboard, subject to the provisions of such regulation.

|        Polyamide-ethyleneimine-epichlorohydrin resin is prepared by reacting equimolar amounts of adipic acid and three amines (21 mole percent of 1,2-ethanediamine, 51 mole percent of N-(2-aminoethyl)-1,3-propanediamine, and 28 mole percent of N, N′-1,2-ethanediylbis(1,3-propanediamine)) to form a basic polyamidoamine which is modified by reaction with ethyleneimine (5.5:1.0 ethyleneimine:polyamidoamine). The modified polyamidoamine is reacted with a crosslinking agent made by condensing approximately 34 ethylene glycol units with (chloromethyl)oxirane, followed by pH adjustment with formic acid or sulfuric acid to provide a finished product as a formate (CAS Reg. No. 114133-44-7) or a sulfate (CAS Reg. No. 167678-43-5), having a weight-average molecular weight of 1,300,000 and a number-average molecular weight of 16,000.        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
