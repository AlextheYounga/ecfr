The food additive, quaternary ammonium chloride combination, may be safely used in food in accordance with the following conditions:

(a) The additive contains the following compounds: *n-*dodecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (CAS Reg. No. 139-07-1); *n-*dodecyl dimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chloride (CAS Reg. No. 27479-28-3); *n-*hexadecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (CAS Reg. No. 122-18-9); *n-*octadecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (CAS Reg. No. 122-19-0); *n-*tetradecyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride (CAS Reg. No. 139-08-2); *n-*tetradecyl dimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chloride (CAS Reg. No. 27479-29-4).

(b) The additive meets the following specifications: pH (5 percent active solution) 7.0-8.0; total amines, maximum 1 percent as combined free amines and amine hydrochlorides.

(c) The additive is used as an antimicrobial agent, as defined in ยง 170.3(o)(2) of this chapter, in raw sugar cane juice. It is added prior to clarification when further processing of the sugar cane juice must be delayed.
