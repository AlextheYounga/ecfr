##### § 172.710 Adjuvants for pesticide use dilutions. #####

The following surfactants and related adjuvants may be safely added to pesticide use dilutions by a grower or applicant prior to application to the growing crop:

*n-*Alkyl (C8-C18) amine acetate, where the alkyl groups (C8-C18) are derived from coconut oil, as a surfactant in emulsifier blends at levels not in excess of 5 percent by weight of the emulsifier blends that are added to herbicides for application to corn and sorghum.

Di*-n-*alkyl (C8-C18) dimethyl ammonium chloride, where the alkyl groups (C8-C18) are derived from coconut oil, as surfactants in emulsifier blends at levels not in excess of 5 percent by weight of emulsifier blends that are added to herbicides for application to corn or sorghum.

Diethanolamide condensate based on a mixture of saturated and unsaturated soybean oil fatty acids (C16-C18) as a surfactant in emulsifier blends that are added to the herbicide atrazine for application to corn.

Diethanolamide condensate based on stripped coconut fatty acids (C10 C18) as a surfactant in emulsifier blends that are added to the herbicide atrazine for application to corn.

α-(*p-*Dodecylphenyl)*-omega-*hydroxypoly (oxyethylene) produced by the condensation of 1 mole of dodecylphenol (dodecyl group is a proplyene tetramer isomer) with an average of 4-14 or 30-70 moles of ethylene oxide; if a blend of products is used, the average number of moles of ethylene oxide reacted to produce any product that is a component of the blend shall be in the range of 4-14 or 30-70.

Ethylene dichloride.

Polyglyceryl phthalate ester of coconut oil fatty acids.

α-[*p-*(1,1,3,3-Tetramethylbutyl) phenyl]*-omega-*hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) produced by the condensation of 1 mole of *p-*(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenol with an average of 4-14 or 30-70 moles of ethylene oxide; if a blend of products is used, the average number of moles of ethylene oxide reacted to produce any product that is a component of the blend shall be in the range of 4-14 or 30-70.

α-[*p-*(1,1,3,3-Tetramethylbutyl) phenyl]-*omega-*hydroxypoly(oxyethylene) produced by the condensation of 1 mole of *p-*(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl) phenol with 1 mole of ethylene oxide.

Sodium acrylate and acrylamide copolymer with a minimum average molecular weight of 10,000,000 in which 30 percent of the polymer is comprised of acrylate units and 70 percent acrylamide units, for use as a drift control agent in herbicide formulations applied to crops at a level not to exceed 0.5 ounces of the additive per acre.
