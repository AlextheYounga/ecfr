##### § 172.882 Synthetic isoparaffinic petroleum hydrocarbons. #####

Synthetic isoparaffinic petroleum hydrocarbons may be safely used in food, in accordance with the following conditions:

(a) They are produced by synthesis from petroleum gases and consist of a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons meeting the following specifications:

Boiling point 93-260 °C as determined by ASTM method D86-82, “Standard Method for Distillation of Petroleum Products,” which is incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Dr., West Conshohocken, Philadelphia, PA 19428-2959, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: *http://www.archives.gov/federal\_register/code\_of\_federal\_regulations/ibr\_locations.html.*

Ultraviolet absorbance:

260-319 millimicrons—1.5 maximum.

320-329 millimicrons—0.08 maximum.

330-350 millimicrons—0.05 maximum.

Nonvolatile residual: 0.002 gram per 100 milliliters maximum.

Synthetic isoparaffinic petroleum hydrocarbons containing antioxidants shall meet the specified ultraviolet absorbance limits after correction for any absorbance due to the antioxidants. The ultraviolet absorbance shall be determined by the procedure described for application of mineral oil, disregarding the last sentence of the procedure, under “Specifications” on page 66 of the “Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” Volume 45 (February 1962), which is incorporated by reference. Copies are available from the Office of Food Additive Safety (HFS-200), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, 240-402-1200, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: *http://www.archives.gov/federal\_register/code\_of\_federal\_regulations/ibr\_locations.html.* For hydrocarbons boiling below 250 °F, the nonvolatile residue shall be determined by ASTM method D1353-78, “Standard Test Method for Nonvolatile Matter in Volatile Solvents for Use in Paint, Varnish, Lacquer, and Related Products;” for those boiling above 121 °C, ASTM method D381-80, “Standard Test Method for Existent Gum in Fuels by Jet Evaporation” shall be used. These methods are incorporated by reference. Copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing Materials, 100 Barr Harbor Dr., West Conshohocken, Philadelphia, PA 19428-2959, or may be examined at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).

(b) Isoparaffinic petroleum hydrocarbons may contain antioxidants authorized for use in food in an amount not to exceed that reasonably required to accomplish the intended technical effect nor to exceed any prescribed limitations.

(c) Synthetic isoparaffinic petroleum hydrocarbons are used or intended for use as follows:
