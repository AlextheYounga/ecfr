(b) The additive meets the following specifications:

(1) Odor is faint and not kerosenic.

(2) Initial boiling point is 300 °F minimum.

(3) Final boiling point is 650 °F maximum.

(4) Ultraviolet absorbance limits determined by method specified in § 178.3620(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter, as follows:
