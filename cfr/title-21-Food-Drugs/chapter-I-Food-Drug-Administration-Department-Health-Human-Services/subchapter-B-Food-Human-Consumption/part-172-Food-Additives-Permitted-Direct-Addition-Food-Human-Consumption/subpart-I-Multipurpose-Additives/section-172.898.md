(c) The viable microbial content of the finished ingredient is:

(1) Less than 10,000 organisms/gram by aerobic plate count.

(2) Less than 10 yeasts and molds/gram.

(3) Negative for *Salmonella, E. coli,* coagulase positive *Staphylococci, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum,* or any other recognized microbial pathogen or any harmful microbial toxin.
