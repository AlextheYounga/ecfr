##### § 172.834 Ethoxylated mono- and diglycerides. #####

The food additive ethoxylated mono-and diglycerides (polyoxyethylene (20) mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids) (polyglycerate 60) may be safely used in food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:

(a) The food additive is manufactured by:

(1) Glycerolysis of edible fats primarily composed of stearic, palmitic, and myristic acids; or

(2) Direct esterification of glycerol with a mixture of primarily stearic, palmitic, and myristic acids;

to yield a product with less than 0.3 acid number and less than 0.2 percent water, which is then reacted with ethylene oxide.

(b) The additive meets the following specifications:

Saponification number, 65-75.Acid number, 0-2.Hydroxyl number, 65-80.Oxyethylene content, 60.5-65.0 percent.

(c) The additive is used or intended for use in the following foods when standards of identity established under section 401 of the Act do not preclude such use:
