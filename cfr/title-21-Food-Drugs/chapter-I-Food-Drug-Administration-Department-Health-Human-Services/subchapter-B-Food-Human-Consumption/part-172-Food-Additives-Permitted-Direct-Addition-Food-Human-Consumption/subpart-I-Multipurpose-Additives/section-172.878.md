##### § 172.878 White mineral oil. #####

White mineral oil may be safely used in food in accordance with the following conditions:

(a) White mineral oil is a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons, essentially paraffinic and naphthenic in nature obtained from petroleum. It is refined to meet the following specifications:

(1) It meets the test requirements of the United States Pharmacopeia XX (1980) for readily carbonizable substances (page 532).

(2) It meets the test requirements of U.S.P. XVII for sulfur compounds (page 400).

(3) It meets the specifications prescribed in the “Journal of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,” Volume 45, page 66 (1962), which is incorporated by reference, after correction of the ultraviolet absorbance for any absorbance due to added antioxidants. Copies of the material incorporated by reference are available from the Office of Food Additive Safety (HFS-200), Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5001 Campus Dr., College Park, MD 20740, 240-402-1200, or available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
