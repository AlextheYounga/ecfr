##### § 201.316 Drugs with thyroid hormone activity for human use; required warning. #####

(a) Drugs with thyroid hormone activity have been promoted for, and continue to be dispensed and prescribed for, use in the treatment of obesity, although their safety and effectiveness for that use have never been established.

(b) Drugs for human use with thyroid hormone activity are misbranded within the meaning of section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act unless their labeling bears the following boxed warning at the beginning of the “Warnings” section:

Drugs with thyroid hormone activity, alone or together with other therapeutic agents, have been used for the treatment of obesity. In euthyroid patients, doses within the range of daily hormonal requirements are ineffective for weight reduction. Larger doses may produce serious or even life-threatening manifestations of toxicity, particularly when given in association with sympathomimetic amines such as those used for their anorectic effects.
