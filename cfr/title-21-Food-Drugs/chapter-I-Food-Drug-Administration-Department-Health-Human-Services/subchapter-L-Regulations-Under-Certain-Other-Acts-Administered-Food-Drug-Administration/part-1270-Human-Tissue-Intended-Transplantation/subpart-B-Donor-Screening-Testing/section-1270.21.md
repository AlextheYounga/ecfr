##### ยง 1270.21 Determination of donor suitability for human tissue intended for transplantation. #####

(a) Donor specimens shall be tested for the following communicable viruses, using Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed donor screening tests in accordance with manufacturers' instructions:

(1) Human immunodeficiency virus, Type 1 (e.g., FDA licensed screening test for anti-HIV-1);

(2) Human immunodeficiency virus, Type 2 (e.g., FDA licensed screening test for anti-HIV-2);

(3) Hepatitis B (e.g., FDA licensed screening test for HBsAg); and

(4) Hepatitis C (e.g., FDA licensed screening test for anti-HCV).

(b) In the case of a neonate, the mother's specimen is acceptable for testing.

(c) Such infectious disease testing shall be performed by a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA).

(d) Human tissue shall be accompanied by records indicating that the donor's specimen has been tested and found negative using FDA licensed screening tests for HIV-1, HIV-2, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. FDA licensed screening tests labeled for cadaveric specimens must be used when available.

(e) Human tissue for transplantation shall be accompanied by a summary of records or copies of the original records of the donor's relevant medical records as defined in ยง 1270.3(t) which documents freedom from risk factors for and clinical evidence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV infection. There shall be a responsible person designated and identified in the original record and summary of records as having made the determination that the human tissue is suitable for transplantation.

(f) Determination by the responsible person that a donor of human tissue intended for transplantation is suitable shall include ascertainment of the donor's identity, and accurately recorded relevant medical records (as defined in ยง 1270.3(t)) which documents freedom from risk factors for and clinical evidence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV infection.

(g) For corneal tissue procured under legislative consent where a donor medical history screening interview has not occurred, a physical assessment of the donor is required and other available information shall be reviewed. The corneal tissue shall be accompanied by the summary of records documenting that the corneal tissue was determined to be suitable for transplantation in the absence of the donor medical history interview. Corneal tissue procured under legislative consent shall be documented as such in the summary of records.

(h) Human tissue shall be determined to be not suitable for transplantation if from:

(1) A donor whose specimen has tested repeatedly reactive on a screening test for HIV, hepatitis B, or hepatitis C;

(2) A donor where blood loss is known or suspected to have occurred and transfusion/infusion of more than 2,000 milliliters (mL) of blood (i.e., whole blood, reconstituted blood, or red blood cells), or colloids within 48 hours; or more than 2,000 mL of crystalloids within 1 hour; or any combination thereof prior to the collection of a blood specimen from the tissue donor for testing, unless:

(i) A pretransfusion or preinfusion blood specimen from the tissue donor is available for infectious disease testing; or

(ii) An algorithm is utilized that evaluates the volumes administered in the 48 hours prior to collecting the blood specimen from the tissue donor to ensure that there has not been plasma dilution sufficient to affect test results; or

(3) A donor who is 12 years of age or less and has been transfused or infused at all, unless:

(i) A pretransfusion or preinfusion blood specimen from the tissue donor is available for infectious disease testing; or

(ii) An algorithm is utilized that evaluates the volumes administered in the 48 hours prior to collecting the blood specimen from the tissue donor to ensure that there has not been plasma dilution sufficient to affect test results.
