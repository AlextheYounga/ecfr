(j) *Human tissue*, for the purpose of this part means any tissue derived from a human body and recovered before May 25, 2005, which:

(1) Is intended for transplantation to another human for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any condition or disease;

(2) Is recovered, processed, stored, or distributed by methods that do not change tissue function or characteristics;

(3) Is not currently regulated as a human drug, biological product, or medical device;

(p) *Processing* means any activity performed on tissue, other than tissue recovery, including preparation, preservation for storage, and/or removal from storage to assure the quality and/or sterility of human tissue. Processing includes steps to inactivate and remove adventitious agents.

(q) *Quarantine* means the identification of human tissue as not suitable for transplantation, including human tissue that has not yet been characterized as being suitable for transplantation. Quarantine includes the storage of such tissue in an area clearly identified for such use, or other procedures, such as automated designation, for prevention of release of such tissue for transplantation.

(r) *Reconstituted blood* means the extracorporeal resuspension of a blood unit labeled as “Red Blood Cells” by the addition of colloids and/or crystalloids to produce a hematocrit in the normal range.

(s) *Recovery* means the obtaining from a donor of tissue that is intended for use in human transplantation.

(t) *Relevant medical records* means a collection of documents including a donor medical history interview, a physical assessment of the donor, laboratory test results, medical records, existing coroner and autopsy reports, or information obtained from any source or records which may pertain to donor suitability regarding high risk behaviors, clinical signs and symptoms for HIV and hepatitis, and treatments related to medical conditions suggestive of such risk.

(u) *Responsible person* means a person who is authorized to perform designated functions for which he or she is trained and qualified.

(v) *Storage* means holding tissue.

(w) *Summary of records* means a condensed version of the required testing and screening records that contains the identity of the testing laboratory, the listing and interpretation of all required infectious disease tests, and a listing of the documents reviewed as part of the relevant medical records, and the name of the person or establishment determining the suitability of the human tissue for transplantation.

(x) *Vascularized* means containing the original blood vessels which are intended to carry blood after transplantation.
