(a) Sections 513(e) and (f), 514(b), 515(b), and 520(l) of the act provide for reclassification of a device and prescribe the procedures to be followed to effect reclassification. The purposes of subpart C are to:

(1) Set forth the requirements as to form and content of petitions for reclassification;

(2) Describe the circumstances in which each of the five statutory reclassification provisions applies; and

(3) Explain the procedure for reclassification prescribed in the five statutory reclassification provisions.

(b) The criteria for determining the proper class for a device are set forth in ยง 860.3(c). The reclassification of any device within a generic type of device causes the reclassification of all substantially equivalent devices within that generic type. Accordingly, a petition for the reclassification of a specific device will be considered a petition for reclassification of all substantially equivalent devices within the same generic type.

(c) Any interested person may submit a petition for reclassification under section 513(e), 514(b), or 515(b). A manufacturer or importer may submit a petition for reclassification under section 513(f) or 520(l). The Commissioner may initiate the reclassification of a device classified into class III under sections 513(f) and 520(l) of the act.
