##### § 1107.19 Comparison information. #####

The SE Report must include a comparison of the characteristics of the new tobacco product to the predicate tobacco product. Where test data is submitted, the testing information must include the test protocols, quantitative acceptance criteria, and test results (including means and variances, data sets, and a summary of the results). Comparison testing must be conducted on a sufficient sample size and on test samples that reflect the finished tobacco product composition and design. The SE report must state whether the same test methods were used for the new tobacco product and the predicate product, and if the methods differed, an explanation as to how the results of the different test methods can be compared. The SE report must identify national and international standards used to test the new and predicate tobacco products and explain any deviations from the standard, or state that no standards were used for the testing. The SE report must include the following:

(a) *Comparison of product design.* The SE Report must include a description of the product designs of the new and predicate tobacco products and an identification of any differences. The SE Report must include, in a tabular format, a side-by-side comparison of each design parameter of the new and predicate tobacco products. The target specification and upper and lower range limits must be provided for each design parameter. Test data (including test protocols, quantitative acceptance criteria, data sets (*i.e.,* measured values), and a summary of the results) must be provided for the new and predicate tobacco products when the target specification or range limits of the new tobacco product differ from the predicate tobacco product. For tobacco cut size or particle size, when target specifications and range limits are not available, the following alternative information may be submitted in place of this information: A description of the tobacco cutting process (including a complete description of the milling, cutting, and sifting process; the control parameters of the miller or cutter; and any sift specifications) or the measured particle size distribution for the new and predicate tobacco products.

(1) *Cigarettes.* For cigarettes, the required design parameter information to be provided for each predicate and new tobacco product is as follows:

(f) *Shelf life and stability information.* With the exception of SE Reports for roll-your-own tobacco products and cigarettes that are not HTPs, SE Reports for all tobacco products must contain information on the stability of the new and predicate tobacco products over the shelf life, including the following information:

(1) The length of the shelf life, a description of how shelf life is determined, and a description of how shelf life is indicated on the tobacco product, if applicable. If a tobacco product does not have a defined shelf life, state as such;

(2) Any known or expected impacts of the differences between the new and predicate products on the product stability. If no impact is known or expected, state that;

(3) Stability data assessed at the beginning (zero time), middle, and end of the expected shelf life. If a tobacco product does not have a defined shelf life, provide stability data over a specified amount of time and a justification for why that time period is appropriate. Stability testing must be performed for the microbial and chemical endpoints as follows:

(i) Microbial content data including total aerobic microbial count and total yeast and mold count;

(ii) Water activity; and

(iii) Tobacco-specific nitrosamine yields (total, N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), and 4-methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pydridyl)-1-butanone) (NNK)).

(g) *Applicant's basis for substantial equivalence determination.* The applicant must state that the new tobacco product has either:

(1) The same characteristics as the predicate tobacco product and the basis for this determination, or

(2) Different characteristics than the predicate tobacco product. Where an applicant states that its new tobacco product has different characteristics than the predicate tobacco product, the applicant must also include an explanation as to why a difference in any of the following characteristics do not cause the new product to raise different questions of public health: Product design (paragraph (a) of this section); heating source (paragraph (b) of this section); materials and ingredients (paragraph (c) of this section); and other features (paragraph (d) of this section). In addition, to demonstrate that a new tobacco product is substantially equivalent, an applicant must also explain why any differences in the manufacturing process between the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product would not change the characteristics of the new tobacco product such that the new tobacco product could raise different questions of public health (§ 1107.18(e)). Similarly, for smokeless tobacco products and tobacco products that contain fermented tobacco, an applicant must explain why any difference in stability between the new tobacco product and the predicate tobacco product does not cause the new tobacco product to raise different questions of public health (paragraph (f) of this section).

(h) *Comparison to original predicate tobacco product.* If the applicant is comparing the new tobacco product to a predicate tobacco product that FDA has previously found to be substantially equivalent, FDA may request that the applicant include information related to the original predicate tobacco product that was commercially marketed (other than for test marketing) in the United States as of February 15, 2007, even if that original predicate tobacco product is back several predicate tobacco products. FDA will request this information when necessary to ensure that any order the Agency issues finding the new tobacco product substantially equivalent complies with section 910(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. FDA may need to review the first SE Report that received a finding of substantial equivalence using the original predicate tobacco product as a predicate tobacco product in order to make this finding.
