##### § 1288.5 Procedures. #####

(a) *Issuance of DLA POV decal and 3-year validation sticker.* (1) One decal will be affixed to the left front bumper (operator's side) of a four-wheel vehicle. An additional decal may be placed on the rear bumper of the vehicle. For vehicles not equipped with bumpers and two-wheeled vehicles, the placement of decals will be determined locally.

(2) A 3-year validation sticker indicating the decal expiration will be issued at the same time the DLA decal is issued. Every 3 years, or following a significant change, registrants will be required to update their registration information. Evidence of compliance will be documented by the issuance and display of a new 3-year validation sticker.

(3) The validation sticker will be placed next to the DLA decal affixed to the front bumper of the vehicle. This sticker will reflect the month and year of the decal expiration, e.g., vehicles registered during the month of June 1978 will have affixed a validation sticker with the numbers “6-81”, indicating expiration of the decal at the end of June 1981. The specifications for the validation sticker will be determined locally.

(4) Decals or other media used to identify vehicles of temporary registrants or visitors will be locally prescribed.

(5) Decals will be removed from POV's by the registrant when activity registration is terminated. See DLAR 5720.1, chapter 3, for information on termination of registration.

(6) Vehicle decals will be purchased with appropriated funds for issuance at no cost to authorized users.

(b) *Proof of insurance.* (1) Individuals registering vehicles will certify possession of insurance per DLAR 5720.1, paragraph 3-3c.

(2) The certification contained on DLA form 1454 will, as indicated thereon, be witnessed and manifested by a signature.

(c) *Vehicle inspection.* (1) DLA activities located in States or jurisdictions having mandatory vehicle safety inspections will reflect the provisions of DLAR 5720.1, paragraph 3-3d, in the supplementation of this DLAR.

(2) Vehicle safety inspections are not mandatory for DLA activities located in areas not requiring such inspections.
