##### ยง 1288.2 Policy. #####

(a) The operation of a POV on a DLA activity constitutes a conditional privilege extended by the Head of the activity. The Heads of DLA primary level field activities (PLFA's) have the authority to supplement this regulation to implement additional controls and restraints warranted by existing conditions at a PLFA. For example, commanders of depots and supply centers may impose searches of vehicles as warranted to reduce pilferage, and protect Government interests.

(b) POV's permanently registered for operation on a DLA activity will be identified by use of one of the decals prescribed in this part 1288 (appendices A and B).

(c) The DLA vehicle decal will be valid for a period of 3 years from the year and month of issue.

(d) Activities will use DLA Form 1454, Vehicle Registration/Driver Record, as the basic vehicle registration and driver record.

(e) DLA tenant activities will comply with host installation policies and procedures for registering POV's.
