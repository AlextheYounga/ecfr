##### ยง 1700.11 Procedures for information concerning other persons. #####

(a) *In general.* Personal information concerning individuals other than the requester shall not be disclosed under the FOIA if the proposed release would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or, if the information was compiled for law enforcement purposes, it could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. *See* 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(6) and (b)(7)(C). For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

(1) Personal information means any information about an individual that is not a matter of public record, or easily discernible to the public, or protected from disclosure because of the implications that arise from Government possession of such information.

(2) Public interest means the public interest in understanding the operations and activities of the United States Government and not simply any matter that might be of general interest to the requester or members of the public.

(b) *Determination to be made.* In making the required determination under this section and pursuant to Exemptions 6 and 7(C) of the FOIA, ODNI will balance the privacy interests that would be compromised by disclosure against the public interest in release of the requested information.

(c) *Otherwise.* A requester seeking information on a third party is encouraged to provide a signed affidavit or declaration from the third party consenting to disclosure of the information. However, any such statements shall be narrowly construed and the Director, IMO, in the exercise of that officer's discretion and administrative authority, may seek clarification from the third party prior to any or all releases.
