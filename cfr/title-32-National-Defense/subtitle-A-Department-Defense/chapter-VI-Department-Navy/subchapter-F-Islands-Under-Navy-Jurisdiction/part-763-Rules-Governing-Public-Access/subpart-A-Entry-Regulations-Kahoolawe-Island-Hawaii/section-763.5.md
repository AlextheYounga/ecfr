##### ยง 763.5 Entry procedures. #####

(a) It is the policy of the Commander Naval Base to authorize, in accordance with the spirit of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (1978), reasonable access to Kaho'olawe Island during periods when it is not used for military training. However, because there are bombs and other explosives on and under the surface and in the waters of the island, and because there are significant archaeological resources thereon (in 1981, the island was placed on the National Register of Historical Places as an Archaeological District), Navy representatives accompany each island visitation to safeguard both the vistitor(s) and the island's archaeological resources. In this regard, in order to ensure the safety of visitors to the island and its archaeological resources, persons and organizations wishing access to Kaho'olawe Island must comply with the following appropriate procedures: Civilians (except authorized U.S. and State representatives) must:

(1) Request, in writing, access authorization from Commander Naval Base (Code 01K), Pearl Harbor, Hawaii 96860, at least 15 days prior to the access requested, providing therein confirmed access plans (including the exact number of visitors, time, and location of access, designation of person in charge, and any other pertinent information); and

(2) Submit to Commander Naval Base (at the aforementioned address) properly endorsed Standard Liability Release Form (obtainable from Commander Naval Base), for each access participant, at least five (5) days prior to the requested access.

(b) In evaluating each request, the factors just enumerated will be weighed against training commitments, safety requirements, specical projects, and the amount and cost of military supervision necessitated by a granting of the request. Requests for entry will be considered on an individual basis. If a request is granted, the permission to enter Kaho'olawe Island authorizes one visit only, and shall not be construed as authorization for more than one entry unless the authorization itself specifically states otherwise. Moreover, entry pursuant to advance consent, which is not in accordance with the terms and conditions permitted by Commander Naval Base, shall be deemed a violation of this subpart.

(c) For safety reasons, it is not Commander Naval Base policy to permit children below the age of 15 access to Kaho'olawe Island.

(d) The following safety regulations are applicable to visitors to Kaho'olawe Island:

(1) All visitors to the island are required to execute and submit a waiver of government liability form to a designated Navy representative prior to arrival at the island.

(2) Visitors to the island will be escorted by Navy designated Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) technicians to ensure that they stay on cleared paths, avoid impact areas, and do not touch high explosives. For visitor safety, the directions of the military escorts must be followed.

(3) No person will interfere with any EOD escort in the performance of his duties.

(4) Any actual or suspected ordnance found by a visitor shall be reported to the Special Assistant for Kaho'olawe as soon as possible. If he is not in the vicinity, a description and location of the ordnance should be provided to the nearest EOD technician. Everyone, other than EOD personnel, shall remain clear of any ordnance found.

(5) Only the qualified EOD technicians shall touch, examine, remove, attempt to remove, handle either directly or indirectly, or detonate any ordnance, whether found on the surface, beneath the surface or in the waters surrounding Kaho'olawe.

(6) Any proposed hike and procession route shall be provided to the Special Assistant for Kaho'olawe (or his designated representative) for approval and escort coordination at least twenty-four hours in advance of the planned event. Deviation from approved routes will not be allowed. Proposed campsites for overnight hikes shall be similarly provided to, and approved by, the Special Assistant for Kaho'olawe or his designated representative.

(7) No person shall move about the island after sunset unless a bonafide emergency situation arises. The senior Naval officer present shall be immediately notified in case of such emergency.

(8) No person shall commit any offense proscribed by either Federal law or the State of Hawaii Penal Code, as incorporated under the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act, while on the island of Kaho'olawe. Any individual who violates any provisions of these penal codes may be prosecuted by the Federal Government and/or barred from any future access to Kaho'olawe.

(9) No person shall deface, alter, remove, spoil, or destroy any archeological object, feature, or site on the island.

(10) Children shall remain with their parents at all times while on the island.

(11) Visitors are responsible for removing their own trash from the island.

(12) Individuals failing to abide by these safety guidelines will be precluded from future visitations.
