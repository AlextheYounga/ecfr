##### ยง 736.7 Approval by the Attorney General. #####

Prior to the disposition, either competitively or by negotiation, to private interests of a plant or plants, or other property, which cost the Government $1,000,000 or more if real property, or $3,000,000 or more if personal property (other than a patent, process, technique or invention), or of patents, processes, techniques or inventions, irrespective of cost, the Department of the Navy must notify the Attorney General of the proposed disposal and the probable terms and conditions thereof. Within a reasonable time, in no event to exceed sixty days after receiving such notification, the Attorney General will advise the Department of the Navy, whether, insofar as he can determine, the proposed disposition would tend to create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws. In such cases, the Department of the Navy must obtain from the proposed purchaser information regarding its financial status, the anticipated use to be made of the property and any other information as may be required by the Attorney General; the award or final sale must be delayed until the Attorney General advises of his determination.
