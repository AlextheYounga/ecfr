##### § 701.14 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2) materials. #####

Section (a)(2) of the FOIA requires that certain materials routinely be made available for public inspection and copying. The (a)(2) materials are commonly referred to as “reading room” materials and are required to be indexed to facilitate public inspection. (a)(2) materials consist of:

(a) *5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(A) records.* Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, and orders made in the adjudication of cases, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551, that may be cited, used, or relied upon as precedents in future adjudications.

(b) *5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(B) records.* Statements of policy and interpretations that have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register.

(c) *5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(C) records.* Administrative staff manuals and instructions, or portions thereof, that establish DON policy or interpretations of policy that affect a member of the public. This provision does not apply to instructions for employees on tactics and techniques to be used in performing their duties, or to instructions relating only to the internal management of the DON activity. Examples of manuals and instructions not normally made available are:

(1) Those issued for audit, investigation, and inspection purposes, or those that prescribe operational tactics, standards of performance, or criteria for defense, prosecution, or settlement of cases.

(2) Operations and maintenance manuals and technical information concerning munitions, equipment, systems, and foreign intelligence operations.

(d) *5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2)(D) records.* Those (a)(2) records, which because of the nature of the subject matter, have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records. These records are referred to as FOIA-processed (a)(2) records. DON activities shall decide on a case-by-case basis whether records fall into this category based on the following factors: previous experience of the DON activity with similar records; particular circumstances of the records involved, including their nature and the type of information contained in them; and/or the identity and number of requesters and whether there is widespread press, historic, or commercial interest in the records.

(1) This provision is intended for situations where public access in a timely manner is important and it is not intended to apply where there may be a limited number of requests over a short period of time from a few requesters. DON activities may remove the records from this access medium when the appropriate officials determine that access is no longer necessary.

(2) Should a requester submit a FOIA request for FOIA-processed (a)(2) records and insist that the request be processed under FOIA, DON activities shall process the FOIA request. However, DON activities have no obligation to process a FOIA request for (a)(2)(A), (B) and (C) records because these records are required to be made public and not FOIA-processed under paragraph (a)(3) of the FOIA.

(e) However, agency records that are withheld under FOIA from public disclosure, based on one or more of the FOIA exemptions, do not qualify as (a)(2) materials and need not be published in the Federal Register or made available in a library reading room.
