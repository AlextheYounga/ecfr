##### ยง 701.7 Relationship between the FOIA and PA. #####

Not all requesters are knowledgeable of the appropriate statutory authority to cite when requesting records. In some instances, they may cite neither Act, but will imply one or both Acts. For these reasons, the following guidelines are provided to ensure requesters receive the greatest amount of access rights under both Acts:

(a) If the record is required to be released under the FOIA, the PA does not bar its disclosure. Unlike the FOIA, the PA applies only to U.S. citizens and aliens admitted for permanent residence. Subpart F of this part implements the DON's Privacy Act Program.

(b) Requesters who seek records about themselves contained in a PA system of records and who cite or imply only the PA, will have their requests processed under the provisions of both the PA and the FOIA. If the PA system of records is exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1) and the records, or any portion thereof are exempt under the FOIA, the requester shall be so advised with the appropriate PA and FOIA exemption. Appeals shall be processed under both Acts.

(c) Requesters who seek records about themselves that are not contained in a PA system of records and who cite or imply the PA will have their requests processed under the provisions of the FOIA, since the PA does not apply to these records. Appeals shall be processed under the FOIA.

(d) Requesters who seek records about themselves that are contained in a PA system of records and who cite or imply the FOIA or both Acts will have their requests processed under the provisions of both the PA and the FOIA. If the PA system of records is exempt from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1), and the records, or any portion thereof are exempt under the FOIA, the requester shall be so advised with the appropriate PA and FOIA exemption. Appeals shall be processed under both Acts.

(e) Requesters who seek access to agency records that are not part of a PA system of records, and who cite or imply the PA and FOIA, will have their requests processed under FOIA, since the PA does not apply to these records. Appeals shall be processed under the FOIA.

(f) Requesters who seek access to agency records and who cite or imply the FOIA will have their requests and appeals processed under the FOIA.

(g) Requesters shall be advised in final responses which Act(s) was (were) used, inclusive of appeal rights.

(h) The time limits for responding to the request will be determined based on the Act cited. For example, if a requester seeks access under the FOIA for his or her personal records which are contained in a PA system of records, the time limits of the FOIA apply.

(i) Fees will be charged based on the kind of records being requested (*i.e.*, FOIA fees if agency records are requested; PA fees for requesters who are seeking access to information contained in a PA system of record which is retrieved by their name and/or personal identifier).
