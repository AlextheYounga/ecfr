The FOIA is a disclosure statute whose goal is an informed citizenry. Accordingly, records are considered to be releasable, unless they contain information that qualifies for withholding under one or more of the nine FOIA exemptions. The exemptions are identified as 5 U.S.C. 552 (b)(1) through (b)(9).
