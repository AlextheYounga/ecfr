##### ยง 701.52 Computation of fees. #####

(a) It is imperative that DON activities compute all fees to ensure accurate reporting in the Annual FOIA Report, but ensure that only applicable fees be charged to the requester. For example, although we calculate correspondence and preparation costs, these fees are not recoupable from the requester.

(b) DD 2086, Record of Freedom of Information (FOI) Processing Cost, should be filled out accurately to reflect all processing costs, as requesters may solicit a copy of that document to ensure accurate computation of fees. Costs shall be computed on time actually spent. Neither time-based nor dollar-based minimum charges for search, review and duplication are authorized.
