##### § 701.111 Disclosure accounting. #####

Disclosure accounting allows the individual to determine what agencies or persons have been provided information from the record, enable DON activities to advise prior recipients of the record of any subsequent amendments or statements of dispute concerning the record, and provide an audit trail of DON's compliance with 5 U.S.C. 552a. Since the characteristics of various records maintained within the DON vary widely, no uniform method for keeping disclosure accountings is prescribed. The primary criteria are that the selected method be one which will enable an individual to ascertain what persons or agencies have received disclosures pertaining to him/her; provide a basis for informing recipients of subsequent amendments or statements or dispute concerning the record; and, provide a means to prove, if necessary, that the activity has complied with the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a, this subpart and subpart G of this part.

(a) *Record of disclosures made.* DON activities must keep an accurate record of all disclosures made from a record (including those made with the consent of the individual) except those made to DOD personnel for use in performing their official duties and those disclosures made under FOIA. Accordingly, each DON activity with respect to each system of records under its control must keep a record of the date of the disclosure, a description of the information disclosed, the purpose of the disclosure, and the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure was made. OPNAV Form 5211/9, Disclosure Accounting Form, is downloadable from *http://www.privacy.navy.mil* and should be used whenever possible to account for disclosures.

Note:

DON activities do not have to maintain a disclosure accounting for disclosures made under (b)(1), to those officers and employees of an agency which maintains the record who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties or under (b)(2) - which is required under FOIA.

(b) *Retention.* Disclosure accountings must be kept for five years after the disclosure is made or for the life of the record, whichever is longer.

(c) *Right of access.* The record subject has the right of access to the disclosure accounting except when the disclosure was made at the request of a civil or criminal law enforcement agency or when the system of records has been exempted from the requirement to provide access to the disclosure accounting.

(d) *Correction.* A DON activity must inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the agency in accordance with subsection (d) of 5 U.S.C. 552a of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. The exception is for intra-agency “need to know” and FOIA disclosures.

(e) *Accurate accounting.* A DON activity that does not keep a running tabulation of every disclosure at the time it is made, must be able to reconstruct an accurate and complete accounting of disclosures to be able to respond to requests in a timely fashion.
