##### § 701.121 Processing “routine use” disclosures. #####

(a) “*Routine use*” *disclosure.* Individuals or organizations may seek a “routine use” disclosure of information from a DON PA system of records if the system provides for such a disclosure.

(1) The request must be in writing and state that it is being made under a “routine use” established by a specific PA system of records notice. For example: “Under the “routine use” provisions of PA systems notice N05880-1, Security Incident System, that allows release of information to individuals involved in base incidents, their insurance companies, and/or attorneys for the purpose of adjudicating a claim, I am seeking access to a copy of my vehicle accident report to submit a claim to my insurance company. Information needed to locate this record is as follows \* \* \*.”

(2) The individual is provided information needed to adjudicate the claim. A release authority may sign the response letter since a release of responsive information is being disclosed under a “routine use,” there is no “denial” of information (*i.e.*, PA/FOIA exemptions do not apply), and no appeal rights cited.

(3) DON activities shall retain a copy of the request and maintain a disclosure accounting of the information released. (See § 701.111.)

(b) *Failure to cite to a “routine use.”* Individuals or organizations that seek access to information contained in a DON PA system of records under PA/FOIA, but who have access under a “routine use” cited in the systems notice, shall be apprised of the “routine use” access and offered the opportunity to resubmit a “routine use” request, rather than having information denied under PA/FOIA. DON activities shall not make a “routine use” disclosure without having a “routine use” request.

(c) *Frequent “routine use” requests.* DON activities (e.g., security and military police offices) that routinely receive requests for information for which a “routine use” has been established should offer a “routine use” request form. This will eliminate the unnecessary burden of processing requests under PA/FOIA when the limited information being sought is available under a “routine use.”
