##### ยง 701.114 PA enforcement actions. #####

(a) *Administrative remedies.* Any individual who alleges that he/she has been affected adversely by a DON activity's violation of 5 U.S.C. 552a and this subpart may seek relief from SECNAV through administrative channels. It is recommended that the individual first address the issue through the PA coordinator having cognizance over the relevant records or supervisor (if a Government employee). If the complaint is not adequately addressed, the individual may contact CNO (DNS-36) or CMC (ARSF), for assistance.

(b) *Civil court actions.* After exhausting administrative remedies, an individual may file a civil suit in Federal court against a DON activity for the following acts:

(1) *Denial of an amendment request.* The activity head, or his/her designee wrongfully refuses the individual's request for review of the initial denial of an amendment or, after review, wrongfully refuses to amend the record.

(2) *Denial of access.* The activity wrongfully refuses to allow the individual to review the record or wrongfully denies his/her request for a copy of the record.

(3) *Failure to meet recordkeeping standards.* The activity fails to maintain an individual's record with the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness necessary to assure fairness in any determination about the individual's rights, benefits, or privileges and, in fact, makes an adverse determination based on the record.

(4) *Failure to comply with PA.* The activity fails to comply with any other provision of 5 U.S.C. 552a or any rule or regulation issued under 5 U.S.C. 552a and thereby causes the individual to be adversely affected.

(c) *Civil remedies.* In addition to specific remedial actions, 5 U.S.C. 552a provides for the payment of damages, court costs, and attorney fees in some cases.

(d) *Criminal penalties.* 5 U.S.C. 552a authorizes criminal penalties against individuals for violations of its provisions, each punishable by fines up to $5,000.

(1) *Wrongful disclosure.* Any member or employee of DON who, by virtue of his/her employment or position, has possession of or access to records and willfully makes a disclosure knowing that disclosure is in violation of 5 U.S.C. 552a, this subpart or subpart G.

(2) *Maintaining unauthorized records.* Any member or employee of DON who willfully maintains a system of records for which a notice has not been approved and published in the Federal Register.

(3) *Wrongful requesting or obtaining records.* Any person who knowingly and willfully requests or obtains any record concerning an individual from an agency under false pretenses.

(e) *Litigation notification.* Whenever a complaint citing the PA is filed in a U.S. District Court against the DON or any DON employee, the responsible DON activity shall promptly apprise CNO (DNS-36)) and provide a copy of all relevant documents. CNO (DNS-36) will in turn apprise the DPO, who will apprise the DOJ. When a court renders a formal opinion or judgment, copies of the judgment and/or opinion shall be promptly provided to CNO (DNS-36). CNO (DNS-36) will apprise the DPO.
