(a) *DON activities.* Applies to all DON activities that collect, maintain, or disseminate PPI. Applies to DON activities and to contractors, vendors, and other entities that develop, procure, or use Information Technology (IT) systems under contract to DOD/DON, to collect, maintain, or disseminate IIF from or about members of the public.

(b) *Combatant commands.* Applies to the U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) and U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM), except for U.S. Forces Korea as prescribed by DOD Directive 5100.3.

(c) *U.S. citizens and legally admitted aliens.* Applies to living citizens of the U.S. or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent legal residence. Requests for access to information in a PA system of records made by individuals who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents will be processed under the provisions of the FOIA.

(d) *Federal contractors.* Applies to Federal contractors by contract or other legally binding action, whenever a DON contract provides for the operation, maintenance, or use of records contained in a PA system of records to accomplish a DON function.

(1) When a DON activity contracts for the operation or maintenance of a system of records or a portion of a system of records by a contractor, the record system or the portion of the record system affected are considered to be maintained by the DON activity and are subject to this subpart and subpart G of this part.

(2) The contractor and its employees are considered employees of the DON activity for purposes of the sanction provisions of the PA during the performance of the contract.

(3) The Defense Acquisition Regulatory (DAR) Council, which oversees the implementation of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) within DOD, is responsible for developing the specific policies and procedures for soliciting, awarding, and administering contracts that are subject to this subpart and 5 U.S.C. 552a.

(4) Consistent with the FAR regulations, contracts for the operation of a system of records shall identify specifically the record system and the work to be performed, and shall include in the solicitation and resulting contract the terms as prescribed by the FAR (see *http://www.privacy.navy.mil* (Admin Tools)).

(5) DON activities must furnish PA Program guidance to their personnel who solicit and award or administer Government contracts; inform prospective contractors of their responsibilities regarding the DON PA Program; and establish an internal system of contractor performance review to ensure compliance with the DON Privacy Program.

(6) This instruction does not apply to records of a contractor that are:

(i) Established and maintained solely to assist the contractor in making internal contractor management decisions, such as records maintained by the contractor for use in managing the contract;

(ii) Maintained as internal contractor employee records, even when used in conjunction with providing goods or services to a DON activity;

(iii) Maintained as training records by an educational organization contracted by a DON activity to provide training when the records of the contract students are similar to and commingled with training records of other students, such as admission forms, transcripts, and academic counseling and similar records;

(iv) Maintained by a consumer reporting agency to which records have been disclosed under 31 U.S.C. 3711; or

(7) DON activities shall establish contract surveillance programs to ensure contractors comply with the procedures established by the DAR Council.

(8) Disclosing records to a contractor for use in performing a contract let by a DON activity is considered a disclosure within DON (*i.e.,* based on an official need to know). The contractor is considered the agent of DON when receiving and maintaining the records for that activity.

(e) *Precedence.* In case of a conflict, this subpart and subpart G takes precedence over any DON directive that deals with the personal privacy and rights of individuals regarding their personal records, except for disclosure of PPI required by 5 U.S.C. 552 and implemented by Secretary of the Navy (SECNAVINST) 5720.42F.
