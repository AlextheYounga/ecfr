##### ยง 700.842 Authority over passengers. #####

Except as otherwise provided in these regulations or in orders from competent authority, all passengers in a ship or aircraft of the naval service are subject to the authority of the commanding officer and shall conform to the internal regulations and routine of the ship or aircraft. The commanding officer of such ship or aircraft shall take no disciplinary action against a passenger not in the naval service, other than that authorized by law. The commanding officer may, when he or she deems such an action to be necessary for the safety of the ship or aircraft or of any persons embarked, subject a passenger not in the naval service to such restraint as the circumstances require until such time as delivery to the proper authorities is possible. A report of the matter shall be made to an appropriate superior of the passenger.
