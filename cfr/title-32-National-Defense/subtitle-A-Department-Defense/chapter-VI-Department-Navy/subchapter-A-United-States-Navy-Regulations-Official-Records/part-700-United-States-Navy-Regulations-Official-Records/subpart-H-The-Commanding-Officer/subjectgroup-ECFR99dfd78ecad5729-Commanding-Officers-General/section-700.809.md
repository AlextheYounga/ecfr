(2) Such persons shall not be released in territory not under the jurisdiction of the United States without first obtaining the consent of the proper foreign authorities, except where the investigation shows that he entered the command from territory of the foreign state, or that he is a citizen or subject of that state.

(c) If the investigation indicates that such person has committed or attempted to commit an offense punishable under the authority of the commanding officer, the latter shall take such action as he deems necessary.

(d) If the investigation indicates that such a person is a fugitive from justice, or has committed or attempted to commit an offense which requires actions beyond the authority of the commanding officer, the latter shall, at the first opportunity, deliver such person, together with a statement of the circumstances, to the proper civil authorities.

(e) In all cases under paragraph (d) of this section, a report shall be made promptly to the Chief of Naval Operations or the Commandant of the Marine Corps, as appropriate.
