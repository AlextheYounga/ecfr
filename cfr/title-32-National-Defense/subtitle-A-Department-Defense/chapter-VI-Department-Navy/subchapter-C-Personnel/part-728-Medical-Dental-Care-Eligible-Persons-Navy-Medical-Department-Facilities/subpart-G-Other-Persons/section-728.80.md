(a) Civil service employees of all Federal agencies, including teachers employed by Department of Defense Dependent's Schools (DODDS) and their dependents, may be provided hospitalization and necessary outpatient services, (other than occupational health services), on a reimbursable basis, outside the continental limits of the United States and in Alaska, where facilities are not otherwise available in reasonably accessible and appropriate non-Federal hospitals. Except for employees who are serving aboard naval vessels, hospitalization may be furnished only for acute medical and surgical conditions, exclusive of nervous, mental, or contagious diseases or those requiring domiciliary care. Routine dental care, other than dental prosthesis and orthodontia, is authorized on a space available basis provided facilities are not otherwise available in reasonably accessible and appropriate non-Federal facilities.

(b) Such civilian employees and their dependents may be provided medical, surgical, dental treatment, hospitalization, and optometric care at installations in the United States which have been designated remote by the Secretary of the Navy for the purpose of providing medical care.

(c) The major objective of the following programs for civil service employees, regardless of location, is emergency treatment for relief of minor ailments or injuries to keep the employee on the job:

(1) The Department of Labor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP), governs the overall medical care program for employees of the Government who sustain injuries while in the performance of duty, including diseases proximately caused by conditions of employment (see ยง 728.53).

(2) Federal civil service employees and applicants for such employment are authorized services as outlined in chapter 22, section XIII, of the Manual of the Medical Department (MANMED). When appropriated fund and nonappropriated fund employees, including unpaid volunteer employees, require emergency and nonemergency occupational health services due to an illness or an injury on the job, provide this limited care through your occupational health service, emergency room, or evening primary care clinic, as appropriate. This care is rendered free of charge to the employee, the employee's command, or insurance carrier. Included with this group are Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian marine personnel (authorized additional care and services as outlined in BUMINST 6320.52 and care under ยง 728.53(a)(7)) and members of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) serving with the Navy.

(3) Under the technical control of the Surgeon General of the Army, the DOD Civilian Employees' Health Service is responsible for administering the health program for all Federal civil service employees in the District of Columbia area.

(d) Care, other than occupational health services, is provided on a reimbursable basis. Complete and submit, per subpart J, a DD 7 (Report of Treatment Furnished Pay Patients, Hospitalization Furnished, part A) or DD 7A (Report of Treatment Furnished Pay Patients, Outpatient Treatment, part B) when outpatient or inpatient care is rendered.
