##### ยง 728.32 Application for care. #####

Possession of an ID card alone (DD 2 (Retired), PHS-1866-3 (Retired), or DD 1173 (Uniformed Services Identification and Privilege Card)) does not constitute sufficient proof of eligibility. Accordingly, a DEERS check will be instituted per ยง 728.4 (cc) before medical and dental care may be rendered except in emergencies. When required inpatient or outpatient care is beyond the capabilities of the naval MTF, the provisions of ยง 728.34 apply. When required inpatient care cannot be rendered and a decision is made to disengage a CHAMPUS-eligible beneficiary, the provisions of ยง 728.33 apply.
