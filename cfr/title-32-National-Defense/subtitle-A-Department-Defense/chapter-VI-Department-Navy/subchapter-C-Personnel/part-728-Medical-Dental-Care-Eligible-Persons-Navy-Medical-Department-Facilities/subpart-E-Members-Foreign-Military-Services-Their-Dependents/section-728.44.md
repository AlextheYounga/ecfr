(a) *Policies* - (1) *Invitational travel orders screening.* Prior to determining the levels of care authorized or the government or person responsible for payment for care rendered, carefully screen ITOs to detect variations applicable to certain foreign countries. For example, unless orders state differently, Kuwait has a civilian health plan to cover medical expenses of their trainees; trainees from the Federal Republic of Germany are personally responsible for reimbursing for inpatient care provided to their dependents; and all inpatient medical services for trainees from France and their dependents are to be borne by the individual trainee.

(2) *Elective and definitive surgery.* The overall policy with respect to elective and definitive surgery for Security Assistance Training Program (SATP), Foreign Military Sales (FMS) personnel and their dependents is that conservatism will at all times prevail, except bona fide emergency situations which might threaten the life or health of an individual. Generally, elective care is not authorized nor should be started. However, when a commanding officer of a naval MTF considers such care necessary to the early resumption and completion of training, submit the complete facts to the Chief of Naval Operations (OP-63) for approval. Include the patient's name (sponsor's also if patient is an ITO authorized dependent), grade or rate, country of origin, diagnosis, type of elective care being sought, and prognosis.

(3) *Prior to entering training.* Upon arrival of an SATP or FMS trainee in the United States or at an overseas training site, it is discovered that the trainee cannot qualify for training by reason of a physical or mental condition which will require a significant amount of treatment before entering or completing training, return such trainees to their home country immediately or as soon thereafter as travel permits.

(4) *After entering training.* When trainees require hospitalization or are disabled after entering a course of training, return them to their home country as soon as practicable when, in the opinion of the commanding officer of the medical facility, hospitalization or disability will prevent training for a period in excess of 30 days. Forward a copy of the patient's clinical records with the patient. When a trainee is accepted for treatment that is not expected to exceed 30 days, notify the commanding officer of the training acvitity. Further, when a trainee is scheduled for consecutive training sessions convening prior to the expected data of release from a naval MTF, make the next scheduled training activity an information addressee. Upon release from the MTF, direct such trainees to resume training.

(b) *Care authorized.* Generally, all SATP and FMS personnel and their ITO authorized dependents are entitled to care to the same extent. However, certain agreements require that they be charged differently and that certain exclusions apply.
