##### § 728.51 General provisions - the “Economy Act.” #####

The Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535, generally permits agency heads, or heads of major organizational units of agencies, to procure goods and services from other agencies or within their own agency so long as funds for procurement are available, the order is in the best interest of the Government, the source from which the goods or services are ordered can produce them or obtain them by contract, and the internal or inter-agency procurement is more convenient, or less expensive, than commercial procurement. Provisions of the Economy Act apply to requests from other Federal agencies for medical and dental care for beneficiaries for whom they are responsible. Consult specific provisions of the Act respecting financial and acounting limitations and requirements.
