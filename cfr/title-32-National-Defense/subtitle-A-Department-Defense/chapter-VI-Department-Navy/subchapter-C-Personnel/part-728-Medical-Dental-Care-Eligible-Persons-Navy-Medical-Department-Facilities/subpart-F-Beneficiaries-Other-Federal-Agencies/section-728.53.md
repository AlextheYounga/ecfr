##### ยง 728.53 Department of Labor, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) beneficiaries. #####

(a) *Potential beneficiaries.* The following may be beneficiaries of one of the programs sponsored by the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWC) under the conditions set forth. They are not beneficiaries of OWCP until authorized as such by the appropriate district officer of OWCP. However, they may be carried as potential beneficiaries pending OWCP determination of eligibility. DOD civilian employees provided medical services under a Defense or service health program are not included under this authority (see subpart G).

(1) Members and applicants for membership in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps of the Navy, Army, and Air Force, provided the condition necessitating treatment was incurred in line of duty during an off-campus training regimen. Such care is authorized for injury (a disease or illness which is the proximate result of performance of training is considered an injury) incurred while engaged in:

(i) Training.

(ii) Flight instructions.

(iii) Travel to or from training or flight instructions.

(2) The following employees of the Government of the United States, regardless of nationality or place of work, are entitled to receive care as outlined in paragraph (e) of this section for work incurred traumatic injuries at the expense of OWCP. (In addition to injury by accident, a disease or illness which is the proximate result of performance of employment duties is considered an injury.) This category includes but is not limited to:

(i) Civilian student employees in training at Navy and Marine Corps facilities.

(ii) Civilian seamen in the service of vessels operated by the Department of the Army (see paragraph (a)(7) of this section and ยง 728.80(c)(2) for civilian Military Sealift Command (MSC) personnel).

(iii) All civilian employees of the Government except nonappropriated-fund-activity employees. Nonappropriate fund employees may be covered under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (contact cognizant district office of OWCP).

(3) Civilian members of the Civil Air Patrol (except Civil Air Patrol Cadets) for injury or disease which is the proximate result of active service or travel to and from such service, rendered in performance or support of operational missions of the Civil Air Patrol under the direction and written authority of the Air Force.

(4) Former Peace Corps enrollees for injury or disease which is the proximate result of their former employment with the Peace Corps or which was sustained or contracted while located with the Peace Corps outside the United States and its territories.

(5) Former Job Crops enrollees for injury or disease which is the proximate result of employment with the Job Corps.

(6) Former VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) enrollees for injury or disease which is the proximate result of employment with VISTA.

(7) Military Sealift Command (MSC) civilian marine personnel (CIVMARPERS or CIVMARS) (including temporary employees, intermittent employees, and employees with less than 1 year's service) are entitled to occupationally related care at the expense of OWCP. CIVMARS are in a crew status only after reporting to their assigned ship. They are in a travel status from crewing point to ship and return. While in a travel status, they are entitled to the same health care benefits as other Federal civil service employees in a travel status (5 U.S.C. 8101). CIVMARS presenting for treatment with a properly completed CA-16, Request for Examination and/or Treatment, will:

(i) Enter the naval MTF's system through the occupational medicine service.

(ii) Be treated for any injury or disease proximately caused by their employment. Although the actual determination of whether an illness or injury is occupationally related is a function of OWCP, determinations are based on the required injury report along with the treatment record from the attending physician. Therefore, when doubt exists as to the relationship of the condition to the potential patient's employment, the physician should report an unbiased medical conclusion and the medical rationale therefor, indicating the conditions which are responsible for the claimant's disability. As a general rule, the following may be initially considered as occupationally related, however, it should be emphasized that OWCP is the final approval authority:

(A) Any injury or illness occurring as a direct result of employment. May occur on a ship, at a Government installation ashore, or in an aircraft while performing a requirement of employment.

(B) Any injury or illness which becomes manifest while away from work (on leave or liberty) while in a crew status or travel status as long as the condition may be directly related to job activities or to exposures incident to travel to ship assignment.

(C) Required immunizations.

(D) Required physical examinations.

(E) Periodic medical surveillance screening examinations for DOD occupational and industrial health programs, *i.e.*, asbestos medical surveillance, hearing conservation, etc.

(iii) Be referred to a non-Federal source of care where back-to-work care may be provided at the CIVMAR's expense after, if necessary, the immediate emergency is alleviated when a reasonable determination can be made that the injury or illness is not occupationally related.

(A) Per 5 U.S.C. 7901(c)(3), the health service program for Federal civilian employees is limited to referral of employees, upon their request, to private sources of care.

(B) Long term extended care of chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, etc., is not authorized in naval MTFs at the expense of OWCP nor at the CIVMAR's personal expense.

(C) Patients who cannot be referred, because of medical reasons or because non-Federal sources are not available or available but inadequate, may be retained in naval MTFs at the expense of the CIVMAR or of his or her private insurance until transfer becomes possible. Although the means of access to the naval MTF may have been through the occupational medicine service, retention in the naval MTF is on a civilian humanitarian basis. This is also applicable when OWCP disallows a CIVMAR's claim (see paragraph (c) of this section).

(b) *Authorization required.* Personnel in paragraph (a) (1) through (6) may be rendered inpatient and outpatient care as outlined in paragraph (e) of this section, unless otherwise stipulated in this section, upon presentation of a properly prepared and signed authorization from CA-16 (Request for Examination and/or Treatment). District offices of OWCP will honor these authorizations for 60 days unless written notice of termination of authorization is given earlier. Whereas the CA-16 is used primarily for traumatic injuries, it may also be used to authorize examination and treatment for disease or illness provided the affected agency has obtained prior permission from the cognizant district office of OWCP. If the condition for which treatment is requested appears related to employment, treatment of beneficiaries in paragraph (a) (1) through (7) of this section may be initiated without presentation of a CA-16. Patients provided treatment without a CA-16 may be carried as OWCP beneficiaries from the time of initial treatment, provided the appropriate district office of OWCP is notified and requested to submit a CA-16 within 48 hours giving authorization as of the date of actual treatment. OWCP will not be liable for payment of bills for unauthorized treatment. Post hospitalization care following authorized inpatient care does not require an additional authorization. First aid treatment rendered civilian employees does not require an authorization form

(c) *Disallowance by OWCP.* When OWCP determines that any claim should be disallowed, OWCP will advise the naval facility rendering care that no further treatment should be rendered at OWCP expense. The patient ceases to be an OWCP beneficiary as of the date of receipt of the notice of disallowance by the naval MTF and the patient will be so notified. Any treatment subsequent to the date of receipt of the notice of disallowance will be at the personal expense of the patient (see ยง 728.81(a)).

(d) *Authorization for transfer.* Prior approval of OWCP is required before a transfer can be effected, except in an emergency or when immediate treatment is deemed more appropriate in another Federal facility. When transfer is effected without approval, the transferring facility will immediately request such authorization from the appropriate district office of OWCP. When authorized by OWCP, evacuation to the United States can be effected per OPNAVINST 4630.25B. Medical records and a CA-16 will accompany such patients.

(e) *Care authorized* - (1) *Inpatient care.* Medical and surgical care necessary for the proper treatment of the condition upon which eligibility is based. Specific OWCP authorization is required before major surgical procedures can be performed unless the urgency of the situation is such that time does not permit obtaining said authorization. All necessary prostheses, hearing aids, spectacles, and orthopedic appliances will be furnished when required for proper treatment of the condition upon which eligibility is based. Upon specific authorization, damaged or destroyed medical braces, artificial limbs, and other orthopedic and prosthetic devices will be replaced or repaired, except that eyeglasses and hearing aids will not be replaced or repaired unless their damage or destruction is incidental to a personal injury requiring medical services.

(2) *Outpatient care.* Complete medical and surgical care not requiring hospitalization, and posthospitalization services following authorized inpatient care in a naval MTF for the proper treatment of the condition upon which eligibility is based.

(3) *Dental care.* Limit dental treatment to emergencies and that care necessary as an adjunct to inpatient hospital care authorized in advance. Such care will not include dental prostheses, unless specifically authorized, nor orthodontic treatment.

(f) *Reports and records.* (1) Copies of medical records will accompany OWCP patients being transferred from one medical treatment facility to another. Records accompanying OWCP patients to a debarkation hospital will be the same as for military personnel and will clearly identify the patient as an OWCP beneficiary.

(2) Forward a CA-20 (Attending Physician's Report) to the appropriate district office of OWCP on discharge of the patient unless hospitalization exceeds 1 month. In such instances, a report will be submitted every 30 days. When extensive hospitalization is required, use an SF 502 or a narrative format in lieu of CA-20. When submitted to OWCP, the physician's report will include:

(i) History.

(ii) Physical findings.

(iii) Laboratory findings.

(iv) Abstract of hospital records.

(v) Diagnosis for conditions due to injury and not due to injury.

(vi) Rationalized medical opinion for the physician's belief that the illness or disease treated was causally related to a specific condition or set of conditions to which the claimant was subjected.

(vii) Condition on discharge with opinion as to degree of impairment due to injury, if any.

(3) Complete and submit, per subpart J, a DD 7 (Report of Treatment Furnished Pay Patients, Hospitalization Furnished, part A) or DD 7A (Report of Treatment Furnished Pay Patients, Outpatient Treatment, part B) when outpatient or inpatient care is rendered to any OWCP beneficiary.
