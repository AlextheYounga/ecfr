The death gratuity shall equal six months' basic pay (plus special, incentive, and proficiency pay) at the rate to which the deceased member was entitled on the date of his death but shall not be less than $800 nor more than $3,000. A kind of special pay included is the 25% increase in pay to which a member serving on a naval vessel in foreign waters is entitled under 10 U.S.C. 5540 when retained beyond expiration of enlistment because such retention was essential to the public interest.
