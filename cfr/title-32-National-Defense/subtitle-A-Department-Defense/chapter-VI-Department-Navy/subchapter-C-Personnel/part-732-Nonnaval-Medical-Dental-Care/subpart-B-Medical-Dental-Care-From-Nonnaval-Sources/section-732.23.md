##### ยง 732.23 Collection for subsistence. #####

The Navy Pay and Personnel Procedures Manual provides guidance regarding pay account checkage procedures to liquidate subsistence charges incurred by members entitled to care under the provisions of this part. Such members must also be entitled to basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) while hospitalized at Government expense. The responsible activity (the adjudication authority or the naval MTF to which such a member is transferred) should follow procedures outlined in the Navy Pay and Personnel Procedures Manual when an eligible officer or enlisted member of the naval service is subsisted at Department of the Navy expense while hospitalized in a nonnaval treatment facility. Subpart C contains the creditable accounting classification for inpatient subsistence collections.
