(a) *Competency Board.* (1) The commanding officer of the cognizant Naval medical facility will convene a board of not less than three Medical Department officers or physicians, one of whom will be a Navy psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, when there is evidence that a member may be incapable of handling his financial affairs. The board will be convened in accordance with Chapter 18, Manual of the Medical Department (MANMED). The board may include members of the Reserve components on active or inactive duty. When active duty Navy or Marine Corps members are hospitalized in non-Naval medical facilities, the Military Medical Support Office will ensure compliance with Chapter 18, MANMED.

(2) DFAS-CL(CGA) may request the commanding officer of any Naval medical facility, or request the commanding officer of another service medical facility or administrator of a Department of Veterans Affairs medical facility, convene a competency board in accordance with this section to determine the mental capability of a member to manage his financial affairs.

(3) A finding of restoration of competency or capability to manage personal and financial affairs may be accomplished in the same manner specified in Chapter 18, MANMED, except that the board may consist of one or two Medical Department officers or physicians, one of whom must be a Navy psychiatrist or clinical psychologist.

(4) At least one officer on the competency board, preferably the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, will personally observe the member and ensure that the member's medical record, particularly that portion concerning his mental health, is accurate and complete.

(5) The requirement to convene a competency board under this chapter is in addition to and separate from the medical board procedures. Each board member signs the report of the board and certifies whether the member is or is not mentally capable of managing his financial affairs. After approval by the convening authority, the original board report is forwarded to DFAS-CL(CGA).
