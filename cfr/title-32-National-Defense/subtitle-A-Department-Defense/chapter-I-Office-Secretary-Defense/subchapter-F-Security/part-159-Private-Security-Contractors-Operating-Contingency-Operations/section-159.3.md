Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 55283, Sept. 9, 2022.

Unless otherwise noted, these terms and their definitions are for the purpose of this part.

*Area of combat operations.* An area of operations designated as such by the Secretary of Defense for the purpose of this part, when enhanced coordination of PSCs working for U.S.G. agencies is required.

*Contingency operation.* A military operation that is either designated by the Secretary of Defense as a contingency operation or becomes a contingency operation as a matter of law (10 U.S.C. 101(a)(13)). It is a military operation that:

(1) Is designated by the Secretary of Defense as an operation in which members of the Armed Forces are or may become involved in military actions, operations, or hostilities against an enemy of the United States or against an opposing military force; or

(2) Results in the call or order to, or retention on, active duty of members of the uniformed services under section 688, 12301(a), 12302, 12304, 12305, 12406, of 10 U.S.C., chapter 15 of 10 U.S.C. or any other provision of law during a war or during a national emergency declared by the President or Congress.

*Contractor.* The contractor, subcontractor, grantee, or other party carrying out the covered contract.

*Covered contract.* (1) A DoD contract for performance of services and/or delivery of supplies in an area of contingency operations outside the United States or a contract of a non-DoD Federal agency for performance of services and/or delivery of supplies in an area of combat operations or other significant military operations, as designated by the Secretary of Defense; a subcontract at any tier under such a contract; or a task order or delivery order issued under such a contract or subcontract.

(2) Also includes contracts or subcontracts funded under grants and sub-grants by a Federal agency for performance in an area of combat operations or other significant military operations as designated by the Secretary of Defense.

(3) Excludes temporary arrangements entered into by non-DoD contractors or grantees for the performance of private security functions by individual indigenous personnel not affiliated with a local or expatriate security company. Such arrangements must still be in compliance with local law.

*Other significant military operations.* For purposes of this part, the term ‘other significant military operations‘ means activities, other than combat operations, as part of an overseas contingency operation that are carried out by United States Armed Forces in an uncontrolled or unpredictable high-threat environment where personnel performing security functions may be called upon to use deadly force.1

1 With respect to an area of other significant military operations, the requirements of this part shall apply only upon agreement of the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State. Such an agreement of the Secretaries may be made only on an area-by-area basis. With respect to an area of combat operations, the requirements of this part shall always apply.

*Private security functions.* Activities engaged in by a contractor under a covered contract as follows:

(1) Guarding of personnel, facilities, designated sites, or property of a Federal agency, the contractor or subcontractor, or a third party.2

2 Contractors performing private security functions are not authorized to perform inherently governmental functions. In this regard, they are limited to a defensive response to hostile acts or demonstrated hostile intent.

(2) Any other activity for which personnel are required to carry weapons in the performance of their duties in accordance with the terms of their contract. For the DoD, DoDI Instruction 3020.41, “Contractor Personnel Authorized to Accompany the U.S. Armed Forces,”3 prescribes policies related to personnel allowed to carry weapons for self defense.

*PSC personnel.* Any individual performing private security functions under a covered contract.
