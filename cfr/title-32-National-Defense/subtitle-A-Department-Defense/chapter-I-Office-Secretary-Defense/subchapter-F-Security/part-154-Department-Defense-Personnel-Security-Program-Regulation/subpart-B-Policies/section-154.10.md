##### ยง 154.10 Limitations and restrictions. #####

(a) *Authorized requesters and personnel security determination authorities.* Personnel security investigations may be requested and personnel security clearances (including Special Access authorizations as indicated) granted only by those authorities designated in ยง 154.31 and Appendix E.

(b) *Limit investigations and access.* The number of persons cleared for access to classified information shall be kept to a minimum, consistent with the requirements of operations. Special attention shall be given to eliminating unnecessary clearances and requests for personnel security investigations.

(c) *Collection of investigative data.* To the greatest extent practicable, personal information relevant to security determinations shall be obtained directly from the subject of a personnel security investigation. Such additional information required to make the necessary personnel security determination shall be obtained as appropriate from knowledgeable personal sources, particularly the subject's peers, and through checks of relevant records including school, employment, credit, medical, and law enforcement records.

(d) *Privacy Act notification.* Whenever personal information is solicited from an individual preparatory to the initiation of a personnel security investigation, the individual must be informed of -

(1) The authority (statute or Executive order that authorized solicitation);

(2) The principal purpose or purposes for which the information is to be used;

(3) The routine uses to be made of the information;

(4) Whether furnishing such information is mandatory or voluntary;

(5) The effect on the individual, if any, of not providing the information and

(6) That subsequent use of the data may be employed as part of an aperiodic, random process to screen and evaluate continued eligibility for access to classified information.

(e) *Restrictions on investigators.* Investigation shall be carried out insofar as possible to collect only as much information as is relevant and necessary for a proper personnel security determination. Questions concerning personal and domestic affairs, national origin, financial matters, and the status of physical health thus should be avoided unless the question is relevant to the criteria of ยง 154.7. Similarly, the probing of a person's thoughts or beliefs and questions about conduct that have no personnel security implications are unwarranted. When conducting investigations under the provisions of this part, investigators shall:

(1) Investigate only cases or persons assigned within their official duties.

(2) Interview sources only where the interview can take place in reasonably private surroundings.

(3) Always present credentials and inform sources of the reasons for the investigation. Inform sources of the subject's accessibility to the information to be provided and to the identity of the sources providing the information. Restrictions on investigators relating to Privacy Act advisements to subjects of personnel security investigations are outlined in paragraph (d) of this section.

(4) Furnish only necessary identity data to a source, and refrain from asking questions in such a manner as to indicate that the investigator is in possession of derogatory information concerning the subject of the investigation.

(5) Refrain from using, under any circumstances, covert or surreptitious investigative methods, devices, or techniques including mail covers, physical or photographic surveillance, voice analyzers, inspection of trash, paid informants, wiretap, or eavesdropping devices.

(6) Refrain from accepting any case in which the investigator knows of circumstances that might adversely affect his fairness, impartiality, or objectivity.

(7) Refrain, under any circumstances, from conducting physical searches of the subject or his property.

(8) Refrain from attempting to evaluate material contained in medical files. Medical files shall be evaluated for personnel security program purposes only by such personnel as are designated by DoD medical authorities. However, review and collection of medical record information may be accomplished by authorized investigative personnel.

(f) *Polygraph restrictions.* The polygraph may be used as a personnel security screening measure only in those limited instances authorized by the Secretary of Defense in DoD Directive 5210.48.1
