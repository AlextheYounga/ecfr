##### § 154.17 Special access programs. #####

(a) *General.* It is the policy of the Department of Defense to establish, to the extent possible, uniform and consistent personnel security investigative requirements. Accordingly, investigations exceeding established requirements are authorized only when mandated by statute, national regulations, or international agreement. In this connection, there are certain Special Access programs originating at the national or international level that require personnel security investigations and procedures of a special nature. These programs and the special investigative requirements imposed by them are described in this section. A Special Access program is any program designed to control access, distribution, and protection of particularly sensitive information established pursuant to section 4-2 of Executive Order 12356 and prior Orders. Title 32 CFR part 159 governs the establishment of Departmental Special Access Programs.

(b) *Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).* (1) The investigative requirements for access to SCI is an SBI (See paragraph 4, appendix A) including a NAC on the individual's spouse or cohabitant. When conditions indicate, additional investigation shall be conducted on the spouse of the individual and members of the immediate family (or other persons to whom the individual is bound by affection or obligation) to the extent necessary to permit a determination by the adjudication agency that the Personnel Security standards of DCID 1/14 are met.

(2) A previous investigation conducted within the past five years which substantially meets the investigative requirements prescribed by this section may serve as a basis for granting access approval provided that there has been no break in the individual's military service, DoD civilian employment, or access to classified information under the Industrial Security Program greater than 12 months. The individual shall submit one copy of an updated PSQ covering the period since the completion of the last SBI.

(c) *Single Integrated Operation Plan - Extremely Sensitive Information (SIOP-ESI).* The investigative requirement for access to SIOP-ESI is an SBI, including a NAC on the spouse and the individual's immediate family who are 18 years of age or over and who are U.S. citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens.

(d) *Presidential support activities.* (1) DoD Directive 5210.551 prescribes the policies and procedures for the nomination, screening, selection, and continued evaluation of DoD military and civilian personnel and contractor employees assigned to or utilized in Presidential Support activities. The type of investigation of individuals assigned to Presidential Support activities varies according to whether the person investigated qualifies for Category One or Category Two as indicated below:

1 See footnote 1 to § 154.2(c).

(i) *Category one.* (A) Personnel assigned on a permanent or full-time basis to duties in direct support of the President (including the office staff of the Director, White House Military Office, and all individuals under his control):

(*1*) Presidential aircrew and associated maintenance and security personnel.

(*2*) Personnel assigned to the White House communications activities and the Presidential retreat.

(*3*) White House transportation personnel.

(*4*) Presidential mess attendants and medical personnel.

(*5*) Other individuals filling administrative positions at the White House.

(B) Personnel assigned on a temporary or part-time basis to duties supporting the President:

(*1*) Military Social Aides.

(*2*) Selected security, transportation, flight-line safety, and baggage personnel.

(*3*) Others with similar duties.

(C) Personnel assigned to the Office of the Military Aide to the Vice President.

(ii) *Category two.* (A) Personnel assigned to honor guards, ceremonial units, and military bands who perform at Presidential functions and facilities.

(B) Employees of contractors who provide services or contractors employees who require unescorted access to Presidential Support areas, activities, or equipment - including maintenance of the Presidential retreat, communications, and aircraft.

(2) Personnel nominated for Category One duties must have been the subject of an SBI, including a NAC on the spouse and all members of the individual's immediate family of 18 years of age or over who are U.S. citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens. The SBI must have been completed within the 12 months preceding selection for Presidential Support duties. If such an individual marries subsequent to the completion of the SBI, the required spouse check shall be made at that time.

(3) Personnel nominated for Category Two duties must have been the subject of a BI, including a NAC on the spouse and all members of the individual's immediate family of 18 years of age or over who are U.S. citizens other than by birth or who are resident aliens. The BI must have been completed within the 12 months preceding selection for Presidential Support duties. It should be noted that duties (separate and distinct from their Presidential Support responsibilities) of some Category Two personnel may make it necessary for them to have special access clearances which require an SBI.

(4) The U.S. citizenship of foreign-born immediate family members of all Presidential Support nominees must be verified by investigation.

(5) A limited number of Category One personnel having especially sensitive duties have been designated by the Director, White House Military Office as “Category A.” These personnel shall be investigated under special scoping in accordance with the requirements of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Director, White House Military Office and the Special Assistant to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense, July 30, 1980.
