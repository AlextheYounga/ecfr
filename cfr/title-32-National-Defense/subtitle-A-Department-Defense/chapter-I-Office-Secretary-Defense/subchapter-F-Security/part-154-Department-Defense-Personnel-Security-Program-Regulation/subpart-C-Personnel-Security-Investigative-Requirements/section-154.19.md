##### § 154.19 Reinvestigation. #####

(a) *General.* DoD policy prohibits unauthorized and unnecessary investigations. There are, however, certain situations and requirements that necessitate reinvestigation of an individual who has already been investigated under the provisions of this part. It is the policy to limit reinvestigation of individuals to the scope contained in paragraph 5, appendix A to meet overall security requirements. Reinvestigation, generally, is authorized only as follows:

(1) To prove or disprove an allegation relating to the criteria set forth in § 154.7 of this part with respect to an individual holding a security clearance or assigned to a position that requires a trustworthiness determination;

(2) To meet the periodic reinvestigation requirements of this part with respect to those security programs enumerated below; and

(3) Upon individual request, to assess the current eligibility of individuals who did not receive favorable adjudicative action after an initial investigation, if a potential clearance need exists and there are reasonable indications that the factors upon which the adverse determination was made no longer exists.

(b) *Allegations related to disqualification.* Whenever questionable behavior patterns develop, derogatory information is discovered, or inconsistencies arise related to the disqualification criteria outlined in § 154.7 that could have an adverse impact on an individual's security status, a Special Investigative Inquiry (SII), psychiatric, drug or alcohol evaluation, as appropriate, may be requested to resolve all relevant issues in doubt. If it is essential that additional relevant personal data is required from the investigative subject, and the subject fails to furnish the required data, the subject's existing security clearance or assignment to sensitive duties shall be terminated in accordance with § 154.56(b).

(c) *Access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI).* Each individual having current access to SCI shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as set forth in paragraph 5, appendix A.

(d) *Critical-sensitive positions.* Each DoD civilian employee occupying a critical sensitive position shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as set forth in paragraph 5, appendix A.

(e) *Presidential support duties.* Each individual assigned Presidential Support duties shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as set forth in paragraph 5, appendix A.

(f) *NATO staff.* Each individual assigned to a NATO staff position requiring a COSMIC clearance shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as set forth in paragraph 5, appendix A. Those assigned to a NATO staff position requiring a NATO SECRET clearance shall be the subject of a new NAC conducted on a 5-year recurring basis.

(g) *Extraordinarily sensitive duties.* In extremely limited instances, extraordinary national security implications associated with certain SCI duties may require very special compartmentation and other special security measures. In such instances, a Component SOIC may, with the approval of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, request PR's at intervals of less than 5 years as outlined in paragraph 5, appendix A. Such requests shall include full justification and a recommendation as to the desired frequency. In reviewing such requests, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy shall give due consideration to:

(1) The potential damage that might result from the individual's defection or abduction.

(2) The availability and probable effectiveness of means other than reinvestigation to evaluate factors concerning the individual's suitability for continued SCI access.

(h) *Foreign nationals employed by DoD organizations overseas.* Foreign nationals employed by DoD organizations overseas who have been granted a “Limited Access Authorization” pursuant to § 154.16(d) shall be the subject of a PR, as set forth in paragraph 5, appendix A, conducted under the auspices of DIS by the appropriate military department or other U.S. Government investigative agency consistent with § 154.9(e) and appendix I of this part.

(i) *Persons accessing very sensitive information classified Secret.* (1) Heads of DoD Components shall submit a request to the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy for approval to conduct periodic reinvestigations on persons holding Secret clearances who are exposed to very sensitive Secret information.

(2) Generally, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy will only approve periodic reinvestigations of persons having access to Secret information if the unauthorized disclosure of the information in question could reasonably be expected to:

(i) Jeopardize human life or safety.

(ii) Result in the loss of unique or uniquely productive intelligence sources or methods vital to U.S. security.

(iii) Compromise technologies, plans, or procedures vital to the strategic advantage of the United States.

(3) Each individual accessing very sensitive Secret information who has been designated by an authority listed in paragraph A, appendix E as requiring periodic reinvestigation, shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as stated in paragraph 5, appendix A.

(j) *Access to Top Secret information.* Each individual having current access to Top Secret information shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 5-year recurring basis scoped as outlined in paragraph 5, appendix A.

(k) *Personnel occupying computer positions designated ADP-1.* All DoD military, civilians, consultants, and contractor personnel occupying computer positions designated ADP-I, shall be the subject of a PR conducted on a 5-year recurring basis as set forth in paragraph 5, appendix A.
