Planning and preparedness by the Federal Government, including DoD, for civil disturbances is important due to the potential severity of the consequences of such events for the Nation and the population.

(ii) The primary responsibility for protecting life and property and maintaining law and order in the civilian community is vested in State and local governments. Supplementary responsibility is vested by statute in specific agencies of the Federal Government other than DoD. The President has additional powers and responsibilities under the Constitution of the United States to ensure that law and order are maintained.

(iii) Any employment of Federal military forces in support of law enforcement operations shall maintain the primacy of civilian authority, and, unless otherwise directed by the President, responsibility for the management of the Federal response to civil disturbances rests with the Attorney General.
