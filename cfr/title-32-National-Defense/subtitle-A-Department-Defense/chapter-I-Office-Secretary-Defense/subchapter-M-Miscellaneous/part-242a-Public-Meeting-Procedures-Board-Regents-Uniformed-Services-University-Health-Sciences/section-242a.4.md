##### § 242a.4 Grounds on which meetings may be closed, or information may be withheld. #####

Except in a case where the Board or a committee finds that the public interest requires otherwise, the open meeting requirement set forth in the second sentence of § 242a.3(a) shall not apply to any portion of a Board or committee meeting, and the informational disclosure requirements of §§ 242a.5 and 242a.6 shall not apply to any information pertaining to such meeting otherwise required by this part to be disclosed to the public, where the Board or committee as applicable, properly determines that such portion or portions of its meetings or the disclosure of such information is likely to:

(a) Disclose matters that are:

(1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy; and

(2) Properly classified pursuant to such executive order;

(b) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the USUHS;

(c) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than Title 5, U.S. Code 552), provided that such statute:

(1) Requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or

(2) Establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;

(d) Disclose trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person, privileged or confidential;

(e) Involve accusing any person of a crime or formally censuring any person;

(f) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(g) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would:

(1) Interfere with enforcement proceedings;

(2) Deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;

(3) Constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(4) Disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source;

(5) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; or

(6) Endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;

(h) Disclose information contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;

(i) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action, except that this subsection shall not apply in any instance where the agency has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the agency is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final agency action on such proposal; or

(j) Specifically concern the issuance of a subpoena, or USUHS participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the USUHS of a particular case of formal adjudication pursuant to the procedures in Title 5, United States Code, section 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.
