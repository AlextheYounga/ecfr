Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 24708, May 29, 2019.

It is DoD policy that:

(a) Authorization of the customer to whom the financial records pertain shall be sought unless doing so compromises or harmfully delays either a legitimate law enforcement inquiry or a lawful intelligence activity. If the person declines to consent to disclosure, the alternative means of obtaining the records authorized by subpart B shall be utilized.

(b) The provisions of 12 U.S.C. Chapter 35 do not govern obtaining access to financial records maintained by military banking contractors located outside the United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The guidance set forth in Appendix N of subpart B may be used to obtain financial information from these contractor operated facilities.
