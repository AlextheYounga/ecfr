##### § 250.7 Pertinent portions of Export Administration Regulations (EAR). #####

The following pertinent section of the EAR is provided for the guidance of DoD personnel in determining the releasability technical data under the authority of this part.

Export Administration Regulations 15 CFR 379.3General License GTDA: Technical Data Available to All Destinations

A General License designated GTDA is hereby established authorizing the export to all destinations of technical data described in § 379.3(a), (b), or (c), below:

(a) *Data Generally Available.* Data that have been made generally available to the public in any form, including

(1) Data released orally or visually at open conferences, lectures, trade show, or other media open to the public; and

(2) Publications that may be purchased without restrictions at a nominal cost, or obtained without costs, or are readily available at libraries open to the public.

The term “nominal cost” as used in § 379.3(a)(2), is intended to reflect realistically only the cost of preparing and distributing the publication and not the intrinsic value of the technical data. If the cost is as much as to prevent the technical data from being generally available to the public, General License GTDA would not be applicable.

(b) *Scientific or Educational Data.* (1) Dissemination of information not directly and significantly related to design, production, or utilization in industrial processes, including such dissemination by correspondence, attendance at, or participation in, meetings; or

(2) Instruction in academic institutions and academic laboratories, excluding information that involves research under contract related directly and significantly to design, production, or utilization in industrial processes.

(c) *Patent Applications.* Data contained in a patent application, prepared wholly from foreign-origin technical data where such application is being sent to the foreign inventor to be executed and returned to the United States for subsequent filing in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. (No validated export license from the Office of Export Administration is required for data contained in a patent application, or an amendment, modification, supplement, or division thereof for filing in a foreign country in accordance with the regulations of the Patent and Trademark Office 37 CFR part 5. See § 370.10(j).)
