##### § 268.8 Flash report of major foreign debt arrearages. #####

Major foreign debt arrearages are monitored by the NAC. Therefore, periodically DSAA will request flash reports from the DoD Components to satisfy NAC requirements for information on major foreign debt arrearages. For this purpose, a “major” foreign debt arrearage is any country program arrearage which involves the sum of $250,000 or more. Flash reports will be submitted directly to DSAA by the local command in message form with information copies to the next higher command. The report will reflect any significant changes in major foreign debt arrearages from the quarterly foreign indebtedness reports submitted in accordance with § 268.6. Collections, information on increased indebtedness, problems encountered in unsuccessful collection attempts, or country circumstances which may adversely affect collections are examples of the information which should be included in the flash reports.
