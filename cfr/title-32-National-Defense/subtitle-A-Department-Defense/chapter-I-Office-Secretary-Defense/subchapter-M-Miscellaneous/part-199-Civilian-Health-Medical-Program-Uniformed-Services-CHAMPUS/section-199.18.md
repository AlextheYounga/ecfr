##### § 199.18 Uniform HMO Benefit. #####

(a) *In general.* There is established a Uniform HMO Benefit. The purpose of the Uniform HMO benefit is to establish a health benefit option modeled on health maintenance organization plans. This benefit is intended to be uniform wherever offered throughout the United States and to be included in all managed care programs under the MHSS. Most care purchased from civilian health care providers (outside an MTF) will be under the rules of the Uniform HMO Benefit or the Basic CHAMPUS Program (see § 199.4). The Uniform HMO Benefit shall apply only as specified in this section or other sections of this part, and shall be subject to any special applications indicated in such other sections.

(b) *Services covered under the uniform HMO benefit option.* (1) Except as specifically provided or authorized by this section, all CHAMPUS benefits provided, and benefit limitations established, pursuant to this part, shall apply to the Uniform HMO Benefit.

(2) Certain preventive care services not normally provided as part of basic program benefits under CHAMPUS are covered benefits when provided to Prime enrollees by providers in the civilian provider network. Standards for preventive care services shall be developed based on guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Such standards shall establish a specific schedule, including frequency or age specifications for:

(i) Laboratory and x-ray tests, including blood lead, rubella, cholesterol, fecal occult blood testing, and mammography;

(ii) Pap smears;

(iii) Eye exams;

(iv) Immunizations;

(v) Periodic health promotion and disease prevention exams;

(vi) Blood pressure screening;

(vii) Hearing exams;

(viii) Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy;

(ix) Serologic screening; and

(x) Appropriate education and counseling services. The exact services offered shall be established under uniform standards established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs).

(3) In addition to preventive care services provided pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, other benefit enhancements may be added and other benefit restrictions may be waived or relaxed in connection with health care services provided to include the Uniform HMO Benefit. Any such other enhancements or changes must be approved by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) based on uniform standards.

(c) *Enrollment fee under the uniform HMO benefit.* (1) The CHAMPUS annual deductible amount (see § 199.4(f)) is waived under the Uniform HMO Benefit during the period of enrollment. In lieu of a deductible amount, an annual enrollment fee is applicable. The specific enrollment fee requirements shall be published annually by the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), and shall be uniform within the following groups: dependents of active duty members in pay grades of E-4 and below; active duty dependents of sponsors in pay grades E-5 and above; and retirees and their dependents. As an exception to the requirement for uniformity within the group of retirees and their dependents, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) may exempt Survivors of Active Duty Deceased Sponsors and Medically Retired Uniformed Services Members and their Dependents from future increases in enrollment fees.
