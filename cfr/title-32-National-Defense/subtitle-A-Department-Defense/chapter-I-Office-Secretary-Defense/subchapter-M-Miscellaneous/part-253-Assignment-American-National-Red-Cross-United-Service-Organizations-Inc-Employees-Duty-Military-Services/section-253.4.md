##### § 253.4 Policy. #####

(a) It is the policy of the Department of Defense that an employee shall be accepted for assignment to duty with the Military Services overseas only after it first has been determined, based upon an appropriate personnel security investigation, that such acceptance for assignment is clearly consistent with the national interest.

(b) The standard and criteria for determining the security acceptability of an employee for assignment or continuation of assignment with the Military Services overseas shall be identical to those established for making security clearance determinations for personnel employed in private industry under §§ 155.4 and 155.5 of this title.
