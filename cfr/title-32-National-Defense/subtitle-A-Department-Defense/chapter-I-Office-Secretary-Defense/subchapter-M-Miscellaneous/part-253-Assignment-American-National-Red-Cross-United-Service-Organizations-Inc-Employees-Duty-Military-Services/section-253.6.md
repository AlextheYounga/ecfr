##### ยง 253.6 Procedures. #####

(a) Employees who are U.S. citizens shall have been the subject of a national agency check (NAC), completed with favorable results, before being nominated for assignment with the Military Services overseas.

(b) Employees who are not U.S. citizens shall have been the subject of a background investigation (BI), completed with favorable results, before being nominated for assignment with the Military Services overseas.

(c) An employee will not be assigned for duty with the Military Services overseas or continued in such an assignment when it has been determined that assignment or continuation of assignment is not clearly consistent with the national interest.

(d) Completed security forms (DD Form 398, Personnel Security Questionnaire (BI/SBI), or 398-2, Personnel Security Questionnaire (National Agency Check)) shall be forwarded to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO), Defense Investigative Service, for initiation of the NAC or BI, as appropriate.

(e) Upon completion of the appropriate investigation, the results shall be returned to the DISCO where a determination shall be made concerning security acceptability of the employee. If the determination is favorable, the DISCO shall provide a statement to that effect to the Red Cross or the USO. If the DISCO is unable to make a favorable security acceptability determination, the procedures described in paragraph (f)(3), of this section, shall apply.

(f) Whenever any DoD Component or the Red Cross or the USO receives information indicating that an employee's assignment or continuation of assignment with the Military Services overseas may not clearly be consistent with the national interest, the information shall be furnished to the DISCO for appropriate review. In such cases, the following actions shall be taken:

(1) The DISCO shall arrange for the conduct of any investigation warranted to resolve the adverse or questionable information.

(2) In cases arising after the initial security acceptability determination has been made, the DISCO shall review the information or report of investigation to determine whether the security acceptability determination is to continue in effect. If such adjudication is favorable, no further action is required. The Red Cross or the USO will not be notified in such cases in order to preclude the possibility of any adverse inference being drawn.

(3) If, after reviewing the information or report of investigation, the DISCO is unable to make a favorable security acceptability determination, the case shall be referred for further processing in accordance with part 155 of this title.
