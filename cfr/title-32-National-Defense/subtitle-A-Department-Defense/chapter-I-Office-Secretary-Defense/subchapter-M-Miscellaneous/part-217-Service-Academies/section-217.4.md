##### ยง 217.4 Policy. #####

It is DoD policy, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. chapters 403, 603, and 903 and consistent with this part, that:

(a) The academies provide, each year, newly commissioned officers to each Service that have been immersed in the history, traditions, and professional values of the Military Services and developed to be leaders of character, dedicated to a career of professional excellence in service to the Nation.

(b) The accession of those officers generates a core group of innovative leaders capable of thinking critically who will exert positive peer influence to convey and sustain these traditions, attitudes, values, and beliefs essential to the long-term readiness and success of the Military Services.

(c) Active duty service is the primary means of reimbursement for education.

(d) Cadets and midshipmen disenrolling or those disenrolled after the beginning of the third academic year from a Service academy normally will be called to active duty in enlisted status, if fit for service.
