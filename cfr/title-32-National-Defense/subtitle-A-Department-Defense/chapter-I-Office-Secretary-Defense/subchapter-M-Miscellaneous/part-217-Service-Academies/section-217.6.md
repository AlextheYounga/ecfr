##### § 217.6 Procedures. #####

(a) *Academies.* Academies are 4-year educational institutions operated by each of the Military Departments to provide successful candidates with degrees of Bachelor of Science and commissions as military officers. The core of the academies' mission statements will be to educate, train, and inspire men and women to become officers in the Military Services to serve the United States.

(b) *Organization of the academies.* (1) There will be at each academy a superintendent and Commandant appointed by the President, a dean of the faculty, chaplain, permanent professors, an athletic director, and a director of admissions. The Secretaries of the Military Departments may employ as many civilian faculty members as considered necessary.

(2) Incumbents of dean, director of admissions, and permanent professorships held by military personnel will be appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The superintendent and the commandant will be detailed to those positions by the President.

(3) The immediate governance of the academies is by their superintendents, who also will serve as the commanding officers of the academies and their military posts.

(4) The superintendent is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the academy as well as the welfare of cadets or midshipmen and staff.

(5) The dean of the faculty of the academy directs and manages the development and execution of an undergraduate curriculum that recognizes the requirement for graduates to understand technology, while gaining a sound historical perspective and an understanding of different cultures. The curriculum will be broadly based in the physical and social sciences, the study of languages and cultures in areas in which the DoD is engaged, and the arts and humanities.

(6) The commandant directs and manages military education and training programs and exercises command over cadets or midshipmen, as established by law and determined by the superintendent.

(7) The director of athletics directs and manages the intercollegiate athletic programs and other physical fitness programs, as determined by the superintendent. Intercollegiate athletic programs will be in full compliance with all applicable National Collegiate Athletics Association rules and requirements while maintaining the professional and ethical values of the Services.

(8) The academic faculty will consist of civilian and military members in proportions determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. Faculty members will possess a mix of operational experience, academic expertise, and teaching ability. They:

(i) Exemplify the highest standards of ethical and moral conduct and performance established by the Secretaries of the Military Departments concerned, and the superintendents concerned, consistent with this part.

(ii) Participate in the full spectrum of academy programs and activities and the development of their curriculum.

(iii) Actively participate in the professional, moral, and ethical development of cadets and midshipmen as role models, mentors, and through the enforcement of standards of behavior and conduct.

(9) Service members will conduct themselves in accordance with the requirement of exemplary conduct as specified in 10 U.S.C. 3583, 5947, and 8583.

(10) The superintendent will ensure that noninstructional staff consists of the minimum number of people consistent with effective achievement of the objectives of the academy and its military post.

(11) Compensation and benefits for civilian faculty members will be sufficiently competitive to achieve academic excellence at pay levels determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.

(12) Additional guidance about organization of the academies is in 10 U.S.C. chapters 403, 603, and 903.

(c) *Nomination and appointment of cadets and midshipmen.* (1) Nomination, appointment, admission, authorized strength, and allocation of strength among nominating authorities for cadets and midshipmen are prescribed in 10 U.S.C. chapters 403, 603, and 903 and this part.

(2) U.S. cadets and midshipmen will be appointed by the President alone. An appointment is conditional until the cadet or midshipman is admitted.

(3) Appointments will be offered on a competitive basis to nominated candidates having the strongest potential for success as cadets or midshipmen, and ultimately as commissioned officers. The nominating sources will be notified of candidates selected for appointment.

(4) Those selected for appointment must have demonstrated, through evaluations prescribed by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned:

(i) High standards of moral character, personal conduct, and integrity.

(ii) The potential to successfully complete the program of instruction.

(iii) An acceptable level of physical fitness.

(iv) Medical qualification for appointments to the academies and for commissioning as required in 10 U.S.C. chapter 33 and further delineated through examination procedures defined in DoD Directive 5154.25E and medical standards defined in DoD Instruction 6130.03, “Physical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction in the Military Services” (available at *http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/613003p.pdf*), DoD Instruction 6485.01, “Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Military Service Members” (available at *http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/648501p.pdf*), and DoD Instruction 1010.16, “Technical Procedures for the Military Personnel Drug Abuse Testing Program” (available at *http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/101016p.pdf*).

(5) Specific eligibility criteria also guide selection:

(i) *Age.* Applicants must be at least 17 years of age, and not have passed their 23rd birthday on July 1 of the year of entry into an academy.

(iv) *Dependents.* Those appointed as cadets or midshipmen must not have dependents.

(v) *Marital Status.* Those appointed as cadets or midshipmen cannot have a spouse.

(6) The academies will work to ensure timely medical evaluations of applicants. Issues relating to the administrative management of those evaluations that are not resolved to the satisfaction of the academies and the activity performing the evaluation will be forwarded to the ASD(M&RA) for resolution.

(7) To be admitted to an academy, U.S. appointees must take and subscribe to an oath prescribed by law or by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned. If a U.S. candidate for admission refuses to take and subscribe to the prescribed oath, the appointment is terminated.

(d) *Cadets and midshipmen from foreign countries.* (1) Foreign students may receive instruction at an academy; the number may not exceed the limits in 10 U.S.C. chapters 403, 603, and 903. Such instruction will be on a reimbursable basis. The USD(P) designates the countries from which candidates may be selected, and may waive reimbursement, either wholly or partially.

(i) Although not eligible for a formal appointment, foreign students admitted to the academies for a course of study will be called cadets and midshipmen, will be accountable to policies and procedures that govern attendance, and are entitled to the equivalent pay and allowances of a cadet or midshipmen appointed from the United States, and from the same appropriation.

(ii) Foreign students will not take the oath addressed in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, are at no time considered to be serving in any status in the Military Services, and will not be eligible for nor offered a commission in the Military Services upon satisfactory completion of their academy course of study nor eligible to be called to active duty if disenrolled.

(2) Not more than three foreign students from a single country may be enrolled at a single academy without ASD(M&RA) approval. Requests for such approval will be submitted by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, through the USD(P) to the ASD(M&RA). The enrollment restriction does not apply to students participating in exchange programs of up to two semesters' duration.

(3) By the end of May of each year, the USD(C)/CFO will establish the tuition rate for the succeeding school year and publish that rate to the Secretaries of the Military Departments, the USD(P), and the ASD(M&RA).

(4) By the end of June of each year, the USD(P) will publish a list of countries eligible to send students to the academies during the subsequent academic year, specifying reimbursement requirements. That list will be provided to the Secretaries of the Military Departments, the ASD(M&RA), and the responsible U.S. Defense Attaché Offices (USDAOs) or the American embassies, if no servicing USDAO exists.

(5) By the end of August of each year, the superintendent of each academy will extend application invitations, through applicable USDAOs (or the American embassies), to each eligible country. Those invitations will describe admissions procedures and define the country's official sponsorship responsibilities.

(6) The superintendent will manage the selection and notification of candidates and, with the assistance of the applicable USDAO or American embassy, obtain written acknowledgment from the sending government of sponsorship responsibilities and their agreement to reimburse tuition costs, when applicable.

(7) Questions on enrollment or reimbursement will be forwarded to the ASD(M&RA), for resolution with the USD(P).

(e) *Development of cadets and midshipmen.* (1) Development of cadets and midshipmen is prescribed in 10 U.S.C. chapters 403, 603, and 903 and this part.

(2) The normal course of instruction at an academy is 4 years, with selected promising cadets or midshipmen pursuing longer terms when required to meet academy educational or other graduation requirements. The Secretaries of the Military Departments will arrange the course of instruction so that cadets or midshipmen are not required to attend classes on Sunday.

(3) Besides academic preparation, each academy will provide for development of military and leadership skills and physical fitness.

(4) The practice of hazing is prohibited by Department policy and law (see 10 U.S.C. 4352, 6964, and 9352).

(5) An important component in the growth of cadets or midshipmen is the leadership development system. Its purpose is to motivate graduates to seek leadership responsibilities and enable them to think clearly, decide wisely, and act decisively under pressure and in a variety of leadership situations. The leadership development system will be based on:

(i) Positive leadership, equal opportunity, and respect for one another's values, beliefs, and personal dignity.

(ii) Elimination of dysfunctional stress. The Secretaries of the Military Departments concerned and superintendents determine knowledge requirements and procedures for the development and indoctrination of cadets and midshipmen. Memorization of trivia, such as complete menus for meals, is generally inappropriate. Establishment of such requirements will be closely monitored by the academies.

(iii) Emphasis on proper bearing, fitness, and posture. These are important to effective leadership and contribute to overall well-being. Exaggerated forms of posture, speech, or movement generally do not constitute proper military bearing. Establishment of such requirements will be closely monitored by the academies and used only with the knowledge and approval of the superintendents.

(iv) Positive role models; opportunities to learn, practice, and receive feedback; and access to support. Direct support to leadership development will be provided by concurrent and relevant coursework, athletic competition, and hands-on experience to show the relationship between theories of leadership in the classroom and practice of leadership outside the classroom.

(6) The highest ethical and moral standards are expected of the officer corps. The honor systems of the academies will support that expectation by enforcing adherence to standards of behavior embodied in the honor codes or concepts of the academies. Violations of honor standards may constitute a basis for disenrollment.

(f) *Management of cadets and midshipmen.* (1) A U.S. cadet or midshipman entering an academy directly from civilian status assumes a Military Service obligation (MSO) of 8 years, under 10 U.S.C. 651 and DoD Instruction 1304.25, “Fulfilling the Military Service Obligation” (available at *http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/130425p.pdf*).

(2) Cadet and midshipman pay is prescribed by 37 U.S.C. 203(c).

(3) Cadets and midshipmen will meet medical accession standards outlined in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section.

(4) As a condition for providing education at an academy, the Secretary of the Military Department concerned will require that each U.S. cadet or midshipman enter into a written agreement in which he or she agrees:

(i) To complete the course of instruction for graduation specified in the agreement to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer, if tendered, and to serve on active duty for a period specified in the agreement if called to active duty or, at the option of the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, to reimburse the United States for the amount specified by the Secretary of Military Department concerned, as prescribed in this section.

(ii) That if such cadet or midshipman fails to complete the educational requirements specified in the agreement, such person, if so ordered by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, will serve on active duty for a period specified in the agreement.

(iii) That if such person fails to complete the period of active duty specified in the agreement, he or she will reimburse the United States for the amount specified by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned in accordance with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2005 and 37 U.S.C. 303a.

(iv) To such other terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Military Department concerned may prescribe to protect U.S. interests.

(5) An obligation to repay the United States under this section is, for all purposes, a debt owed the United States. A discharge in bankruptcy under Title 11 U.S.C. does not discharge a person from such debt if the discharge order is entered less than 5 years after:

(i) The date of the termination of the agreement or contract on which the debt is based; or

(ii) In the absence of such agreement or contract, the date of the termination of the service on which the debt is based.

(6) The sustainment of high performance standards ensures that cadets and midshipmen who are unwilling or unable to successfully complete the program of instruction at the academy are identified quickly. As defined by the Military Department concerned, cadets or midshipmen who are identified as “deficient” in conduct, studies, or physical fitness, and disenrolled from any academy may not, unless recommended by an academic or academy board, be returned or reappointed to an academy. Those cadets or midshipmen selected for return will be reappointed consistent with the criteria prescribed by the board.

(i) Individuals failing to complete the required course of academy instruction (including disenrollment for academics, conduct, honor code violations, or physical deficiency) will be disenrolled.

(ii) If an appointment is terminated before graduation due to a U.S. cadet's or midshipman's breaching his or her agreement, or if a U.S. cadet or midshipman refuses to accept a commission following graduation, the 8 year MSO will be fulfilled by the period for which the member is ordered to serve on active duty or in the Reserve Component in an applicable enlisted status. He or she may be ordered to active duty for a period not to exceed 4 years under 10 U.S.C. 4348(b), 6959(b), or 9348(b). Policies that apply to U.S. cadets or midshipmen disenrolled from an academy who entered the academy directly from civilian status are:

(A) Fourth and Third Classmen (First and Second Years). A fourth or third classman disenrolled will retain their MSO in accordance with 10 U.S.C. chapter 47 and DoD Instruction 1304.25 but have no active duty service obligation (ADSO).

(B) Second Classmen (Third Year). A second classman resigning before the start of the second class academic year or disenrolled for cause resulting from actions that occurred only before the start of the second class academic year will be discharged as if he or she were a third classman.

(C) Second or First Classmen (Third and Fourth or Subsequent Years). Any second or first classman who is disenrolled and who is not suited for enlisted Military Service for reasons of demonstrated unsuitability, unfitness, or physical disqualification, will be discharged in accordance with the current Military Service regulations that implement this part, to include monetary recoupment. Other second or first class cadets and midshipmen disenrolled after the beginning of the second class academic year, but before completing the course of instruction, may be transferred to the Reserve Component in an enlisted status and ordered to active duty for not less than 2 years, but not more than 4 years and incur an MSO, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4348(b), 6959(b), or 9348(b).

(D) First Classman (Declining Appointment). Any first classman completing the course of instruction and declining to accept an appointment as a commissioned officer may be transferred to the respective Reserve Component in an enlisted status and ordered to active duty for 4 years and incurs a MSO in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 4348(b), 6959(b), and 9348(b) and DoD Directive 1235.10, “Activation, Mobilization, and Demobilization of the Ready Reserve” (available at *http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/123510p.pdf*).

(iii) The disposition of cadets and midshipmen entering an academy from the Regular or Reserve Component of any Military Service (except those who enter an academy by way of its preparatory school from civilian status) and then not completing the program will be determined in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 516:

(A) Fourth and Third Classmen (First and Second Years). If disenrolled during the fourth or third class year, the cadet's or midshipman's Military Service commitment will be equal to the time not served on the original enlistment contract, with all service as a cadet or midshipman counted as service under that contract. Those individuals with less than 1 year remaining in the original enlistment contract may be discharged on approval of the disenrollment by the Military Department concerned.

(B) Second Classmen (Third Year). If disenrolled before the beginning of the second class academic year, the cadet's or midshipman's Military Service commitment will be the same as in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(C) of this section.

(C) Second or First Classmen (Third and Fourth or Subsequent Years). If first and second classmen are disenrolled for issues occurring after the beginning of the second class academic year, their Military Service commitment will be the same as in paragraphs (f)(6)(ii)(C) and (D) of this section, as appropriate, or will be equal to the time not served on the original enlistment contract (with all service as a cadet or midshipman counted as service under that contract), whichever period is longer.

(D) Disenrolled Cadets or Midshipmen not Suited for Enlisted Military Service. A cadet or midshipman who entered into an academy from the Regular or Reserve Component of a Military Service who is subsequently disenrolled from an academy and is not suited for enlisted Military Service because of demonstrated unsuitability, unfitness, or physical disqualification, will be discharged in accordance with DoD Instruction 1332.14, “Enlisted Administrative Separations” (available at *http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/133214p.pdf*) and Military Department regulations that specifically address the disenrollment of cadets or midshipmen.

(E) Military Grade of Disenrolled Cadets or Midshipmen Transferred to the Reserve Component or Active Duty. Whether transferred to the Reserve Component or reverted back to active duty status, the disenrolled cadets and midshipmen retain their prior enlisted grade. However, in no case will the cadet or midshipman be transferred to the Reserve Component in a grade lower than would a similarly situated cadet or midshipman who entered the academy from a civilian status.

(iv) The disposition of U.S. cadets and midshipmen entering an academy by way of its preparatory school from civilian status and then not completing the program will be managed in accordance with paragraph (f)(6)(ii) through (iv) of this section.

(v) A cadet or midshipman tendering a resignation will be required to state a reason for this action. A resignation may be accepted when in the interest of the Military Service. Accepting the resignation will not in and of itself constitute a determination of the U.S. cadet's or midshipman's qualification for enlisted Military Service.

(vi) U.S. cadets or midshipmen who are not ordered to active duty due to their misconduct or unsuitability, or because their petition for relief from an active duty obligation was approved by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, must reimburse the United States in accordance with the requirements of 10 U.S.C. 2005 and 37 U.S.C. 303a for education costs commensurate with time spent at the academy. The Secretary of the Military Department concerned may remit or cancel any part of the indebtedness of a cadet or midshipman to the United States. There may be circumstances when neither Active Duty nor reimbursement is appropriate. The Secretaries of the Military Departments will carefully review the circumstances to determine whether waiving Active Duty or reimbursement is consistent with existing statutory requirements, personnel policies or management objectives, equity and good conscience, and is in the best interest of the United States. Such circumstances may include, but are not limited to, a cadet's or midshipman's death, illness, injury, or other impairment that is not the result of the cadet's or midshipman's misconduct; or needs of the Service.

(vii) Change in Status Notification. When a U.S. cadet or midshipman is disenrolled from an academy and discharged from the Service concerned, the Selective Service System will be notified by the Military Department of the individual's status change.

(viii) Dependency Disenrollment or Resignation. U.S. cadets or midshipman who resign or are disenrolled for violation of the dependency policy may request transfer to the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC). Approval and method of transfer is at the discretion of the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned. Cadets and midshipmen who are approved to transfer to ROTC, graduate, receive a commission, and fulfill their Active Duty Service Obligation (ADSO) are not subject to reimbursement as outlined in this section.

(ix) Disenrollment of cadets and midshipmen for medical disqualification.

(A) Persons separated for being medically disqualified from further Military Service will be separated and will not be obligated for further Military Service or for reimbursing education costs in accordance paragraph (f)(6)(vi) of this section.

(B) Persons separated for reasons in addition to being medically disqualified from further Military Service may be obligated for reimbursing education costs at the discretion of the Military Department concerned.

(C) Cadets and midshipmen who become medically disqualified for appointment (including pregnancy) as a commissioned officer during their senior year, who otherwise would be qualified to complete the course of instruction and be appointed as a commissioned officer, and who are capable of completing the academic course of instruction with their peers, may be permitted by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned to complete the academic course of instruction with award of an academic credential determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.

(D) Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1217, when the Secretary of the Military Department concerned determines that a U.S. cadet or midshipman is medically disqualified for appointment as a commissioned officer due to injury, illness, or disease aggravated or incurred in the line of duty while entitled to cadet or midshipman pay, the Secretary may retire the cadet or midshipman with retired pay in accordance with 10 U.S.C. chapter 61.

(g) *Graduation and commission.* (1) Cadets and midshipmen who complete all requirements prescribed by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned for graduation and appointment may be awarded a bachelor of science degree, and U.S. cadets and midshipmen who meet medical accession standards outlined in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section are eligible to be commissioned, in accordance with 10 U.S.C. chapters 33, 403, 603, and 903.

(2) Graduation leave will be administered in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 702.

(3) Officers appointed from cadet or midshipman status will not be voluntarily released from active duty principally to pursue a professional sports activity with the potential of public affairs or recruiting benefit to the DoD during the initial 2 years of active commissioned service. A waiver to release a cadet or midshipman prior to the completion of 2 years of active service must be approved by the ASD(M&RA). Exceptional personnel with unique talents and abilities may be authorized excess leave or be released from active duty and transferred to the Selective Reserve after completing 2 years of active commissioned service when there is a strong expectation their professional sports activity will provide the DoD with significant favorable media exposure likely to enhance national recruiting or public affairs.

(i) *Approval authority and processing requirements.* Secretaries of the Military Departments will establish the approval authority and specific processing requirements for all requests for excess leave and early release from active duty under this program.

(ii) *Excess leave.* Officers may apply for excess leave, after serving a minimum of 24 months of the current obligated active duty period, for a period not to exceed 1 year, for the purpose of pursuing a professional sports activity with potential recruiting or public affairs benefits to the DoD. The agreement between the individual and the professional sports team or organization must reflect the intent of both parties to employ the individual in a way that brings credit to the DoD. The agreement between the individual and the professional sports team or organization must reflect the intent of both parties to employ the individual in a way that brings credit to the DoD. Personnel are not entitled to pay and allowances while in excess leave status, nor are they entitled to receive disability retired pay if incurring a physical disability while in excess leave status. Officers must:

(A) Remain subject to recall to active duty.

(B) Be in good standing, to include meeting all physical fitness requirements and standards.

(C) Have secured an actual contract or binding commitment with a professional team or organization guaranteeing the opportunity to pursue an activity with potential recruiting benefits as described.

(D) Acknowledge that time served in excess leave will not be used to satisfy an existing ADSO.

(iii) *Early release.* Officers may request early release from their ADSO for the purpose of pursuing a professional sports activity with potential recruiting or public affairs benefits for the DoD. Any agreement between the individual and the professional sports team or organization must reflect the intent of both parties to employ the individual in a way that brings credit to the DoD. Military Departments will notify the ASD(M&RA) when an officer is released early from active duty under this program. In addition to any further requirements as determined appropriate by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, applicants for early release must, at a minimum:

(A) Have served 24 months of the original ADSO.

(B) Be in good standing, to include meeting all physical fitness requirements and standards.

(C) Have secured an actual contract or binding commitment with a professional sports team or organization guaranteeing the opportunity to pursue an activity with potential recruiting benefits as described.

(D) Be assigned to a Selected Reserve unit and meet normal retention requirements based on minimum participation standards in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 10147 and 10148, and be subject to immediate involuntary recall for any reason to complete the period of active duty from which early release was granted.

(E) Acknowledge that the officer is subject to monetary repayment of educational benefits at a prorated share based on the period of unfulfilled ADSO, and that such recoupment is in addition to the two-for-one Selected Reserve obligation required in paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(F) of this section. Officers subject to recoupment under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2005 for receipt of advanced education assistance must reimburse the United States a pro-rata share of the cost of their advanced education assistance based on the period of unfulfilled active duty service.

(F) Agree that, in the event that the officer is no longer under a contract or binding agreement with a professional sports team or organization, the officer will either return to active duty to complete the remaining ADSO, or continue in the Selected Reserve for a period of not less than two times the length of their remaining ADSO, as determined by their Service.

(4) At the discretion of the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, first class cadets or midshipmen not medically qualified for commissioning may be placed on limited duty status, as defined by the Military Department concerned, for up to 1 year until medical commissioning requirements of this section and the Military Service are met. If all requirements are met, the cadet or midshipmen may be commissioned. If these requirements are not met, the cadet or midshipmen will be disenrolled subject to recoupment as discussed in paragraph (f)(6)(ii)(C) and (f)(6)(ix) of this section.

(h) *Academy preparatory schools.* (1) Academy preparatory schools provide an avenue for effective transition to the academy environment. The academy preparatory schools prepare selected candidates for admission who are judged to need additional preparation in academics, physical fitness, or character development.

(i) Each school's programs of instruction will focus on academic preparation and on those areas of personal and physical preparation that reflect the mission of both the academy and the Service concerned.

(ii) The core of the academy preparatory schools' mission statement will be “To motivate, prepare, and evaluate selected candidates in an academic, military, moral, and physical environment, to perform successfully at the \_\_\_ Academy.”

(2) Faculty members will possess academic expertise and teaching prowess. They will exemplify high standards of conduct and performance. Faculty members will be expected to participate in the full spectrum of the school's programs, to include providing leadership, exemplary conduct and moral behavior for cadet candidates and midshipmen candidates to emulate, as well as involvement in the development of curricular and extracurricular activities. Curriculum design will recognize academic preparation as the priority; associated programs will capitalize on economies and efficiencies.

(3) Preparatory school programs will provide tailored individual instruction to strengthen candidate abilities and to correct deficiencies in academic areas emphasized by the academies. Additionally, preparatory school programs will provide supplementary instruction in military orientation, physical development, athletics, leadership, character development, and other specific areas of interest determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.

(i) *Review and oversight.* (1) Service academies will establish quantified performance goals and measures, linked with their respective school's mission statement to annually evaluate the performance of the academies. Metrics will include graduation rate for enrolled candidates. The graduation rates of those entering the academies should be at least 75 percent.

(2) Preparatory schools will establish quantified performance goals and measures, linked with the schools' mission statements to annually evaluate the performance of the preparatory schools. At a minimum, the metrics will include:

(i) *Academy preparatory school to academy entrance ratio.* The ratio of the number of preparatory school students entering the academy to the number that entered prep school should be 70 percent or greater.

(ii) *Preparatory student and direct appointee graduation rate.* The preparatory school students' academy graduation rate should not drop more than 5 percent below the direct appointees' graduation rate.

(3) Boards of Visitors of the academies are established and procedures prescribed by 10 U.S.C. chapters 403, 603, and 903 to inquire into the efficiency and effectiveness of academy operations. The designated federal officer for each Board of Visitors will provide the ASD(M&RA) a copy of each report required by 10 U.S.C. chapter 47 within 60 days of the report's submission to the President.

(4) Oversight by the IG DoD will be provided in accordance with DoD Directive 5106.01 and the Inspector General Act of 1978. When required, the ASD(M&RA) recommends to the IG DoD any areas of academy operations that merit specific review during the subsequent fiscal year.

(5) Annual meetings of the superintendents will be hosted by the academies on a rotating basis and include the commandants, the deans, the directors of admissions and athletics, and others designated by the superintendents. Meeting attendees will discuss performance measures and other matters of collective interest. Meeting attendees will identify plans to address areas requiring corrective action. Following the meeting, the host superintendent will provide the ASD(M&RA) a summary of issues and actions discussed and each Service academy will provide an assessment of their respective service academy and preparatory school.

(j) *Inter-service commissioning.* (1) To be qualified for inter-Service appointment, applicants must meet all graduation requirements and all requirements for commissioning in the gaining Service; and both the gaining and losing Secretaries of the Military Departments concerned must concur in the appointment. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. chapter 33, not more than 12.5 percent of a graduating class from any academy may be commissioned in the Military Services not under the jurisdiction of the Military Department administering that academy.

(2) Once all requirements for inter-Service appointments have been met, endorsements from the losing academy will contain the applicants' current academic transcripts, order of merit standing, record of physical fitness and, if applicable, results of the gaining Service's testing for flight training or other qualification. Applications supported by the losing Military Department will be forwarded to the gaining Military Department no later than November of the calendar year before graduation. The gaining Secretary of the Military Department concerned will act on applications no later than the end of December of the year prior to commissioning and will immediately notify the losing Secretary of the Military Department concerned of decisions. Affected cadets or midshipmen will be quickly notified of the disposition of applications.

(3) Those selected for transfer will be integrated within active duty lists of the gaining Military Service. When seniority on that list relies on academy class standing, they will be initially integrated immediately following the cadet or midshipman holding equal numerical class standing at the academy of the gaining Military Department.
