##### ยง 172.3 Policy. #####

(a) Cash or cash equivalents in the prescribed amounts shall accompany bid deposits for a bid to be considered responsive. Similarly, cash or cash equivalents for the total sales price shall be received by the DoD Components or, in authorized cases, by contractors before the transfer of physical possession to the successful bidder.

(b) Amounts collected by the DoD Components in connection with the sale of excess and surplus property shall be deposited promptly to the U.S. Treasury accounts prescribed in accordance with this instruction. The use of suspense accounts shall be minimal. If the account, ultimately to be credited with the proceeds of a sale, can be determined reasonably at the time funds are collected, the deposit shall be made immediately to that account.

(c) The Secretary of each Military Department shall establish qualified recycling programs. The effort associated with the collecting, processing and selling of recyclable material is in appendix A to this part.

(1) Proceeds from the sale of recyclable material shall be used to reimburse installation-level costs incurred in operation of the recyclable program.

(2) After reimbursement of the cost incurred by the installation to operate the recycling program, installation commanders may use up to 50 percent of remaining sale proceeds for pollution abatement, energy conservation, and occupational safety and health activities. A project may not be carried out for an amount greater than 50 percent of the amount established by law as the maximum amount for a minor construction project.

(3) Any sale proceeds remaining after paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section may be transferred to installation morale or welfare activities.
