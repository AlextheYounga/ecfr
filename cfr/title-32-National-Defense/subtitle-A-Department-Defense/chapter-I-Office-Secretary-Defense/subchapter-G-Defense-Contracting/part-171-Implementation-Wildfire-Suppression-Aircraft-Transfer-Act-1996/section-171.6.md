##### § 171.6 Reutilization and transfer procedures. #####

Prior to any sales effort, the Secretary of Defense shall, to the maximum extent practicable, consult with the Administrator of GSA, and with the heads of other Federal departments and agencies as appropriate, regarding reutilization and transfer requirements for aircraft and aircraft parts under this Act (see Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M, paragraphs B 2 b (1) through B 2 b (3)).

(a) DOD reutilization:

(1) USDA shall notify Army, Navy, and/or Air Force, in writing, of their aircraft requirements as they arise, by aircraft type listed in Attachment 1 of Chapter 4 of DOD 4160.21-M.

(2) If a DOD requirement exists, the owning Military Service shall advise USDA, in writing, that it will be issuing the aircraft to satisfy the DOD reutilization requirement. If USDA disputes the validity of the DOD requirement, it shall send a written notice of dispute to the owning Military Service and ADUSD(L&MR/SCI) within thirty (30) days of its notice from the Military Service. ADUSD(L&MR/SCI) shall then resolve the dispute, in writing. The aircraft may not be issued until the dispute has been resolved.

(b) Federal agency transfer:

(1) The Military Service must report aircraft which survive reutilization screening to GSA Region 9 on a Standard Form 120. GSA shall screen for Federal agency transfer requirements in accordance with the FPMR.

(2) If a Federal agency requirement exists, GSA shall advise USDA, in writing, that it will be issuing the aircraft to satisfy the Federal agency requirement. If USDA disputes the validity of the Federal requirement, it shall send a written notice of dispute to the owning Military Service and ADUSD(L&MR/SCI) within thirty (30) days of its notice from the Military Service. ADUSD(L&MR/SCI) shall then resolve the dispute, in writing. The aircraft cannot be issued until the dispute has been resolved.

(c) The Military Services shall:

(1) Report aircraft which survive transfer screening and are ready for sale to Headquarters, Defense Reutilization and Marketing Service, ATTN: DRMS-LMI, Federal Center, 74 Washington Avenue North, Battle Creek, Michigan 49017-3092.

Aircraft shall not be available nor offered to airtanker operators from the Military Service's airfield. The Military Service shall be responsible for the AMARC aircraft induction charges. The gaining customer will be liable for all AMARC withdrawal charges, to include any aircraft preparation required from AMARC. Sale of parts required for aircraft preparation is limited to those not required for the operational mission forces, and only if authorized by specific authority of the respective Military Service's weapon system program manager.
