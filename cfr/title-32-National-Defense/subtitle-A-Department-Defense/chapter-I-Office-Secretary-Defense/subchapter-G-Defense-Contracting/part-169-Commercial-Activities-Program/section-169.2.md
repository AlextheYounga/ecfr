##### § 169.2 Applicability and scope. #####

This part:

(a) Applies to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Military Departments, and the Defense Agencies (hereafter referred to collectively as “DoD Components”).

(b) Encompasses DoD policy for CAs in the United States, its territories and possessions, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

(c) Is not mandatory for CAs staffed solely with DoD civilian personnel paid by nonappropriated funds, such as military exchanges. However, this part is mandatory for CAs when they are staffed partially with DoD civilian personnel paid by or reimbursed from appropriated funds, such as libraries, open messes, and other morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) activities. When related installation support functions are being cost-compared under a single solicitation, a DoD Component may decide that it is practical to include activities staffed solely with DoD civilian personnel paid by nonappropriated funds.

(d) Does not apply to DoD governmental functions as defined § 169.3.

(e) Does not apply when contrary to law, Executive orders, or any treaty or international agreement.

(f) Does not apply in times of a declared war or military mobilization.

(g) Does not provide authority to enter into contracts.

(h) Does not apply to the conduct of research and development, except for severable in-house CAs that support research and development, such as those listed in enclosure 3 of DoD Instruction 4100.331 (32 CFR part 169a).

1 Copies may be obtained, if needed, from the U.S. Naval Publications and Forms Center, ATTN: Code 1053, 5801 Tabor Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19120.

(i) Does not justify conversion to contract solely to avoid personnel ceilings or salary limitations.

(j) Does not authorize contracts that establish an employer-employee relationship between the Department of Defense and contractor employees, as described in FAR 37.104.
