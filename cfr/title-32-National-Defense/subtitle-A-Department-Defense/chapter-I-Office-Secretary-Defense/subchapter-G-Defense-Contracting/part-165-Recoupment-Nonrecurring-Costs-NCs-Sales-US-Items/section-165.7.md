##### ยง 165.7 Waivers (including reductions). #####

(a) Title 22, U.S.C. 2761(e)(1)(B) requires the recoupment of a proportionate amount of NCs of MDE from foreign military sales customers.

(b) Pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2761(e)(2)(A), a waiver or reduction in the NC for a specific sale may be made if the sale will significantly advance U.S. Government interests in:

(1) Standardization with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

(2) Standardization with Australia, Israel, Japan, New Zealand, or the Republic of Korea in furtherance of mutual defense treaties with one or more of those countries.

(3) Foreign procurement in the United States under a co-production agreement.

(c) In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2761(e)(2)(B), a waiver may be made if:

(1) Imposition of an NC recoupment charge likely would result in the loss of the sale; or,

(2) The sale is for an MDE also being procured for the Military Services, and will result in DoD unit cost savings that substantially offset the revenue foregone by waiving the recoupment charge because the total quantity of purchased equipment caused a reduction in the unit cost.

(d) In accordance with 22 U.S.C. 2761(e)(2)(C), any increase in a NC charge previously approved as appropriate may be waived for a particular sale if the increase results from a correction of an estimate of the production quantity base that was used for calculating the charge.

(e) Requests for waivers should originate with the foreign government and shall provide information on the extent of standardization to be derived as a result of the waiver.

(1) Blanket waiver requests should not be submitted and shall not be considered.

(2) A waiver request shall not be considered for a sale that was accepted without an NC recoupment charge waiver, unless the acceptance was conditional on consideration of the waiver request.

(3) Requests for waivers shall be processed expeditiously, and approved or disapproved by USD(P) within 60 days of receipt. A waiver in whole or in part of the recoupment charge or a denial of the request shall be provided in writing.
