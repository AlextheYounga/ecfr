##### ยง 169a.10 Contracts. #####

When contract cost becomes unreasonable or performance becomes unsatisfactory, the requirement must be resolicited. If the DoD Component competes in the resolicitation, then a cost comparison of a contracted CA shall be performed in accordance with part III of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76 (Office of Federal Procurement Policy pamphlet No. 4)6, part II of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76 (Management Study Guide)7, part IV of the Supplement to OMB Circular A-76 (Cost Comparison Handbook)8, if in-house performance is feasible. When contracted CAs are justified for conversion to in-house performance, the contract will be allowed to expire (options will not be exercised) once in-house capability is established.
