##### ยง 169a.11 Expansions. #####

In cases where expansion of an in-house commercial activity is anticipated, a review of the entire commercial activity, including the proposed expansion, shall be conducted to determine if performance by DoD personnel is authorized for national defense reasons, because no commercial source is available, or because it is in the best interest of direct patient care. If performance by DoD personnel is not justified under these criteria, a cost comparison of the entire activity shall be performed. Government facilities and equipment normally will not be expanded to accommodate expansions if adequate and cost effective contractor facilities and equipment are available.
