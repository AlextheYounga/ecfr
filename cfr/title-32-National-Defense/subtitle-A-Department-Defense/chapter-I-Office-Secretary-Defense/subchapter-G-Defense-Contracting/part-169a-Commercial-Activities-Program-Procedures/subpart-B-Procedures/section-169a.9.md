##### ยง 169a.9 Reviews: Existing in-house commercial activities. #####

(a) DoD components shall conduct reviews of in-house CAs in accordance with their established review schedules. Existing in-house CAs, once reviewed shall be retained in-house without a cost comparison only when certain conditions are satisfied. (Detailed documentation will be maintained to support the decision to continue in-house performance). These conditions are as follows:

(1) *National Defense.* In most cases, application of this criteria shall be made considering the wartime and peacetime duties of the specific positions involved rather than in terms of broad functions.

(i) A CA, staffed with military personnel who are assigned to the activity, may be retained in-house for national defense reason when the following apply.

(A) The CA is essential for training or experience in required military skills;

(B) The CA is needed to provide appropriate work assignments for a rotation base for overseas or sea-to-shore assignments; or

(C) The CA is necessary to provide career progression to needed military skill levels.

(ii) *Core logistics activities.* The core logistics capability reported to Congress, March 29, 1984, under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2646 is comprised of the facilities, equipment, and management personnel at the activities listed in the report. The work at those activities may be performed by either government or contractor personnel, whichever is more cost effective. Core logistics activities reported to Congress under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2646, shall be retained in-house unless the Secretary of Defense grants a waiver as provided for in 10 U.S.C. 2464. Requests for waivers shall be submitted to the ASD (P&L). DoD Components may propose to the ASD (P&L) additional core logistics capability for inclusion in the list of core logistics activities. Core logistics activities reported to Congress as additions to the original list shall be retained in-house unless subsequently waived by the Secretary of Defense.

(iii) If the DoD Component has a larger number of similar CAs with a small number of essential military personnel in each CA, action shall be taken, when appropriate, to consolidate the military positions consistent with military requirements so that economical performance by either DoD civilian employees or by contract can be explored for accomplishing a portion of the work.

(iv) The DoD Components may propose to the ASD (P&L) other criteria for exempting CAs for national defense reasons.

(2) *No satisfactory commercial source available.* A DoD commercial activity may be performed by DoD personnel when it can be demonstrated that:

(i) There is no satisfactory commercial source capable of providing the product or service that is needed. Before concluding that there is no satisfactory commercial source available, the DoD Component shall make all reasonable efforts to identify available sources.

(A) DoD Components' efforts to find satisfactory commercial sources shall be carried out in accordance with the FAR and Defense FAR Supplement (DFAS) including review of bidders lists and inventories of contractors, consideration of preferential procurement programs, and requests for help from Government agencies such as the Small Business Administration.

(B) Where the availability of commercial sources is uncertain, the DoD Component will place up to three notices of the requirement in the *Commerce Business Daily* (CBD) over a 90-day period. (Notices will be in the format specified in FAR, 48 CFR part 5 and part 7, subpart 7.3) When a bona fide urgent requirement occurs, the publication period in the CBD may be reduced to two notices, 15 days apart. Specifications and requirements in the notice will not be unduly restrictive and will not exceed those required of Government personnel or operations.

(ii) Use of a commercial source would cause an unacceptable delay or disruption of an essential program. In-house operation of a commercial activity on the basis that use of a commercial source would cause an unacceptable delay or disrupt an essential DoD program requires a specific documented explanation.

(A) The delay or disruption must be specific as to cost, time, and performance measures.

(B) The disruption must be shown to be a lasting or unacceptable nature. Temporary disruption caused by conversion to contract is not sufficient support for the use of this criteria.

(C) The fact that a DoD commercial activity involves a classified program, or is part of a DoD Component's basic mission, or that there is the possibility of a strike by contract employees is not adequate reason for Government performance of that activity. Further, urgency alone is not an adequate reason to continue Government operation of a commercial activity. It must be shown that commercial sources are not able, and the Government is able, to provide the product or service when needed.

(D) Use of an exemption due to an unacceptable delay or disruption of an essential program shall be approved by the DoD Component's central point of contact office. This authority may be redelegated.

(3) *Patient Care.* Commercial activities at DoD hospitals may be performed by DoD personnel when it is determined by the head of the DoD Component or his designee, in consultation with the DoD Component's chief medical director, that performance by DoD personnel would be in the best interest of direct patient care.
