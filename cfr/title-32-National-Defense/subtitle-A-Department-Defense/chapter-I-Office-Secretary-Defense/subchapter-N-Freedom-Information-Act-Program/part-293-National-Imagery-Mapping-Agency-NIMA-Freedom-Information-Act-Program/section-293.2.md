##### ยง 293.2 Policy. #####

It is NIMA policy that:

(a) Agency records that, if disclosed, would cause no foreseeable harm to an interest protected by a FOIA exemption, will be made readily accessible to the public.

(b) NIMA organizations will ensure that internal procedural matters do not unnecessarily impede a FOIA requester from promptly obtaining NIMA records.
