##### § 299.2 Definitions. #####

Terms used in this part, with the exception of the terms in § 299.4, are defined in DoD 5400.7-R. For ease of reference, however, some terms are defined in this section.

(a) *FOIA request.* (1) A written request for NSA/CSS records, that reasonably describes the records sought, made by any person, including a member of the public (U.S. or foreign citizen/entity), an organization or a business, but not including a Federal Agency or a fugitive from the law that either explicitly or implicitly invokes 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552a, as amended, DoD 5400.7-R, or NSA/CSS Freedom of Information Act Program, within the National Security Agency/Central Security Service. Requesters should also indicate a willingness to pay fees associated with the processing of their request or, in the alternative, why a waiver of fee may be appropriate.

(2) An FOIA request may be submitted by U.S. mail or its equivalent, by facsimile or electronically through the NSA FOIA Home Page on the Internet. The mailing address is FOIA/PA Services (DC321), National Security Agency, 9800 Savage Road STE 6248, Ft. George G. Meade, MD 20755-6248. The Web-based system contains a form to be completed by the requester, requiring name and postal mailing address. The URL is *http://www.nsa.gov/docs/efoia/.*

(3) When a request meeting the requirements stated in this section is received by the FOIA office and there is no remaining question about fees, that request is considered perfected.

(b) *Privacy Act (PA) request.* A written request submitted by a U.S. citizen or an alien admitted for permanent residence for access to or amendment of records on himself/herself which are contained in a PA system of records. For purposes of this part, PA request refers to a request for copies of records. Regardless of whether the requester cites the FOIA, PA or neither law, the request will be processed under both this part and NSA/CSS Regulation 10-35, Implementation of the Privacy Act of 1974.3.

3 Copies may be obtained through a FOIA request to the National Security Agency, Ft. George G. Meade, MD 20755-6248.

(c) *Agency records.* (1) The products of data compilation, such as all books, papers, maps, and photographs, machine readable materials, including those in electronic form or format (including e-mails), or other documentary materials, regardless of physical form or characteristics, made or received by an agency of the United States Government under Federal law in connection with the transaction of public business and in NSA/CSS's possession and control at the time the FOIA request is made. The term “records” does not include:

(i) Objects or articles such as structures, furniture, vehicles and equipment, whatever their historical value or value as evidence;

(ii) Intangible records such as an individual's memory or oral communication; and

(iii) Personal records of an individual not subject to agency creation or retention requirements, created and maintained primarily for the convenience of an agency employee, and not distributed to other agency employees for their official use.

(2) A record must exist and be in the possession and control of the NSA/CSS at the time of the request to be subject to this part. There is no obligation to create or compile a record or obtain a record not in the possession of the NSA/CSS to satisfy an FOIA request. The NSA/CSS may compile or create a new record when doing so would be less burdensome to the Agency than providing existing records and the requester does not object.

(3) Hard copy or electronic records that are subject to FOIA requests under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) and are available through an established distribution system on the Internet, normally need not be processed under the FOIA. The Agency shall provide guidance to the requester on how to obtain the material outside of the FOIA process. If the requester insists that the request be processed under the FOIA, then it shall be so processed.
