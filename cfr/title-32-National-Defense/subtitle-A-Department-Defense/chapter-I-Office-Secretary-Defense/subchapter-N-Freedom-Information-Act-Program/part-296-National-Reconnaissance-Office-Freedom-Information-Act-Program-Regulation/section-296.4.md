##### ยง 296.4 Procedures for request of records. #####

(a) *Requests.* Requests for access to records of the National Reconnaissance Office may be filed by mail or FAX addressed to the Chief, Information Access and Release Center, National Reconnaissance Office, 14675 Lee Road, Chantilly, VA 20151-1715, FAX Number (703) 808-5082. Requests need not be made on any special form but must be by letter or FAX or other written statement identifying the request as a Freedom of Information Act request and setting forth sufficient information reasonably describing the requested record. All requests should contain a willingness to pay assessable FOIA fees.

(b) *Date of acceptance.* The requestor shall be promptly informed by letter of the date of acceptance of the request. The search conducted pursuant to that request shall be for records in existence as of and through the acceptance date.

(c) *Determination and notification.* When the requested record has been located and identified, the Initial Denial Authority shall determine whether the record is one which, consistent with statutory requirements, executive orders and appropriate directives, may be released or may contain information that is exempt under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552. Normally, the Initial Denial Authority shall notify the requestor of the determination within 20 working days of the receipt of the request.

(d) *Multi-track processing.* The NRO has 3 queues in which requests may be processed when a significant number of pending requests prevents a response within 20 working days, all based on the date of receipt, first-in first-out, and the amount of work, time, and volume involved in processing the requests.

(See subparagraph C1.5.4.2. of DoD 5400.7-R1, Sept 1998). The queues are:

(1) *Simple.* Those requests which are easily handled and processed.

(2) *Complex.* Those requests which are complicated by multiple searches, co-ordinations, consultations, volume etc.

(3) *Expedited.* Expedited processing shall be granted to a requestor after the requestor asks for and demonstrates a compelling need for the information (paragraph C1.5.4.3. of DoD 5400.7-R)

(e) *Extension of response time.* In unusual circumstances when additional time is needed to respond, the Initial Denial Authority shall notify the requestor in writing of the reasons therefore, and an anticipated date, not to exceed 10 additional working days, on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. The Initial Denial Authority will normally send this notification within 20 working days from receipt of the request. Should it be determined that this 10 additional working days cannot be met, the requestor shall be notified and offered the opportunity to limit or narrow the scope of the request in order to facilitate faster processing, or to arrange an alternative time for processing the request (paragraph C1.5.2.6. of DoD 5400.7-R)

(f) *Fees* - (1) *General.* As a component of the Department of Defense, the applicable published Department rules and schedules with respect to the schedule of fees chargeable and waiver of fees will also be the policy of NRO. See 32 CFR 286.33.

(2) *Advance payments.* (i) Where a total fee to be assessed is estimated to exceed $250, advance payment of the estimated fee will be required before processing of the request, except where assurances of full payment are received from a requestor with a history of prompt payment. Where a requestor has previously failed to pay a fee within 30 calendar days of the date of the billing, the requestor will be required to pay the full amount owed, plus any applicable interest, or demonstrate that he or she has paid the fee, as well as make an advance payment of the full amount of any estimated fee before processing of a new or pending request continues.

(ii) For all other requests, advance payment, i.e., a payment made before work is commenced, will not be required. Payment for work already completed is not an advance payment. Responses will not be held pending receipt of fees from requestors with a history of prompt payment. Fees should be paid by certified check or postal money order forwarded to the Chief, Information Access and Release Center (IARC) and made payable to the Treasurer of the United States.
