##### § 32.22 Payment. #####

(a) Payment methods shall minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds from the United States Treasury and the issuance or redemption of checks, warrants, or payment by other means by the recipients. Payment methods of State agencies or instrumentalities shall be consistent with Treasury-State agreements under the Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) (31 U.S.C. 3335 and 6503) or default procedures in 31 CFR part 205.

(b) Recipients are to be paid in advance, provided they maintain or demonstrate the willingness to maintain:

(1) Written procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds and disbursement by the recipient; and

(2) Financial management systems that meet the standards for fund control and accountability as established in § 32.21. Cash advances to a recipient organization shall be limited to the minimum amounts needed and be timed to be in accordance with the actual, immediate cash requirements of the recipient organization in carrying out the purpose of the approved program or project. The timing and amount of cash advances shall be as close as is administratively feasible to the actual disbursements by the recipient organization for direct program or project costs and the proportionate share of any allowable indirect costs.

(c) Whenever possible, advances shall be consolidated to cover anticipated cash needs for all awards made by the DoD Component to the recipient.

(1) Advance payment mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Treasury check and electronic funds transfer.

(2) Advance payment mechanisms are subject to 31 CFR part 205.

(3) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for advances and reimbursements at least monthly when electronic fund transfers are not used.

(d) Requests for Treasury check advance payment shall be submitted on SF-270,3 “Request for Advance or Reimbursement,” or other forms as may be authorized by OMB. This form is not to be used when Treasury check advance payments are made to the recipient automatically through the use of a predetermined payment schedule or if inconsistent with DoD procedures for electronic funds transfer.

3 See footnote 2 to § 32.12(a).

(e) Reimbursement is the preferred method when the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section cannot be met. DoD Components may also use this method on any construction agreement, or if the major portion of the construction project is accomplished through private market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance constitutes a minor portion of the project.

(1) When the reimbursement method is used, the responsible DoD payment office generally makes payment within 30 calendar days after receipt of the billing by the office designated to receive the billing, unless the billing is improper (for further information about timeframes for payments, see 32 CFR 22.810(c)(3)(ii)).

(2) Recipients shall be authorized to submit requests for reimbursement at least monthly when electronic funds transfers are not used.

(f) If a recipient cannot meet the criteria for advance payments and the grants officer, in consultation with the program manager, has determined that reimbursement is not feasible because the recipient lacks sufficient working capital, the award may provide for cash on a working capital advance basis. Under this procedure, the award shall provide for advancing cash to the recipient to cover its estimated disbursement needs for an initial period generally geared to the awardee's disbursing cycle. Thereafter, the award shall provide for reimbursing the recipient for its actual cash disbursements. The working capital advance method of payment shall not be used for recipients unwilling or unable to provide timely advances to their subrecipient to meet the subrecipient's actual cash disbursements.

(g) To the extent available, recipients shall disburse funds available from repayments to and interest earned on a revolving fund, program income, rebates, refunds, contract settlements, audit recoveries and interest earned on such funds before requesting additional cash payments.

(h) Unless otherwise required by statute, grants officers shall not withhold payments for proper charges made by recipients at any time during the project period unless:

(1) A recipient has failed to comply with the project objectives, the terms and conditions of the award, or Federal reporting requirements; or

(2) The recipient or subrecipient is delinquent in a debt to the United States under OMB Circular A-129, “Managing Federal Credit Programs” (see definitions of “debt” and “delinquent debt,” at 32 CFR 22.105). Under such conditions, the grants officer may, upon reasonable notice, inform the recipient that payments shall not be made for obligations incurred after a specified date until the conditions are corrected or the indebtedness to the Federal Government is liquidated (also see 32 CFR 22.420(b)(2) and 22.820).

(i) Standards governing the use of banks and other institutions as depositories of funds advanced under awards are as follows:

(1) Except for situations described in paragraph (i)(2) of this section, DoD Components shall not require separate depository accounts for funds provided to a recipient or establish any eligibility requirements for depositories for funds provided to a recipient. However, recipients must be able to account for the receipt, obligation and expenditure of funds.

(2) Advances of Federal funds shall be deposited and maintained in insured accounts whenever possible.

(j) Consistent with the national goal of expanding the opportunities for women-owned and minority-owned business enterprises, recipients shall be encouraged to use women-owned and minority-owned banks (a bank which is owned at least 50 percent by women or minority group members).

(k) Recipients shall maintain advances of Federal funds in interest bearing accounts, unless:

(1) The recipient receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year;

(2) The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not be expected to earn interest in excess of $250 per year on Federal cash balances; or

(3) The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would not be feasible within the expected Federal and non-Federal cash resources.

(l)(1) Interest earned on Federal advances deposited in interest bearing accounts shall be remitted annually to Department of Health and Human Services, Payment Management System, PO Box 6021, Rockville, MD 20852.

(2) In keeping with Electronic Funds Transfer rules (31 CFR part 206), interest should be remitted to the HHS Payment Management System through an electronic medium such as the FEDWIR Deposit System. Electronic remittances should be in the format and should include any data that are specified by the grants officer as being necessary to facilitate direct deposit in HHS' account at the Department of the Treasury.

(3) Recipients that do not have electronic remittance capability should use a check.

(4) Interest amounts up to $250 per year may be retained by the recipient for administrative expense.

(m) Except as noted elsewhere in this part, only the following forms shall be authorized for the recipients in requesting advances and reimbursements. DoD Components shall not require more than an original and two copies of these forms.

(1) SF-270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement. Each DoD Component shall adopt the SF-270 as a standard form for all nonconstruction programs when electronic funds transfer or predetermined advance methods are not used. DoD Components, however, have the option of using this form for construction programs in lieu of the SF-271,4 “Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs.”

4 See footnote 2 to § 32.12(a).

(2) SF-271, Outlay Report and Request for Reimbursement for Construction Programs. Each DoD Component shall adopt the SF-271 as the standard form to be used for requesting reimbursement for construction programs. However, a DoD Component may substitute the SF-270 when the DoD Component determines that it provides adequate information to meet Federal needs.
