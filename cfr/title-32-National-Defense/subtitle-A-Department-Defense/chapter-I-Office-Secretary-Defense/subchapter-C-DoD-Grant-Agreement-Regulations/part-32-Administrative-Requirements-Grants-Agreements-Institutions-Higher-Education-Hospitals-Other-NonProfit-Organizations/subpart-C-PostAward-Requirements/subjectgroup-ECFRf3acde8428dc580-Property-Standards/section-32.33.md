##### § 32.33 Federally-owned and exempt property. #####

(a) *Federally-owned property.* (1) Title to federally-owned property remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their custody to the DoD Component that made the award. Upon completion of the award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall report the property to the DoD Component for further Federal agency utilization.

(2) If the DoD Component that made the award has no further need for the property, it shall be declared excess and either:

(i) Reported to the General Services Administration, in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 483(b)(2)), as implemented by General Services Administration regulations at 41 CFR 101-47.202; or

(ii) Disposed of by alternative methods pursuant to other specific statutory authority. For example, DoD Components are authorized by the Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)), to donate research equipment to educational and non-profit organizations for the conduct of technical and scientific education and research activities - donations under this Act shall be in accordance with the DoD implementation of E.O. 12999 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 180), “Educational Technology: Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the Next Century,” as applicable. Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by the DoD Component.

(b) *Exempt property.* (1) When statutory authority exists, a DoD Component may vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under conditions the DoD Component considers appropriate. For example, under 31 U.S.C. 6306, DoD Components may so vest title to tangible personal property under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research in a nonprofit institution of higher education or a nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research. Such property is “exempt property.”

(2) As a matter of policy, DoD Components shall make maximum use of the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to exempt property in institutions of higher education, without further obligation to the Government, to enhance the university infrastructure for future performance of defense research and related, science and engineering education.

(3) DoD Components may establish conditions, in regulation or in award terms and conditions, for vesting title to exempt property. Should a DoD Component not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government.
