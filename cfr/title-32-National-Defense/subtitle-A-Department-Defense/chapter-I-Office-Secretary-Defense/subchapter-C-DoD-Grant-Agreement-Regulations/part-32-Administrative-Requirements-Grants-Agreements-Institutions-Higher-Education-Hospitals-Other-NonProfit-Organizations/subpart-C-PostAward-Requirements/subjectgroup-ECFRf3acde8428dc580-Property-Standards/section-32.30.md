##### § 32.30 Purpose of property standards. #####

Sections 32.31 through 32.37 set forth uniform standards governing management and disposition of property furnished by the Federal Government and property whose cost was charged to a project supported by a Federal award.

The recipient may use its own property management standards and procedures provided it observes the provisions of §§ 32.31 through 32.37.
