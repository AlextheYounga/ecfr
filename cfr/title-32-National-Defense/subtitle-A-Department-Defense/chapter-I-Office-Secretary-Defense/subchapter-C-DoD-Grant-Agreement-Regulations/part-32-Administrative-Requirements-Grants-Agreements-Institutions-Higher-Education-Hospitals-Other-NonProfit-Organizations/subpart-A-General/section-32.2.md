##### § 32.2 Definitions. #####

The following are definitions of terms used in this part. Grants officers are cautioned that terms may be defined differently in this part than they are in other parts of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations, because this part implements OMB Circular A-110 and uses definitions as stated in that Circular. In such cases, the definition given in this section applies to the term as it is used in this part, and the definition given in other parts applies to the term as it is used in those parts. For example, “suspension” is defined in this section to mean temporary withdrawal of Federal sponsorship under an award, but is defined in the part of the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations on nonprocurement suspension and debarment (2 CFR part 1125, which implements OMB guidance at 2 CFR part 180) to be an action taken to exclude a person from participating in a grant, cooperative agreement, or other covered transaction (see definition at 2 CFR 180.1015).

*Accrued expenditures.* The charges incurred by the recipient during a given period requiring the provision of funds for:

(1) Goods and other tangible property received;

*Accrued income.* The sum of:
