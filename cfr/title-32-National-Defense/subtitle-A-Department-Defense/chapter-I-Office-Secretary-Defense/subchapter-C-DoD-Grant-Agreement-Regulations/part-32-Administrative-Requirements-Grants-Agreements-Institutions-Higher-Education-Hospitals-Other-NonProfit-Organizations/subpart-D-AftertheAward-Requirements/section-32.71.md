##### § 32.71 Closeout procedures. #####

(a) Recipients shall submit, within 90 calendar days after the date of completion of the award, all financial, performance, and other reports required by the terms and conditions of the award. The grants officer may approve extensions when requested by the recipient.

(b) Unless the grants officer authorizes an extension, a recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in agency implementing instructions.

(c) The responsible grants officer and payment office shall expedite completion of steps needed to close out awards and make prompt, final payments to a recipient for allowable reimbursable costs under the award being closed out.

(d) The recipient shall promptly refund any balances of unobligated cash that the DoD Component has advanced or paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the recipient for use in other projects. OMB Circular A-12913 governs unreturned amounts that become delinquent debts (see 32 CFR 22.820).

13 See footnote 1 to § 32.1(a).

(e) When authorized by the terms and conditions of the award, the grants officer shall make a settlement for any upward or downward adjustments to the Federal share of costs after closeout reports are received.

(g) In the event a final audit has not been performed prior to the closeout of an award, the DoD Component shall retain the right to recover an appropriate amount after fully considering the recommendations on disallowed costs resulting from the final audit.
