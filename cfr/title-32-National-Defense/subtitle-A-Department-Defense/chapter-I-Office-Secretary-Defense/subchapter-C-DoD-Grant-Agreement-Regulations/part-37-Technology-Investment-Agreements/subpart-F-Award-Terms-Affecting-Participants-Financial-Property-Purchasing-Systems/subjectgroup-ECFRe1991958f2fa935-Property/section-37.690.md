##### § 37.690 How are nonprofit participants to manage real property and equipment? #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 51246, Aug. 19, 2020.

For nonprofit participants, your TIA's requirements for vesting of title, use, management, and disposition of real property or equipment acquired under the award are the same as those that apply to the participant's other Federal assistance awards. Specifically, the requirements are those in:

(a) 32 CFR 33.31 and 33.32, for participants that are States and local governmental organizations.

(b) 32 CFR 32.32 and 32.33, for other nonprofit participants, with the exception of nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs that are exempted from the definition of “recipient” in 32 CFR part 32. Although it should occur infrequently, if a nonprofit GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, you must specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with requirements in that participant's other Federal awards. Note also that:

(1) If the TIA is a cooperative agreement (see appendix B to this part), 31 U.S.C. 6306 provides authority to vest title to tangible personal property in a nonprofit institution of higher education or in a nonprofit organization whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research, without further obligation to the Federal Government; and

(2) Your TIA therefore must specify any conditions on the vesting of title to real property or equipment acquired by any such nonprofit participant, or the title will vest in the participant without further obligation to the Federal Government, as specified in 32 CFR 32.33(b)(3).
