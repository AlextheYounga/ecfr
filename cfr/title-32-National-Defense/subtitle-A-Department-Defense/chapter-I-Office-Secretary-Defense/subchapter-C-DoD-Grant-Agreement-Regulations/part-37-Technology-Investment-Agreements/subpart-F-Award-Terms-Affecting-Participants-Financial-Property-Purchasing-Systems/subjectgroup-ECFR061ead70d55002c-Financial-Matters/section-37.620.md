##### § 37.620 What financial management standards do I include for nonprofit participants? #####

So as not to force system changes for any State, local government, institution of higher education, or other nonprofit organization, your expenditure-based TIA's requirements for the financial management system of any nonprofit participant are the same as those that apply to the participant's other Federal assistance awards. Specifically, the requirements are those in:

(a) 32 CFR 33.20 for State and local governments; and

(b) 32 CFR 32.21(b) for other nonprofit organizations, with the exception of Government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) that are excepted from the definition of “recipient” in 32 CFR part 32. Although it should occur infrequently, if a nonprofit GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, you must specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with requirements in that participant's other Federal awards.
