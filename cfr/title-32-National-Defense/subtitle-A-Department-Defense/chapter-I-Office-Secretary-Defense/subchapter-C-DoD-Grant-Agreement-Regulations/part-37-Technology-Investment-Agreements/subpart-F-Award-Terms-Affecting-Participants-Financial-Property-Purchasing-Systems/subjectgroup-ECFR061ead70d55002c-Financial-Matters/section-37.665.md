##### § 37.665 Must I require nonprofit participants to have periodic audits? #####

Yes, expenditure-based TIAs are assistance instruments subject to the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-7507), so nonprofit participants are subject to their usual requirements under that Act and OMB Circular A-133.5 Specifically, the requirements are those in:

5*See* footnote 2 to § 37.635(a).

(a) 32 CFR 33.26 for State and local governments; and

(b) 32 CFR 32.26 for other nonprofit organizations. Note that those requirements also are appropriate for Government-owned, contractor-operated (GOCO) facilities and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) that are excluded from the definition of “recipient” in 32 CFR part 32, because nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs are subject to the Single Audit Act.
