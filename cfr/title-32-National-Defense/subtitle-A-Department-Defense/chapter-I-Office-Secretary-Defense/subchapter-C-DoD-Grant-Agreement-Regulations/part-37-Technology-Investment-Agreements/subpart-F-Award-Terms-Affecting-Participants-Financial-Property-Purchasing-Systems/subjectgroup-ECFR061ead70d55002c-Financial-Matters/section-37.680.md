Yes, your expenditure-based TIA must require participants to report to you when they enter into any subaward allowing a for-profit subawardee to use an IPA, as described in ยง 37.670(b)(2). You must provide that information about the new subaward under the TIA for your DoD Component's annual submission to the DTIC, even though the TIA may have been reported in a prior year and does not itself have to be reported again.
