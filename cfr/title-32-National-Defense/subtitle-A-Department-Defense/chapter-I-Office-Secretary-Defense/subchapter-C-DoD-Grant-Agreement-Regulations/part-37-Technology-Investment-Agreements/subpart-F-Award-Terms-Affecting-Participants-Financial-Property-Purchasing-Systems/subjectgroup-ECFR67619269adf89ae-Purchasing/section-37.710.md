##### § 37.710 What standards do I include for purchasing systems of nonprofit organizations? #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 51246, Aug. 19, 2020.

(a) So as not to force system changes for any nonprofit participant, your expenditure-based TIA will provide that each nonprofit participant's purchasing system comply with:

(1) 32 CFR 33.36, if the participant is a State or local governmental organization.

(2) 32 CFR 32.40 through 32.49 if the participant is a nonprofit organization other than a GOCO or FFRDC that is excepted from the definition of “recipient” in 32 CFR part 32. Although it should occur infrequently, if a nonprofit GOCO or FFRDC is a participant, you must specify appropriate standards that conform as much as practicable with requirements in that participant's other Federal awards.

(b) If your TIA is a fixed-support award, you need only require nonprofit participants to flow down the requirements listed in appendix E to this part.
