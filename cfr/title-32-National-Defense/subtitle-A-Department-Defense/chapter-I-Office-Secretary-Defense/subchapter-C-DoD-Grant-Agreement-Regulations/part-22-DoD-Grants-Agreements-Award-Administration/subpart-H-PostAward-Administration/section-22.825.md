Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 51244, Aug. 19, 2020.

(a) *Purpose.* This section establishes DoD policy for obtaining audits at closeout of individual grants and cooperative agreements. It thereby supplements the closeout procedures specified in:

(1) 32 CFR 32.71 and 32.72, for awards to institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations.

(b) *Policy.* Grants officers shall use their judgment on a case-by-case basis, in deciding whether to obtain an audit prior to closing out a grant or cooperative agreement (i.e., there is no specific DoD requirement to obtain an audit prior to doing so). Factors to be considered include:

(1) The amount of the award.

(2) DoD's past experience with the recipient, including the presence or lack of findings of material deficiencies in recent:

(i) Audits of individual awards; or

(ii) Systems-wide financial audits and audits of the compliance of the recipient's systems with Federal requirements, under OMB Circular A-133, where that Circular is applicable. (See ยง 22.715(a)(1)).
