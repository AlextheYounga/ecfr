##### § 21.300 What instruments are subject to the DoD Grant and Agreement Regulations (DoDGARs)? #####

(a) The types of instruments that are subject to the DoDGARs vary from one portion of the DoDGARs to another. The types of instruments include grants, cooperative agreements, and technology investment agreements. Some portions of the DoDGARs apply to other types of assistance or nonprocurement instruments. The term “awards,” as defined in subpart D of this part, is used in this part to refer collectively to all of the types of instruments that are subject to one or more portions of the DoDGARs.

(b) Note that each portion of the DoDGARs identifies the types of instruments to which it applies. However, grants officers and agreements officers must exercise caution when determining the applicability of some Governmentwide rules that are included within the DoDGARs, because a term may be defined differently in a Governmentwide rule than it is defined elsewhere in the DoDGARs. One example is part 33 of the DoDGARs (32 CFR part 33), which contains administrative requirements for awards to State and local governments. That DoDGARs part is the DoD's codification of the Governmentwide rule implementing OMB Circular A-102.3 Part 33 states that it applies to grants, but defines the term “grant” to include cooperative agreements and other forms of financial assistance.
