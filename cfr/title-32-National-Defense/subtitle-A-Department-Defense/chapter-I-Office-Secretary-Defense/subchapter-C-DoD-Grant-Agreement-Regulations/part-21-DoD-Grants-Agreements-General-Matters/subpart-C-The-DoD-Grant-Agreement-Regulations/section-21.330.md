##### ยง 21.330 How are the DoDGARs published and maintained? #####

(a) The DoD publishes the DoDGARs in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) and in a separate internal DoD document (DoD 3210.6-R).

(1) The location of the DoDGARs in the CFR currently is in transition. They are moving from Chapter I, Subchapter C, Title 32, to a new location in Chapter XI, Title 2 of the CFR. During the transition, there will be some parts of the DoDGARs in each of the two titles.

(2) The DoD document is divided into parts, subparts, and sections, to parallel the CFR publication. Cross references within the DoD document are stated as CFR citations (*e.g.*, a reference to section 21.215 in part 21 would be to 32 CFR 21.215), which also is how they are stated in the CFR publication of the DoDGARs.

(b) The DoD publishes updates to the DoDGARs in the Federal Register. When finalized, the DoD also posts the updates to the internal DoD document on the World Wide Web at *http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives.*

(c) A standing working group recommends revisions to the DoDGARs to the Director of Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&E). The DDR&E, Director of Defense Procurement, and each Military Department must be represented on the working group. Other DoD Components that make or administer awards may also nominate representatives. The working group meets when necessary.
