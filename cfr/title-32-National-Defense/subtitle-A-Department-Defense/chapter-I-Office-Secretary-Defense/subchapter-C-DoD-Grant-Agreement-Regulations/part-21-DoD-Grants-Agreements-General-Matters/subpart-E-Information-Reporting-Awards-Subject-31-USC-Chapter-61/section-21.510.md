##### ยง 21.510 Why does the DoD report information to the CFDA? #####

The Federal Program Information Act (31 U.S.C. 6101 through 6106), as implemented through OMB Circular A-89,4 requires the Department of Defense and other Federal agencies to provide certain information about their domestic assistance programs to the OMB and the General Services Administration (GSA). The GSA makes this information available to the public by publishing it in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) and maintaining the Federal Assistance Programs Retrieval System, a computerized data base of the information.
