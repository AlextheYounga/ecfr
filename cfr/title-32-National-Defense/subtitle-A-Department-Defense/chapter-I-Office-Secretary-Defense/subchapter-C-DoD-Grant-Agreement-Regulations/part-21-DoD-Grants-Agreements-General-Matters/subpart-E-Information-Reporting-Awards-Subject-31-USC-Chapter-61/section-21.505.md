The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) is a Governmentwide compilation of information about domestic assistance programs. It covers all domestic assistance programs and activities, regardless of the number of awards made under the program, the total dollar value of assistance provided, or the duration. In addition to programs using grants and agreements, covered programs include those providing assistance in other forms, such as payments in lieu of taxes or indirect assistance resulting from Federal operations.
