##### § 324.5 General information. #####

(a) The provisions of DoD 5400.11-R, ‘Department of Defense Privacy Program’ (see 32 CFR part 310) apply to all DFAS systems of records. DFAS Privacy Act Program Procedural Rules, DFAS Exemption Rules and System of Record Notices are the three types of documents relating to the Privacy Act Program that must be published in the Federal Register.

(b) A system of records used to retrieve records by a name or some other personal identifier of an individual must be under DFAS control for consideration under this regulation. DFAS will maintain only those Systems of Records that have been described through notices published in the Federal Register.

(1) *First amendment guarantee.* No records will be maintained that describe how individuals exercise their rights guaranteed by the First Amendment unless maintenance of the record is expressly authorized by Statute, the individual or for an authorized law enforcement purpose.

(2) *Conflicts.* In case of conflict, the provisions of DoD 5400.11-R take precedence over this supplement or any DFAS directive or procedure concerning the collection, maintenance, use or disclosure of information from individual records.

(3) *Record system notices.* Record system notices are published in the Federal Register as notices and are not subject to the rule making procedures. The public must be given 30 days to comment on any proposed routine uses prior to implementing the system of record.

(4) *Amendments.* Amendments to system notices are submitted in the same manner as the original notices.
