##### ยง 320.5 Disclosure of requested information. #####

(a) Upon request by an individual made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, such individual shall be granted access to any pertinent record which is contained in a nonexempt NGA system of records. However, nothing in this section shall allow an individual access to any information compiled by NGA in reasonable anticipation of a civil or criminal action or proceeding.

(b) Procedures for requests for access to records. Any individual may request access to a pertinent NGA record in person or by mail.

(1) Any individual making such request in person shall appear at Office of General Counsel, NGA Bethesda, ATTN: NGA/GC, Mail Stop D-10, 4600 Sangamore Road, Bethesda, MD 20816-5003, and shall provide identification to verify the individuals' identity, e.g., driver's license, employee identification card, or Medicare card.

(2) Any individual making a request for access to records by mail shall address such request to the Office of General Counsel, NGA Bethesda, ATTN: NGA/GC, Mail Stop D-10, 4600 Sangamore Road, Bethesda, MD 20816-5003; and shall include therein a signed, notarized statement, or an unsworn statement or declaration in accordance with 28 U.S.C. 1746, to verify identity.

(3) Any individual requesting access to records under this section in person may be accompanied by a person of the individual's own choosing while reviewing the record requested. If an individual elects to be so accompanied, said individual shall give notice of such election in the request and shall provide a written statement authorizing disclosure of the record in the presence of the accompanying person. Failure to so notify NGA in a request for access shall be deemed to be a decision by the individual not to be accompanied.

(c) NGA determination of requests for access.

(1) Upon receipt of a request made in accordance with this section, the NGA Office of General Counsel or NGA office having responsibility for maintenance of the record in question shall release the record, or refer it to an Initial Denial Authority, who shall:

(i) Determine whether such request shall be granted.

(ii) Make such determination and provide notification within 30 working days after receipt of such request.

(iii) Notify the individual that fees for reproducing copies of records will be assessed and should be remitted before the copies may be delivered. Fee schedule and rules for assessing fees are contained in ยง 320.9.

(iv) Requests for access to personal records may be denied only by an agency official authorized to act as an Initial Denial Authority or Final Denial Authority, after coordination with the Office of General Counsel.

(2) If access to a record is denied because such information has been compiled by NGA in reasonable anticipation of a civil or criminal action or proceeding, the individual will be notified of such determination and his right to judicial appeal under 5 U.S.C. 552a(g).

(d) Manner of providing access.

(1) If access is granted, the individual making the request shall notify NGA whether the records requested are to be copied and mailed.

(2) If the records are to be made available for personal inspection the individual shall arrange for a mutually agreeable time and place for inspection of the record. NIMA reserves the right to require the presence of a NIMA officer or employee during personal inspection of any record pursuant to this section and to request of the individual that a signed acknowledgment of the fact be provided that access to the record in question was granted by NIMA.
