##### ยง 312.4 Requirements for identification. #####

Only upon proper identification will any individual be granted access to records which pertain to him/her. Identification is required both for accurate record identification and to avoid disclosing records to unauthorized individuals. Requesters must provide their full name and as much information as possible about the record being sought in order that a proper search for records can be accomplished. Inclusion of a telephone number for the requester is recommended to expedite certain matters. Requesters applying in person must provide an identification with photograph, such as a driver's license, military identification card, building pass, etc.
