##### ยง 312.7 Request for correction or amendment. #####

(a) Requests to correct or amend a file shall be addressed to the system manager in which the file is located. The request must reasonably describe the record to be amended, the items to be changed as specifically as possible, the type of amendment (e.g., deletion, correction, amendment), and the reason for amendment. Reasons should address at least one of the following categories: Accuracy, relevance, timeliness, completeness, fairness. The request should also include appropriate evidence which provide a basis for evaluating the request. Normally all documents submitted, to include court orders, should be certified. Amendments under this part are limited to correcting factual matters and not matters of official judgment or opinions, such as performance ratings, promotion potential, and job performance appraisals.

(b) Requirements of identification as outlined in ยง 312.4 apply to requests to correct or amend a file.

(c) Incomplete requests shall not be honored, but the requester shall be contacted for the additional information needed to process the request.

(d) The amendment process is not intended to permit the alteration of evidence presented in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings. Any amendments or changes to these records normally are made through the specific procedures established for the amendment of such records.

(e) Nothing in the amendment process is intended or designed to permit a collateral attack upon what has already been the subject of a judicial or quasi-judicial determination. However, while the individual may not attack the accuracy of the judicial or quasi-judicial determination, he or she may challenge the accuracy of the recording of that action.
