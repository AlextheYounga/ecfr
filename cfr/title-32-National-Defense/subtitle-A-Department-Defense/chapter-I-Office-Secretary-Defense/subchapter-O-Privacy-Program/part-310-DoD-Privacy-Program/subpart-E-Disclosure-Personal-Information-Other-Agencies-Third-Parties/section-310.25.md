(2) In all other cases a disclosure accounting is required even if the individual has consented to the disclosure of the information.

(3) Disclosure accountings:

(i) Permit individuals to determine to whom information has been disclosed;

(2) A description of the information released.

(3) The purpose of the disclosure.

(4) The name and address of the person or Agency to whom the disclosure was made.

(c) *Methods of disclosure accounting.* Use any system of disclosure accounting that shall provide readily the necessary disclosure information (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section).

(d) *Accounting for mass disclosures.* When numerous similar records are released, identify the category of records disclosed and include the data required by paragraph (b) of this section in a form that can be used to construct an accounting disclosure record for individual records if required (see paragraph (a)(3) of this section).

(e) *Disposition of disclosure accounting records.* Retain disclosure accounting records for 5 years after the disclosure or the life of the record, whichever is longer.

(f) *Furnishing disclosure accountings to the individual.* (1) Make available to the individual to whom the record pertains all disclosure accountings except when:

(ii) The system of records has been exempted from the requirement to furnish the disclosure accounting under the provisions of § 310.26(b).

(2) If disclosure accountings are not maintained with the record and the individual requests access to the accounting, prepare a listing of all disclosures (see paragraph (b) of this section) and provide this to the individual upon request.
