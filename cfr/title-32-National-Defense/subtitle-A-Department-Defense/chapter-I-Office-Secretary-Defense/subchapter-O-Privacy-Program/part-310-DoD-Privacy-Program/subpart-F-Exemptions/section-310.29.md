##### § 310.29 Specific exemptions. #####

(a) *Use of specific exemptions.* The specific exemption established by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k) of the Privacy Act may be claimed to protect records that meet the following criteria (parenthetical references are to the appropriate subsection of the Act:

(1) *(k)(1).* Information subject to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1), (DoD 5200.1-R) (see also paragraph (c) of this section).

(2) *(k)(2).* Investigatory information compiled for law-enforcement purposes, other than information that is covered by the general exemption (see § 310.28). If an individual is denied any right, privilege or benefit he or she is otherwise entitled by Federal law or for which he or she would otherwise be eligible as a result of the maintenance of the information, the individual shall be provided access to the information except to the extent that disclosure would reveal the identity of a confidential source. This exemption provides limited protection of investigative reports maintained in a system of records used in personnel or administrative actions.

(i) The information must be compiled for some investigative law enforcement purpose, such as a criminal investigation by a DoD office, whose principal function is not law enforcement, or a civil investigation.

(ii) The exemption does not apply to investigations conducted solely for the purpose of a routine background investigation (see paragraph (a)(5) of this section), but will apply if the investigation is for the purpose of investigating DoD personnel who are suspected of violating statutory or regulatory authority.

(iii) The exemption can continue to be claimed even after the investigation has concluded and there is no future likelihood of further enforcement proceedings.

(3) *(k)(3).* Records maintained in connection with providing protective services to the President and other individuals under 18 U.S.C. 3056, “Powers, Authorities, and Duties of United States Secret Service.”

(4) *(k)(4).* Records maintained solely for statistical research or program evaluation purposes and that are not used to make decisions on the rights, benefits, or entitlement of an individual except for census records that may be disclosed under 13 U.S.C. 6, “Information for other Federal Departments and Agencies.

(5) *(k)(5).* Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the extent such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.

(i) This exemption permits protection of confidential sources used in background investigations, employment inquiries, and similar inquiries that are for personnel screening to determine suitability, eligibility, or qualifications.

(ii) This exemption is applicable not only to investigations conducted prior to the hiring of an employee, but it also applies to investigations conducted to determine continued employment suitability or eligibility.

(6) *(k)(6).* Testing or examination material used solely to determine individual qualifications for appointment or promotion in the Federal or military service, if the disclosure would compromise the objectivity or fairness of the test or examination process.

(7) *(k)(7).* Evaluation material used to determine potential for promotion in the Military Services, but only to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a confidential source.

(b) *Promises of confidentiality.* (1) Only the identity of sources that have been given an express promise of confidentiality may be protected from disclosure under paragraphs (a)(1), (5), and (7) of this section. However, the identity of sources who were given implied promises of confidentiality in inquiries conducted before September 27, 1975, also may be protected from disclosure.

(2) Ensure promises of confidentiality are not automatically given but are used sparingly. Establish appropriate procedures and identify fully categories of individuals who may make such promises. Promises of confidentiality shall be made only when they are essential to obtain the information sought (see 5 CFR part 736).

(c) *Access to records for which specific exemptions are claimed.* Deny the individual access only to those portions of the records for which the claimed exemption applies.
