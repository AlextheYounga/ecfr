##### ยง 326.13 Procedures to appeal denial of amendment. #####

(a) Any individual whose request for amendment or correction is denied may request a review of the initial decision within 60 calendar days of the date of the notification of denial by appealing within the NRO internal appeals process. If a requester elects to request NRO review, the request shall be sent in writing to the Privacy Act Coordinator, National Reconnaissance Office, 14675 Lee Road, Chantilly, VA 20151-1715, briefly identifying the particular record which is the subject of the request and setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The request should enclose a copy of the denial correspondence. The following procedures apply to appeals within the NRO:

(1) The PA Coordinator, after acknowledging receipt of the appeal, shall promptly refer the appeal to the record-holding components, informing them of the date of receipt of the appeal and requesting that the component head or his designee review the appeal.

(2) The record-holding components shall review the initial denial of access to the requested records and shall inform the PA Coordinator of their review determination.

(3) The PA Coordinator shall act as secretary of the Appeals Panel. He shall:

(i) Consolidate the component responses and reasons for the initial denial.

(ii) Provide all supporting materials both furnished to and by the requester and the record-holding component.

(iii) Review the record.

(iv) Direct such additional inquiry or investigation as is deemed necessary to make a fair and equitable determination.

(v) Prepare the record and schedule the appeal for the next meeting of the Appeals Panel. The Appeals Panel shall recommend a finding to the Appeal Authority by a majority vote of those present at the meeting based on the written record and the Panel's deliberations. No personal appearances shall be permitted without the express permission of the Panel.

(4) The Appeal Authority shall notify the PA Coordinator of the result of the determination on the appeal who shall notify the individual of the determination in writing.

(5) The Appeal Authority will notify the PA Coordinator if the determination is that the record should be amended. The PA Coordinator will promptly advise the requester and the office holding the record to amend the record and to notify all prior recipients of the records for which an accounting was required of the change.

(6) If the determination upholds the initial denial, in whole or in part, the PA Coordinator shall inform the requester:

(i) Of the denial and the reason.

(ii) Of his right to file in NRO records within 60 calendar days a concise statement of the reasons for disputing the information contained in the record. If the requester elects to file a statement of disagreement, the PA Coordinator will be responsible for clearly noting any portion of the record that is disputed and for appending into the file the requester's statement as well as a copy of the NRO's letter to the requester denying the disputed information, if appropriate. The requester's statement and the NRO denial letter will be made available to anyone to whom the record is subsequently disclosed, and prior recipients of the disputed record will be provided a copy of both to the extent that an accounting of disclosures is maintained.

(iii) Of his right to judicial review in U.S. District Court.

(7) The Appeal Authority shall act on the appeal or provide a notice of extension within 30 working days.
