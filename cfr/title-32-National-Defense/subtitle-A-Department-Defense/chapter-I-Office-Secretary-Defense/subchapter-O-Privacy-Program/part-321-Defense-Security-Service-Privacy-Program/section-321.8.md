##### § 321.8 DSS review of request for amendment. #####

(a) *General.* Upon receipt from any individual of a request to amend a record pertaining to himself and maintained by the Defense Security Service, Office of FOI and Privacy will handle the request as follows:

(1) A written acknowledgment of the receipt of a request for amendment of a record will be provided to the individual within 10 working days, unless final action regarding approval or denial can be accomplished within that time. In that case, the notification of approval or denial will constitute adequate acknowledgment.

(2) Where there is a determination to grant all or a portion of a request to amend a record, the record shall be promptly amended and the requesting individual notified. Individuals, agencies or components shown by accounting records to have received copies of the record, or to whom disclosure has been made, will be notified, if necessary, of the amendment by the responsible official. Where a DoD recipient of an investigative record cannot be located, the notification, if necessary, will be sent to the personnel security element of the parent Component.

(3) Where there is a determination to deny all or a portion of a request to amend a record, the office will promptly:

(i) Advise the requesting individual of the specifics of the refusal and the reasons;

(ii) Inform the individual that he may request a review of the denial(s) from ‘Director, Defense Security Service, 1340 Braddock Place, Alexandria, VA 22314-1651.’ The request should be brief, in writing, and enclose a copy of the denial correspondence.

(b) DSS determination to approve or deny. Determination to approve or deny and request to amend a record or portion thereof may necessitate additional investigation or inquiry be made to verify assertions of individuals requesting amendment. Coordination will be made with the Director for Investigations and the Director of the Personnel Investigations Center in such instances.
