##### ยง 144.6 Procedures. #####

The Secretaries of the Military Departments shall publish procedures that provide the following:

(a) When a Service member on active duty is summoned to perform State or local jury duty, the Secretary concerned, or the official to whom such authority has been delegated, shall decide if such jury duty would:

(1) Interfere unreasonably with the performance of the Service members military duties.

(2) Affect adversely the readiness of the unit, command, or activity to which the member is assigned.

(b) If such jury service would interfere with the Service member's military duties or adversely affect readiness, the Service member shall be exempted from jury duty. The decision of the Secretary concerned, or the official to whom such authority has been delegated, shall be conclusive.

(c) All general and flag officers, commanding officers, and all personnel assigned to the operating forces, in a training status, or stationed outside the United States are exempt from serving on a State or local jury. Such jury service necessarily would interfere unreasonably with the performance of military duties by these members and adversely affect the readiness of the unit, command, or activity to which they are assigned.

(d) Service members who serve on State or local juries shall not be charged leave or lose any pay or entitlements during the period of service. All fees accrued to members for jury service are payable to the U.S. Treasury. Members are entitled to any reimbursement from the State or local jury authority for expenses incurred in the performance of jury duty, such as for transportation costs or parking fees.

(e) Written notice of each exemption determination shall be provided to the responsible State or local official who summoned an exempt member for jury duty.
