|At least two staff members must be present with each group of children at all times. When one staff person is alone with a single ratio of children, the program director or designee frequently monitors the room through closed circuit television or visual access panels to ensure oversight by more than one adult. In this case, the staff member must have an initiated National Agency Check Investigation (NACI) and the program director or designee must have a completed NACI.|
