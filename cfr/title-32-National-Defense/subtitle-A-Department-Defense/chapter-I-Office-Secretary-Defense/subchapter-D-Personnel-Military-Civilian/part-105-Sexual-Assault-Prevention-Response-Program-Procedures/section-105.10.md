(3) Be trained in and understand the confidentiality requirements of Restricted Reporting and MRE 514. Training must include exceptions to Restricted Reporting and MRE 514.

(5) Be authorized by this part to accept reports of sexual assault along with the SAPR VA and healthcare personnel.

(6) Report directly to the installation commander in accordance with 32 CFR part 103, to include providing regular updates to the installation commander and assist the commander to meet annual SAPR training requirements, including providing orientation briefings for newly assigned personnel and, as appropriate, providing community education publicizing available SAPR services.

(7) Provide a 24 hour, 7 day per week response capability to victims of sexual assault, to include deployed areas.

(ii) Based on the locality, the SARC may ask the SAPR VA to respond and speak to the victim.

(A) There will be situations where a sexual assault victim receives medical care and a SAFE outside of a military installation under a MOU or MOA with local private or public sector entities. In these cases, pursuant to the MOU or MOA, the SARC or SAPR VA shall be notified, and a SARC or SAPR VA shall respond.

(B) When contacted by the SARC or SAPR VA, a sexual assault victim can elect not to speak to the SARC or SAPR VA, or the sexual assault victim may ask to schedule an appointment at a later time to speak to the SARC or SAPR VA.

(iii) SARCs shall provide a response that recognizes the high prevalence of pre-existing trauma (prior to the present sexual assault incident) and empowers an individual to make informed decisions about all aspects in the reporting process and to access available resources.

(iv) SARCs shall provide a response that is gender-responsive, culturally-competent, and recovery-oriented.

(v) SARCs shall offer appropriate referrals to sexual assault victims and facilitate access to referrals. Provide referrals at the request of the victim.

(8) Explain to the victim that the services of the SARC and SAPR VA are optional and these services may be declined, in whole or in part, at any time. The victim may decline advocacy services, even if the SARC or SAPR VA holds a position of higher rank or authority than the victim. Explain to victims the option of requesting a different SAPR VA (subject to availability, depending on locality staffing) or continuing without SAPR VA services.

(i) Explain the available reporting options to the victim.

(A) Assist the victim in filling out the DD Form 2910 where the victim elects to make a Restricted or Unrestricted Report. However, the victims, not the SARCs or SAPR VAs, must fill out the DD Form 2910. Explain that sexual assault victims have the right and ability to consult with a SVC/VLC before deciding whether to make a Restricted Report, Unrestricted Report, or no report at all. Additionally, the SARC or SAPR VA shall explain the eligibility requirements for an SVC/VLC, as well as the option to request SVC or VLC services even if the victim does not fall within the eligibility requirements.

(B) Inform the victim that the DD Form 2910 will be uploaded to DSAID and retained for 50 years in Unrestricted Reports. The DD Forms 2910 and 2911 filed in connection with the Restricted Report be retained for 50 years, in a manner that protects confidentiality.

(C) A SARC will open a case in DSAID as an โOpen with Limited Informationโ case when there is no signed DD 2910 (*e.g.,* an independent investigation or third-party report, or when a civilian victim alleged sexual assault with a Service member subject) to comply with section 563(d) of Public Law 110-417 and to ensure system accountability.

(xxiii) Provide information to assist installation commanders to manage trends and characteristics of sexual assault crimes at the Military Service-level and mitigate the risk factors that may be present within the associated environment (e.g., the necessity for better lighting in the showers or latrines and in the surrounding area).

(xxiv) Participate in the CMG to review individual cases of Unrestricted Reports of sexual assault.
