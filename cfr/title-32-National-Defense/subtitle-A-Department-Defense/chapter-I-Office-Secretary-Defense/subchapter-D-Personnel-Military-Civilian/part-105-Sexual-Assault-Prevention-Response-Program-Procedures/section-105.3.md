The SARC shall be notified, respond or direct a SAPR VA to respond, assign a SAPR VA, and offer the victim healthcare treatment and a SAFE. In geographic locations where there is no SARC onsite, the on-call SAPR VA shall respond, offer the victim healthcare treatment and a SAFE, and immediately notify the SARC of the sexual assault. The initial response is generally composed of personnel in the following disciplines or positions: SARCs, SAPR VAs, healthcare personnel, law enforcement, and MCIOs.

For DoD installations located in state jurisdictions with mandatory reporting laws requiring disclosure of PII of a sexual military assault victim (or their adult dependent) or alleged offender, to federal, local or state law enforcement agencies, such disclosure is not required unless disclosure of PII is necessary to prevent or mitigate a serious and imminent threat as provided for in this part. Additional persons who may be entitled to Restricted Reporting are NG and Reserve members. DoD civilians and contractors, at this time, are only eligible to file an Unrestricted Report. Only a SARC, SAPR VA, or healthcare personnel may receive a Restricted Report, previously referred to as Confidential Reporting.

*Re-victimization.* A pattern wherein the victim of abuse or crime has a statistically higher tendency to be victimized again, either shortly thereafter or much later in adulthood in the case of abuse as a child. This latter pattern is particularly notable in cases of sexual abuse.

(4) Does not replace local base and installation SARC or SAPR VA contact information.

*SAFE Kit.* Defined in 32 CFR part 103.

*Safety assessment.* A set of guidelines and considerations post-sexual assault that the responsible personnel designated by the Installation Commander can follow to determine if a sexual assault survivor is likely to be in imminent danger of physical or psychological harm as a result of being victimized by or reporting sexual assault(s). The guidelines and considerations consist of a sequence of questions, decisions, referrals, and actions that responders can enact to contribute to the safety of survivors during the first 72 hours of report, and during other events that can increase the lethality risk for survivors (*e.g.,* arrests or command actions against the alleged perpetrators). Types of imminent danger may include non-lethal, lethal, or potentially lethal behaviors; the potential harm caused by the alleged perpetrator, family/friend(s)/acquaintance(s) of the alleged perpetrator, or the survivors themselves). The safety assessment includes questions about multiple environments, to include home and the workplace. Survivors are also assessed for their perception or experience of potential danger from their leadership or peers via reprisal or ostracism. The safety assessment contains a safety plan component that survivors can complete and take with them to help improve coping, social support, and resource access during their recovery period.

*SAPR Integrated Product Team (IPT).* A team of individuals that advises the Under Secretary of Defense (USD) for Personnel and Readiness (P&R) and the Secretary of Defense on policies for sexual assault issues involving persons covered by this part.

*Service member.* Defined in 32 CFR part 103.

*Sexual assault.* Intentional sexual contact characterized by the use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or cannot consent.

*Trauma informed care.* An approach to engage people with histories of trauma that recognizes the presence of trauma symptoms and acknowledges the role that trauma has played in their lives.
