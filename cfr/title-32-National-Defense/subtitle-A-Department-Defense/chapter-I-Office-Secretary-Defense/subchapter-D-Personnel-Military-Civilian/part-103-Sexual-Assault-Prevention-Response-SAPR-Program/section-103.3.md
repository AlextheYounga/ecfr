Unless otherwise noted, these terms and their definitions are for the purpose of this part.

*Confidential communication.* Oral, written, or electronic communications of personally identifiable information concerning a sexual assault victim and the sexual assault incident provided by the victim to the SARC, SAPR VA, or healthcare personnel in a Restricted Report. This confidential communication includes the victim's sexual assault forensic examination (SAFE) Kit and its information. See *http://www.archives.gov/cui.*

*Consent.* A freely given agreement to the conduct at issue by a competent person. An expression of lack of consent through words or conduct means there is no consent. Lack of verbal or physical resistance or submission resulting from the use of force, threat of force, or placing another person in fear does not constitute consent. A current or previous dating or social or sexual relationship by itself or the manner of dress of the person involved with the accused in the conduct at issue shall not constitute consent. A sleeping, unconscious, or incompetent person cannot consent.

*Crisis intervention.* Emergency non-clinical care aimed at assisting victims in alleviating potential negative consequences by providing safety assessments and connecting victims to needed resources. Either the SARC or SAPR VA will intervene as quickly as possible to assess the victim's safety and determine the needs of victims and connect them to appropriate referrals, as needed.

*Culturally-competent care.* Care that provides culturally and linguistically appropriate services.

*DSAID.* A DoD database that captures uniform data provided by the Military Services and maintains all sexual assault data collected by the Military Services.

DSAID will include information when available, or when not limited by Restricted Reporting, or otherwise prohibited by law, about the nature of the assault, the victim, the offender, and the disposition of reports associated with the assault. DSAID shall be available to the Sexual Assault and Response Office and the DoD to develop and implement congressional reporting requirements. Unless authorized by law, or needed for internal DoD review or analysis, disclosure of data stored in DSAID will only be granted when disclosure is ordered by a military, Federal, or State judge or other officials or entities as required by a law or applicable U.S. international agreement. This term and its definition are proposed for inclusion in the next edition of Joint Publication 1-02.

*Emergency.* A situation that requires immediate intervention to prevent the loss of life, limb, sight, or body tissue to prevent undue suffering.

*Qualifying conviction.* A State or Federal conviction, or a finding of guilty in a juvenile adjudication, for a felony crime of sexual assault and any general or special court-martial conviction for a Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) offense, which otherwise meets the elements of a crime of sexual assault, even though not classified as a felony or misdemeanor within the UCMJ. In addition, any offense that requires registration as a sex offender is a qualifying conviction.

*Recovery-oriented care.* Focus on the victim and on doing what is necessary and appropriate to support victim recovery, and also, if a Service member, to support that Service member to be fully mission capable and engaged.

The victim's report provided to healthcare personnel (including the information acquired from a SAFE Kit), SARC's, or SAPR VAs at DoD installations will not be reported to law enforcement or to the command to initiate the official investigative process unless the victim consents to such reporting or an established exception applies in accordance with DoDI 6495.02 or as provided for in 32 CFR part 105.
