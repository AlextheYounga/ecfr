##### § 103.4 Policy. #####

It is DoD policy that:

(a) This part and DoDI 6495.02 implement the DoD SAPR policy.

(b) The DoD goal is a culture free of sexual assault by providing an environment of prevention, education and training, response capability (defined in DoDI 6495.02), victim support, reporting procedures, and accountability that enhances the safety and well being of all persons covered by this part and DoDI 6495.02.

(c) The SAPR Program shall:

(1) Focus on the victim and on doing what is necessary and appropriate to support victim recovery, and also, if a Service member, to support that Service member to be fully mission capable and engaged. The SAPR Program shall provide care that is gender-responsive, culturally-competent, and recovery-oriented. (See § 103.3 of this part)

(2) Not provide policy for legal processes within the responsibility of the Judge Advocates General of the Military Departments provided in Chapter 47 of Title 10, U.S.C. (also known as and hereafter referred to as “UCMJ”) and the Manual for Court's-Martial or for criminal investigative matters assigned to the Judge Advocates General of the Military Departments and IG, DoD.

(d) Standardized SAPR requirements, terminology, guidelines, protocols, and guidelines for instructional materials shall focus on awareness, prevention, and response at all levels as appropriate.

(e) The terms “Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC)” and “SAPR Victim Advocate (VA),” as defined in this part and the DoDI 6495.02, shall be used as standard terms throughout the DoD to facilitate communications and transparency regarding SAPR capacity. For further information regarding SARC and SAPR VA roles and responsibilities, see DoDI 6495.02.

(1) SARC. The SARC shall serve as the single point of contact for coordinating appropriate and responsive care for sexual assault victims. SARCs shall coordinate sexual assault victim care and sexual assault response when a sexual assault is reported. The SARC shall supervise SAPR VAs, but may be called on to perform victim advocacy duties.

(2) SAPR VA. The SAPR VA shall provide non-clinical crisis intervention and on-going support, in addition to referrals for adult sexual assault victims. Support will include providing information on available options and resources to victims.

(f) Command sexual assault awareness and prevention programs, as well as law enforcement and criminal justice procedures that enable persons to be held accountable for their actions, as appropriate, shall be established and supported by all commanders.

(g) An immediate, trained sexual assault response capability (defined in DoDI 6495.02) shall be available for each report of sexual assault in all locations, including in deployed locations. The response time may be affected by operational necessities, but will reflect that sexual assault victims shall be treated as emergency cases.

(h) Victims of sexual assault shall be protected from coercion, retaliation, and reprisal in accordance with DoDD 7050.06.

(i) Victims of sexual assault shall be protected, treated with dignity and respect, and shall receive timely access to comprehensive healthcare (medical and mental health) treatment, including emergency care treatment and services, as described in this part and DoDI 6495.02.

(j) Emergency care shall consist of emergency health care and the offer of a SAFE consistent with the “A National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations, Adults/Adolescents” and refer to DD Form 2911, “DoD Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examination Report” and accompanying instructions. The victim shall be advised that even if a SAFE is declined, the victim is encouraged (but not mandated) to receive medical care, psychological care, and victim advocacy.

(1) Sexual assault patients shall be given priority, so that they shall be treated as emergency cases. A sexual assault victim needs immediate medical intervention to prevent loss of life or suffering resulting from physical injuries (internal or external), sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, and psychological distress. Individuals disclosing a recent sexual assault shall, with their consent, be quickly transported to the exam site, promptly evaluated, treated for serious injuries, and then, with the patient's consent, undergo a SAFE, pursuant to “Victim Centered Care” of “A National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations, Adults/Adolescents” and refer to DD Form 2911 and accompanying instructions.

(2) Sexual assault patients shall be treated as emergency cases, regardless of whether physical injuries are evident. Patients' needs shall be assessed for immediate medical or mental health intervention pursuant to “Victim Centered Care,” and “Triage and Intake” of “A National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations, Adults/Adolescents.” Sexual assault victims shall be treated uniformly, consistent with “Victim Centered Care” of “A National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations, Adults/Adolescents” and DD Form 2911 and accompanying instructions, regardless of their behavior because when severely traumatized, sexual assault patients may appear to be calm, indifferent, submissive, jocular, angry, emotionally distraught, or even uncooperative or hostile towards those who are trying to help.

(k) Service members and their dependents who are 18 years of age or older covered by this part (see § 103.2(d)) and DoDI 6495.02 who are sexually assaulted have two reporting options: Unrestricted or Restricted Reporting. Unrestricted Reporting of sexual assault is favored by the DoD. See DoDI 6495.02 for additional information on the DoD sexual assault reporting options and exceptions as they apply to Restricted Reporting. Consult DoDD 5400.11 and DoD 6025.18-R for protections of personally identifiable information solicited, collected, maintained, accessed, used, disclosed, and disposed during the treatment and reporting processes. The two reporting options are as follows:

(1) Unrestricted Reporting allows an eligible person who is sexually assaulted to access healthcare and counseling and request an official investigation of the allegation using existing reporting channels (e.g., chain of command, law enforcement, healthcare personnel, the SARC). When a sexual assault is reported through Unrestricted Reporting, a SARC shall be notified as soon as possible, respond, assign a SAPR VA, and offer the victim health care and a SAFE.

(2) Restricted Reporting allows sexual assault victims (see eligibility criteria in § 103.2(c) of this part) to confidentially disclose the assault to specified individuals (i.e., SARC, SAPR VA, or healthcare personnel), in accordance with DoDD 5400.11, and receive healthcare treatment, including emergency care, counseling, and assignment of a SARC and SAPR VA, without triggering an official investigation. The victim's report to healthcare personnel (including the information acquired from a SAFE Kit), SARCs, or SAPR VAs will not be reported to law enforcement or to the victim's command, to initiate the official investigative process, unless the victim consents or an established exception applies in accordance with DoDI 6495.02, state laws, or federal regulations. When a sexual assault is reported through Restricted Reporting, a SARC shall be notified as soon as possible, respond, assign a SAPR VA, and offer the victim healthcare and a SAFE.

(i) Eligibility for Restricted Reporting. The Restricted Reporting option applies to Service Members and their military dependents 18 years of age and older. For additional persons who may be entitled to Restricted Reporting, see eligibility criteria in DoDI 6495.02.

(ii) DoD Dual Objectives. The DoD is committed to ensuring victims of sexual assault are protected; treated with dignity and respect; and provided support, advocacy, and care. The DoD supports effective command awareness and preventive programs. The DoD also strongly supports applicable law enforcement and criminal justice procedures that enable persons to be held accountable for sexual assault offenses and criminal dispositions, as appropriate. To achieve these dual objectives, DoD preference is for Unrestricted Reporting of sexual assaults to allow for the provision of victims' services and to pursue accountability. However, Unrestricted Reporting may represent a barrier for victims to access services, when the victim desires no command or law enforcement involvement. Consequently, the Department recognizes a fundamental need to provide a confidential disclosure vehicle via the Restricted Reporting option.

(iii) Designated Personnel Authorized to Accept a Restricted Report. Only the SARC, SAPR VA, or healthcare personnel are designated as authorized to accept a Restricted Report.

(iv) SAFE Confidentiality Under Restricted Reporting. A SAFE and its information shall be afforded the same confidentiality as is afforded victim statements under the Restricted Reporting option. See DoDI 6495.02 for additional information.

(v) Disclosure of Confidential Communications. In cases where a victim elects Restricted Reporting, the SARC, assigned SAPR VA, and healthcare personnel may not disclose confidential communications or SAFE Kit information to law enforcement or command authorities, either within or outside the DoD, except as provided in DoDI 6495.02. In certain situations when information about a sexual assault comes to the commander's or law enforcement official's attention from a source independent of the Restricted Reporting avenues and an independent investigation is initiated, a SARC, SAPR VA, or healthcare personnel may not disclose confidential communications if obtained under Restricted Reporting (see exceptions to Restricted Reporting in DoDI 6495.02).
Improper disclosure of confidential communications protected under Restricted Reporting, improper release of healthcare information, and other violations of this policy or other laws and regulations are prohibited and may result in discipline pursuant to the UCMJ, or other adverse personnel or administrative actions.

(l) Enlistment or commissioning of personnel in the Military Services shall be prohibited and no waivers allowed when the person has a qualifying conviction (see § 103.3) for a crime of sexual assault.

(m) The focus of this part and DoDI 6495.02 is on the victim of sexual assault. The DoD shall provide support to an active duty Service member regardless of when or where the sexual assault took place.

(n) Victims must be informed of the availability of legal assistance and the right to consult with a Special Victims' Counsel (SVC)/Victims' Legal Counsel (VLC) in accordance with section 1716 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Pub. L. 113-66).
