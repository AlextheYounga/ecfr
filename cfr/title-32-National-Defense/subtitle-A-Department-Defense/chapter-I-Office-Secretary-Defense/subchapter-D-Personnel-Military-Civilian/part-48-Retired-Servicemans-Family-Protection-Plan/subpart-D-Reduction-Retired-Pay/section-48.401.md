##### § 48.401 Computation of reduction. #####

(a) The reduction to be made in the retired pay of a member who has made an election shall be computed by the uniformed service concerned in each individual case, based upon tables of factors prepared by the Board of Actuaries. The computation shall be based upon the applicable table in effect on the date of retirement.

(b) An adjustment may be made in the reduction of retired pay upon the finding of an administrative error or a mistake of fact (see § 48.603).

(c) If a member elects to be covered by option 3, and on the date he is awarded retired pay has no children eligible to receive the annuity, or has only a child or children aged 18-22 (other than a child described in § 48.102(e)(4) and elects, at retirement, that such child or children shall not be considered to be eligible beneficiaries, he shall have his costs computed as though he had elected option 1. If he elects option 3, and on the date he is awarded retired pay has no wife eligible for the annuity, he shall have his costs computed as though he had elected option 2.

(d) If a member elects option 3, and after he becomes entitled to retired pay, there is no eligible spouse because of death or divorce, upon the retired member's application, no deductions from his retired pay shall be made after the last day of the month in which there ceases to be an eligible spouse. Children otherwise eligible will continue to be eligible for the annuity in event of the member's death. No amounts by which the member's retired pay is reduced before that date may be refunded to or credited on behalf of that person.

(e) The amount of reduction in retired pay and the annuity payable established for each individual at the time of his retirement shall remain unaltered except as provided in § 48.203(g), paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, and § 48.406, regardless of future pay increases or decreases.
