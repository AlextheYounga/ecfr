##### ยง 48.204 Change or revocation of election. #####

(a) A change of election is a change in the amount of the annuity or annuities under any option, or a change in any option or options selected. A revocation is a cancellation of a previous election and constitutes a withdrawal from coverage under the Plan.

(b) A member may change or revoke his election as often as he desires prior to the completion of 19 years of service. Such a change or revocation must be dated, signed, witnessed, and delivered to appropriate service officials, or postmarked not later than midnight on the day in which the member completes 19 years of service. The latest election, change, or revocation which is submitted in accordance with this subsection will be effective at retirement.

(c) A member who desires to make an election or change or revoke his election after he has completed 19 years of service may do so prior to his retirement. However, such an election, change or revocation will be effective only if at least 2 years elapse between the date of the election, change, or revocation and the date of eligibility to receive retired pay.

(d) A revocation will not prohibit the filing of a new election at a later date which will become valid under applicable validation provisions.

(f) Notification of a change in family status is not a change of election.

(g) All changes and revocations on file on August 13, 1968, for members not entitled to retired pay shall be subject to the provisions of this section unless the member makes the application specified in ยง 48.604(d).
