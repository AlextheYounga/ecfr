##### ยง 48.507 Restriction on participation. #####

(a) If a person who has made an election under the Plan retires with a physical disability before the completion of 19 years of service and then dies in retirement, his widow and eligible children can receive monthly survivor annuities only if they are not eligible for Dependency and Indemnity Compensation payments from the Veterans Administration. If either the widow or children are eligible for dependency and indemnity compensation payments, then payment of annuities under the Plan may not be made to any member of the family. If the retired member's death was not service connected and his widow or children are not eligible for payments from the Veterans Administration, they may receive the provided annuity payments under the Plan.

(b) If the beneficiaries on whose behalf the election was made are restricted as in paragraph (a) of this section, from receiving annuities, the amounts withheld from the elector's retired pay as a result of the election will be refunded to the beneficiaries, less the amount of any annuity paid, and without interest.

(c) Upon notification of the death of the member in such a case, the department concerned will take the following actions:

(1) Notify the Central Office of the Veterans Administration of the death of the member and request that the department concerned be advised if an award is made under chapter 11 or 13, title 38 U.S. Code.

(2) Request the Central Office of the Veterans Administration to forward to the eligible widow and/or children an application form for survivor benefits under chapter 11 or 13, title 38 U.S. Code, with instructions for completion and submission.
