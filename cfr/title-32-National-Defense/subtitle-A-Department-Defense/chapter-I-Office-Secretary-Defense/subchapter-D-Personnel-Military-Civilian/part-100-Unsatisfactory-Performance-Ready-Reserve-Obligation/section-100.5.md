(b) *Exceptions.* As exceptions to the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section, members of the Ready Reserve who do not or are unable to participate for any of the following reasons shall be processed as indicated:

(1) Members of the Selected Reserve who are unable to participate in a unit of the Selected Reserve by reason of an action taken by the Military Department concerned, such as unit inactivation or relocation, to the effect that they now reside beyond a reasonable commuting distance (as defined in § 100.6(e)) of a Reserve unit, shall be assigned to the IRR until they are able to join or be assigned to another unit, or complete their statutory military service obligation.

(2) Members of the Selected Reserve who change their residence:

(i) May lose their unit position. However, they will be transferred to another paid-drill unit with the same Reserve component if possible or be given 90 days after departing from their original unit to locate and join another unit.

(A) The losing unit certifies that the reservist's performance of service has been satisfactory.

(10) Nothing in this part shall be construed as precluding action against a member of the Ready Reserve, either by court-martial or review by a board of officers convened by an authority designated by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, when such action might otherwise be warranted under 10 U.S.C. 268(b), 270, 510, 511, 593, 597, 651, 652, 672, 673, 673a, 673b, 685, and 1163 and the regulations of the Military Department concerned.
