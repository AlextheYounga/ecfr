(b) *Assistive technology service.* Any service that directly assists an individual with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device. This term includes:

(1) Evaluating the needs of an individual with a disability, including a functional evaluation of the individual in the individual's customary environment.

(2) Purchasing, leasing, or otherwise providing for the acquisition of assistive technology devices by individuals with disabilities.

(3) Selecting designing, fitting, customizing, adapting, applying, maintaining, repairing, or replacing of assistive technology devices.

(4) Coordinating and using other therapies, interventions, or services with assistive technology devices, such as those associated with existing educational and rehabilitative plans and programs.

(c) *Attention deficit disorder (ADD).* As used to define students, encompasses attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and attention deficit disorder without hyperactivity. The essential features of this disorder are developmentally inappropriate degrees of inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity.

(1) A diagnosis of ADD may be made only after the child is evaluated by appropriate medical personnel, and evaluation procedures set forth in this part (appendix B to this part) are followed.

(2) A diagnosis of ADD, in and of itself, does not mean that a child requires special education; it is possible that a child diagnosed with ADD, as the only finding, can have his or her educational needs met within the regular education setting.

(3) For a child with ADD to be eligible for special education, the Case Study Committee, with assistance from the medical personnel conducting the evaluation, must then make a determination that the ADD is a chronic or acute health problem that results in limited alertness, which adversely affects educational performance. Children with ADD who are eligible for special education and medically related services will qualify for services under “Other Health Impaired” as described in Criterion A, paragraph (h)(1) of this section.

(d) *Autism.* A developmental disability significantly affecting verbal and non-verbal communication and social interaction generally evident before age 3 that adversely affects educational performance. Characteristics of autism include irregularities and impairments in communication, engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences. The term does not include children with characteristics of the disability of serious emotional disturbance.

(e) *Case Study Committee (CSC).* A school-based committee that determines a child's eligibility for special education, develops and reviews a child's individualized education program (IEP), and determines appropriate placement in the least restrictive environment.

(1) The designated representative of the Section 6 School Arrangement, who is qualified to supervise the provision of special education. Such representative may not be the child's special education teacher.

(2) One, or more, of the child's regular education teachers, if appropriate.

(3) A special education teacher.

(4) One, or both, of the child's parents.

(5) The child, if appropriate.
