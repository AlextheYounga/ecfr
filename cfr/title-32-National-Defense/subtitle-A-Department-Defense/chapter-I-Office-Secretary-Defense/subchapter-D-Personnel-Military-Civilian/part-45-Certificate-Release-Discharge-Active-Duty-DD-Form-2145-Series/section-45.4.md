##### § 45.4 Responsibilities. #####

(a) The DD Forms 214 and 215 are a source of significant and authoritative information used by civilian and governmental agencies to validate veteran eligibility for benefits. As such, they are valuable forms and, therefore, vulnerable to fraudulent use. Since they are sensitive, the forms must be safeguarded at all times. They will be transmitted, stored, and destroyed in a manner which will prevent unauthorized use. The Military Services will issue instructions consistent with the following:

(1) All DD Forms 214 will be surprinted with a reproducible screen tint using appropriate security ink on Blocks 1, 3, 4.a, 4.b, 12, and 18 through 30. In addition Blocks 1, 3, 5, and 7 of the DD Form 215 will be similarly surprinted to make alterations readily discernible. No corrections will be permitted in the screened areas.

(2) All forms will be secured after duty hours.

(3) All obsolete forms will be destroyed.

(4) All forms to be discarded, including those which are blank or partially completed, and reproduced copies of DD Form 214, will be destroyed. No forms will be discarded intact.

(5) Blank forms given to personnel for educational or instructional purposes, and forms maintained for such use, are to be clearly voided in an unalterable manner.

(6) The commander or commanding officer of each unit or activity authorized to issue DD Form 214 will appoint, in writing, a commissioned officer, warrant officer, enlisted member (grade E-7 or above), or DoD civilian (GS-7 or above) who will requisition, control, and issue blank DD Forms 214 and 215. The Service concerned may authorize an E-5 or GS-5 to serve in this capacity.

(7) The Military Services will monitor the use of DD Form 214 and review periodically its issuance to insure compliance with procedures for safeguarding.

(b) The DD Form 214-ws will contain the word “WORKSHEET” on the body of the form (see Appendix B). This DD Form 214-ws will be treated in the same manner as the DD Form 214.

(c) The Military Services will issue appropriate instructions to separation activities stressing the importance of the DD Forms 214 and 215 in obtaining veterans benefits, reemployment rights, and unemployment insurance.

(d) Standard separation program designator (SPD) codes for officer and enlisted personnel developed under the provisions of DoD Instruction 5000.123 are published in DoD 5000.12-M.

3 See footnote 1 to § 45.3(d)(6).

(1) Requests to add, change, or delete an SPD code shall be forwarded by the DoD Component concerned with appropriate justification to the Assigned Responsible Agency accountable for evaluating, recommending approval of, and maintaining such codes: Department of the Navy, Office of The Chief of Naval Operations, (Attention: OP-161), room 1514, Arlington Annex, Washington, DC 20350-2000.

(2) Requests to add, change, or delete an SPD code will be submitted in accordance with section V., DoD Instruction 5000.12 with prior written approval by the ASD (FM&P), or his/her designee.

(e) All lists of SPD codes, including supplemental lists, published by the DoD Components will be stamped “For Official Use Only” and will not be furnished to any agency or individual outside the Department of Defense.

(1) Appropriate provisions of the Freedom of Information Act will be used to deny the release of the lists to the public. An individual being separated or discharged is entitled access only to his/her SPD code. It is not intended that these codes stigmatize an individual in any manner. They are intended for internal use by the Department of Defense in collecting data to analyze statistical reporting trends that may, in turn, influence changes in separation policy.

(2) Agencies or individuals who come into the possession of these lists are cautioned on their use because a particular list may be outdated and not reveal correctly the full circumstances relating to an individual's separation or discharge.
