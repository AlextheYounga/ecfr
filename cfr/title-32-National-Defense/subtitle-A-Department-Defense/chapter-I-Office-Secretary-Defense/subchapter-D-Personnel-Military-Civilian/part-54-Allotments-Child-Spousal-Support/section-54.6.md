(4) When the notice does not sufficiently identify the member, it shall be returned directly to the authorized person with an explanation of the deficiency. However, before the notice is returned, if there is sufficient time, an attempt shall be made to inform the authorized person who sent the notice that it will not be honored unless adequate information is supplied.

(5) Upon receipt of effective notice of delinquent support payments, together with all required supplementary documents and information, the designated official shall identify the member from whom moneys are due and payable. Under ยง 54.6(d), the allotment shall be established in the amount necessary to comply with the support order and to liquidate arrearages if provided by a support order when the maximum amount to be allotted under this provision, together with any other moneys withheld for support from the member, does not exceed:

When the member submits evidence, copies shall be sent to the authorized person, together with notification that the member's support claim shall be honored. If the support claim is contested by the authorized person, that authorized person may refer this matter to the appropriate court or other authority for resolution.

(ii) Sixty percent of the member's disposable earnings for any month in which the member fails to assert by affidavit or other acceptable evidence that he or she is supporting a spouse, dependent child, or both.

(iii) Regardless of the limitations above, an additional 5 percent of the member's disposable earnings shall be withheld when the notice states that the total amount of the member's support payments is 12 or more weeks in arrears.

(e) *Payments.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) the Secretary of the Military Department concerned, or designee, shall make the support allotment by the first end-of-month payday after the designated official is notified that the member has had a consultation with a judge advocate or legal officer, or that a consultation was not possible, but not later than the first end-of-month payday after 30 days have elapsed from the date of the notice to the member. The Military Services will not be required to vary their normal military allotment payment cycle to comply with the notice.

(2) If several notices are sent with respect to the same member, payments shall be satisfied on a first-come, first-served basis within the amount limitations in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

(3) When the member identified in the notice is found not to be entitled to money due from or payable by the Military Service, the designated official shall return the notice to the authorized person and shall advise him or her that no money is due from or payable by the Military Service to the named individual. When it appears that amounts are exhausted temporarily or otherwise unavailable, the authorized person shall be told why, and for how long, any money is unavailable, if known. If the member separates from active duty, the authorized person shall be informed that the allotment is discontinued.

(4) Payment of statutorily required allotments shall be enforced over other voluntary deductions and allotments when the gross amount of pay and allowances is not sufficient to permit all authorized deductions and collections.
