(a) Those whose backgrounds pose serious questions as to fitness for service (10 U.S.C. 504 and 505) or suitability for participation in special programs (part 156 of this title).

(b) Those who may not be enlisted in the Military Services unless a waiver is granted (section 504 of title 10, United States Code).

(c) Those who may try to enlist fraudulently.
