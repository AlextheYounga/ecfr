##### ยง 65.6 Procedures. #####

(a) *General eligibility.* Eligibility and administration of the Post-9/11 GI Bill are the responsibility of the VA. Policies and procedures for utilization of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are available from that agency. Those policies and procedures are codified in 38 CFR part 21 and presented and updated at *http://www.gibill.va.gov.*

(b) *Kickers* - (1) *Enlistment kickers.* The use of enlistment kickers should be based on the criticality of the skill or the length of enlistment commitment and may be offered in amounts from $150 to $950 a month in increments of $100. Reporting codes for enlistment kickers are listed in DoD Instruction 1336.05 and DoD Manual 7730.54-M-V1.

(2) *Affiliation kickers.* The use of affiliation kickers shall be based on the criticality of the skill and/or unit and the length of Selected Reserve commitment, and may be offered in amounts from $150 to $950 a month in increments of $100. If an individual is already eligible for an enlistment kicker, the amount of the affiliation kicker is limited to the amount that would take the total to $950. For those individuals who are offered an affiliation kicker on top of an enlistment kicker, the increases above the enlistment kicker will be in $100 increments. Reporting codes for affiliation kickers are the same as the codes for enlistment kickers listed in DoD Instruction 1336.05 and DoD Manual 7730.54-M-V1.

(3) *Reenlistment kickers.* The use of reenlistment kickers should be based on the criticality of the skill and may be offered in amounts from $100 to $300 a month in increments of $100, based on length of additional service. Reporting codes for reenlistment kickers are listed in DoD Instruction 1336.05 and DoD Manual 7730.54-M-V1.

(4) *Payment of kickers.* Kickers are paid by VA in conjunction with the monthly stipend paid pursuant to 38 U.S.C. 3313(c).

(c) *Transferability of unused education benefits to family members.* Subject to the provisions of this section, the Secretary Concerned, to promote recruitment and retention in the Uniformed Services, may permit an individual eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill educational assistance to elect to transfer to one or more of his or her family members all or a portion of his or her entitlement to such assistance (see paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section).

(ii) Paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section shall not apply to an individual who fails to complete service agreement due to:

(A) His or her death.

(B) Discharge or release from active duty or the Selected Reserve for a medical condition that pre-existed his or her service and was not service-connected.

(C) Discharge or release from active duty or the Selected Reserve for hardship as determined by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned.
