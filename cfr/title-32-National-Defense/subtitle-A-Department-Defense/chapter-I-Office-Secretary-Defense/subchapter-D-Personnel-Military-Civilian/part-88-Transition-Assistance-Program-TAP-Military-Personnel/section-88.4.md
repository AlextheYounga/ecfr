(a) The TAP:

(1) Prepares all eligible members of the Military Services for a transition from Active Duty back to civilian life.

(2) Enables eligible Service members to fulfill the requirements of the VOW to Hire Heroes Act and meet CRS as required by this part.

(3) Is the overarching program that provides transition assistance, information, training, and services to eligible transitioning Service members to prepare them to be career ready when they separate, retire, or are released from active duty back to civilian life. The TAP consists of multiple elements, including: The Transition GPS curricula, the components of which are outlined in appendix E to part 88; policy and procedures; information technology (IT) infrastructure; research, studies and survey data; performance measures and outcomes; assessments; curricula development in both brick and mortar and virtual settings and modifications; CRS; accountability data; and resources required to implement transition assistance.

(b) Components are integrated throughout the eligible Service member's Military Life Cycle (MLC) TAP at key touch points. The Transition GPS component of TAP consists of curriculum, counseling, information, referral, and deliverables to enable eligible Service members to meet the CRS.

(c) This policy establishes a TAP interagency governance structure according to DoD Instruction 5105.18, “DoD Intergovernmental and Intragovernmental Committee Management Program” (available at *http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/510518p.pdf*), referred to in this part as the TAP EC and SSG. DoD will support and carry out the DoD mission of the governance structure as set out in the Interagency Statement of Intent, dated August 15, 2013, “Transition Assistance for Separating Service Members.” The EC will designate working groups as appropriate. DoD representation to working groups will be in accordance with § 88.5 of this part.
