##### § 77.3 Definitions. #####

(a) *Community service employment.* Work in nonprofit organizations that provide or coordinate services listed in paragraphs (d) (1) through (12) of this section. “Nonprofit” is defined as having been recognized by the Internal Revenue Service as having a tax-exempt status under 26 U.S.C. 501 (c)(3) or (c)(4). These organizations shall not be administered by businesses organized for profit, labor unions, partisan political organizations, or organizations engaged in religious activities, unless such activities are unrelated to religious instructions, worship services, or any form of proselytization.

(b) *Creditable early retirement public or community service employment for service members.* Employment in a DoD-registered public and community service organization that provides the services listed in paragraphs (d) (1) through (12) of this section, or that coordinates the provision of the services listed in paragraphs (d) (1) through (12) of this section. Federal employment shall count toward recomputed military retirement pay and Survivor Benefit Plan base amount for early retirees: however, working in a DoD-registered Federal public service organization may trigger the dual-compensation restrictions of 5 U.S.C. 5532. Employment must have occurred between that date of early retirement and the date in which the Service member would have attained 20 years of credible service for computing retired pay, or he or she must have retired on or after October 23, 1992 and before October 1, 1999.
