##### ยง 584.9 Involuntary allotments. #####

(a) *General.* Pub. L. 97-248 (42 U.S.C. 665) permits involuntary allotments from pay and allowances of soldiers on active duty as child, or child and spousal, support payments when -

(1) The soldier has failed to make payments under a court order for 2 months or in a total amount equal to or in excess of the support obligations for 2 months.

(2) Failure to make such payments is established by notice from an authorized person to the Commander, USAFAC, ATTN: FINCL-G, Indianapolis, IN 46249-0160. An authorized person is -

(i) Any agent or attorney of any State having in effect a plan approved under part D of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651-664), who has the duty or authority under the plan to seek recovery of any amounts owed as child or child and spousal support (including, when authorized under a State plan, any official of a political subdivision).

(ii) A court or agent of the court that has authority to issue an order against the soldier for the support and maintenance of a child.

(3) Such notice must give the soldier's full name and SSN. Also, it must list the name and address of the person to whom the allotment is payable. The amount of the allotment will be the amount needed to comply with the support order. The allotment may include arrearages as well as amounts for current support if provided for in the support order. A copy of this must be included with the notice. If proper, a statement must be included that the support allotment qualifies for the additional 5 percent in excess of the maximum percentage limitations. These limitations are prescribed in 15 U.S.C. 1673. Also, a copy of the underlying support order must be included with the notice. An allotment under this provision will be adjusted or discontinued only upon notice from an authorized person.

(b) *Procedures.* No action will be taken to set up an allotment until the soldier has the chance to consult a legal assistance attorney. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect to the soldier's support obligation and failure to make payments. If the soldier has not consulted with legal counsel, the allotment will start the first end-of-month payday after 30 days have elapsed since notice was given to the affected soldier.
