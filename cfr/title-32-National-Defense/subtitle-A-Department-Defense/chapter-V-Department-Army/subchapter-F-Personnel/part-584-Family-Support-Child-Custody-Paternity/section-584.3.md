##### § 584.3 Paternity claims. #####

(a) *General.* (1) This chapter sets policy and procedures to process paternity claims against male Army soldiers. These procedures apply to claims made in the continental United States and in foreign countries. They apply to claims made by the claimant or on behalf of the claimant by attorneys, court officials, and others.

(2) Soldiers will be informed of paternity claims against them. Commanders will ensure that soldiers are advised of their legal rights and will advise soldiers of their moral and legal obligations in the matter. Soldiers admitting paternity will be urged to provide the necessary financial support to the child. Also, they will take any other action proper under the circumstances.

(b) Procedures for questioning soldiers about paternity claims upon receipt of a claim of paternity against a soldier, the commander will take the following actions:

(1) If there is evidence that an offense (for example, rape, indecent acts with a minor) may have been committed -

(i) Inform law enforcement officials.

(ii) Inform the soldier of the suspected offense. Before questioning, advise the soldier of his right to remain silent under article, 31, UCMJ, and his right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment.

(iii) Coordinate further action under this regulation with the SJA and law enforcement officials if appropriate.

(2) If there is no evidence that an offense was committed -

(i) Allow the soldier a chance to talk with a legal assistance attorney about his legal rights and obligations.

(ii) Require the soldier to complete and sign DA Form 5459-R. Information obtained from a system of records normally will not be released outside DOD without the soldier's consent. (See § 584.1(f).)

(iii) Inform the soldier of Army policy on the support of family members contained in this regulation.

(iv) Advise the soldier that a court order against him on the paternity claim, followed by a refusal to support a child born out of wedlock, could result in -

(A) Administrative or punitive action for violating this regulation.

(B) Garnishment of the soldier's pay account (§ 584.8).

(C) Initiation of an involuntary allotment against the soldier's pay account (§ 584.9).

(D) Contempt of court proceedings.

(v) Ask the soldier about his intentions. Give the soldier the chance to furnish a voluntarily signed statement admitting or denying the claim and stating his intentions.

(c) *Procedures for processing paternity claims.* (1) When one of the conditions in § 584.3(c)(1)(i) applies, a claimant will be advised of the statement in § 584.3(c)(1)(ii).

(i) A soldier -

(A) Refuses to answer questions about the paternity claim.

(B) Denies paternity.

(C) Admits paternity, but refuses to provide financial support.

(ii) No action can be taken on the claim of paternity in the absence of a court order. The court order must identify the soldier in question as the father of the child. Also, the court order must direct that the soldier provide financial support to the child.

(2) The commander will reply directly to the claimant or the attorney or court official she has authorized to act in her behalf. Information obtained from a system of records ordinarily will not be released outside DOD without the soldier's consent. (See § 584.1(f).)

(3) If the soldier admits paternity and agrees to provide financial support, then the commander will -

(i) Ask the claimant to provide a copy of the birth certificate.

(ii) Help the soldier in filing for an allotment or providing other financial aid.

(iii) Advise the claimant of the amount, effective date, and means of payment.

(iv) Help the soldier apply for BAQ at the “with dependents” rate, if applicable. (A birth certificate may be required.)

(v) Ensure an ID card is issued for the child after the relationship is documented, if proper. (A birth certificate may be required.) (See AR 640-3, para 3-3, for dependency criteria for ID cards.)

(vi) Allow the soldier to take ordinary leave in order to marry the claimant, if leave is requested for this purpose. However, the leave may be delayed if it will interfere with military requirements. Travel in connection with leave (including travel to and from overseas commands) is the responsibility of the soldier. Travel will be at no expense to the Government. If the marriage is to take place overseas, the soldier must comply with AR 600-240 and AR 608-61 in applying for authorization to marry (DA Form 2029-R) (Application for Authorization to Marry Outside of the United States).

(d) *Court orders.* If a court order of paternity and support has been issued, the commander will -

(1) Advise the soldier of the policy regarding support of family members.

(2) Advise the soldier that refusal to support his child born out of wedlock could result in -

(i) Garnishment of the soldier's pay account (§ 584.8).

(ii) Initiation of an involuntary allotment against the soldier's pay account (§ 584.9).

(iii) Contempt of court proceedings.

(iv) Administrative or punitive action for violating this regulation.

(3) Refer the soldier to a legal assistance attorney for advice on his legal rights and obligations.

(4) Help the soldier file an attotment or give other financial aid.

(5) Advise the claimant of the amount, effective date, and means of payment.

(6) Help the soldier apply for BAQ at the “with dependents” rate, if applicable.

(7) Ensure an ID card is issued for the child.

(8) Consider administrative or punitive action if the soldier fails to obey the court order. (See § 584.1(d)(5)(viii.)

(9) Inform the first level field grade commander of the soldier's repeated failure to meet the requirements of this regulation. Also, point out actions taken or contemplated to correct instances of nonsupport of family members.
