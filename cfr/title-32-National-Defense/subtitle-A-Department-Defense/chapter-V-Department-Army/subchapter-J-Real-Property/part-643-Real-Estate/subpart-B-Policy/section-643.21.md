##### ยง 643.21 Policy - Surveillance. #####

Installation Commanders will maintain constant surveillance over real estate under their jurisdiction to determine whether any of it is excess to requirements, or may be made available for other Army use, or may be made available for use for other than Army purposes and will process such determinations expeditiously in accordance with the provisions of this regulation. From time to time DOD, DA and GSA surveys will be made pursuant to Executive Order 11954, 7 January 1977, which enunciated a uniform policy for the Executive Branch of the Federal Government with respect to the identification of excess and under-utilized real estate (AR 405-70). Real estate for which is retained for future use will be a requirement which will be disposed of in accordance with AR 405-90. Real estate which the Army does not currently need but which is retained for future use will be made available to others for use either exclusively or concurrently with the Army. When an installation is in an inactive status, the presumption is that it is available for other military or Federal use or for leasing unless there are cogent reasons that such action should not be taken. The purpose of this rule is to put to beneficial use Federal property, which is not for the time required for its basic use, for the benefit of other Federal agencies, the local economy, or for the benefits accruing to the United States from the income and/or savings of maintenance, protection, repair, or restoration.
