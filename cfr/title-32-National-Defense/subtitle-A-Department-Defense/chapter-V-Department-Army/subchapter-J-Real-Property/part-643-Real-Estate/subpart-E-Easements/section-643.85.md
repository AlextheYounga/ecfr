##### ยง 643.85 Easement grantees - Payment for removal or destruction of unneeded improvements. #####

Where a proposed right-of-way will require removal or destruction of improvements which are not required to be relocated or replaced to meet military needs, such improvements will be disposed of as excess property in accordance with AR 405-90, and a condition of the easement grant will be payment for such improvements as follows:

(a) Where the easement grant is to be made at fair market value to entities not entitled to grants of rights of way without charge, the charge for the grant will include the in-place fair market value of the improvements.

(b) Where the proposed grantee is a State or local Government agency normally granted a right of way without charge under Army policy and the grantee's project is subsidized wholly by an agency of the Federal Government, no charge will be made for the improvements thus lost, since any charge made would not reflect a net return to the Government.

(c) Where the proposed grantee is a State or local Government agency normally granted a right of way without charge under Army policy, and the grantee's project is not subsidized, or is subsidized only in part, the charge for such improvements removed or destroyed and not replaced will be the salvage value thereof.
