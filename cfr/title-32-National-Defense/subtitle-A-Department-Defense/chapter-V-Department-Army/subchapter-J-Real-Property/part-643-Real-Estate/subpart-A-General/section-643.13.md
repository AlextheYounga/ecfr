##### ยง 643.13 Military requirement for real estate under grant. #####

When a military requirement arises for real estate which is being used under a grant of non-Army use, the withdrawal of availability will be approved at the same level of command as that required for determining the property available for non-Army use. The office responsible for effecting temporary use of the property should be promptly notified of the withdrawal of availability for non-Army use and the latest date the property will be required for military purposes. Termination of the use will be in accordance with the provisions of the grant unless military necessity requires other action. In order to avoid possible claims for damages and in the interest of good community relations and in furtherance of the Army's leasing program, the grantee will be allowed, when practicable, a reasonable time after notice of revocation, to vacate the premises, remove his property and, if required, restore the premises. In controversial cases, or where a claim for damages or litigation is anticipated, HQDA (DAEN-REM) WASH DC 20314, will be notified of the circumstances prior to sending notification of termination of the grant to the grantee.
