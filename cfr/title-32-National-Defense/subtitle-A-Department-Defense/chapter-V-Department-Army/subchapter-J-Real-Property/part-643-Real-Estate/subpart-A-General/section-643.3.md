##### ยง 643.3 Authority to grant use of real estate. #####

(a) The United States Constitution (Article IV, Section 3), provides that the Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the United States.

(b) One of the principal authorities for the use of military real estate for commercial purposes is title 10 U.S.C., section 2667, which authorizes the Secretary of the Army (SA), whenever it is considered to be advantageous to the United States, to lease such real or personal property under Army control, which is not for the time needed for public use, upon such terms and conditions as the SA considers will promote the national defense or be in the public interest.

(c) Grants under statutory authorities cited in this regulation of real property pertaining to river and harbor, water resource development and flood control projects, will be under the policies and general guidelines set forth in this regulation.

(d) The SA may, under the general administrative powers vested in the office, authorize the use of real estate in the absence of statutory authority, in unusual circumstances, provided the property is not for the time being required for public use, the grant conveys no interest in the real estate and the proposed use will be of a direct benefit to the United States. Under this authority, the right to use real estate may also be granted to other military departments or Federal agencies.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in this regulation, an interest in real estate will not be granted unless authorized by law.

(f) Other laws authorizing grants for non-Army use of real estate for various purposes and Table of Related Army Regulations are set forth in appendixes A and B, respectively.
