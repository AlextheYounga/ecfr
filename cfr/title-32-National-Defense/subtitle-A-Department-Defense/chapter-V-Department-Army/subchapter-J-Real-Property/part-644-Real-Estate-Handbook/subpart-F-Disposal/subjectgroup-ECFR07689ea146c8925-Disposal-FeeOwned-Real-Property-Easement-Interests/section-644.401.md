##### § 644.401 Transfers - general. #####

Résumés of the principal legislative acts authorizing transfer of Army and Air Force real property to other Federal departments are contained in §§ 644.402 through 644.408. The authorities in these acts are exercised independently of GSA regulations. Transfers under these authorities are made without reimbursement. Real property can also be transferred under the Federal Property Act within the scope of disposal authority delegated by GSA. Transfers under the Federal Property Act are subject to reimbursement as prescribed by FPMR, section 101-47.203-7. Property reported to GSA for disposal will be transferred only at the direction of GSA. Excess property excepted from reporting may be transferred by the DE under GSA regulations. Transfers to the Department of the Interior of surplus lands chiefly valuable for migratory bird management are subject to GSA regulations but are made without reimbursement (§ 644.429).
