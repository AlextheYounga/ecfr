##### ยง 644.438 Disposal plan for easements. #####

When recommending disposal of a surplus easement the District Engineer will submit the following:

(a) Information as to when and from whom the easement was acquired.

(b) The consideration paid therefor.

(c) Identification of the installation to which it is appurtenant.

(d) If the easement has no commercial value, the amount that should be paid by the owner of the servient estate, representing a rebate on the purchase price, or the amount paid for severance damages will be specified. (For example, if the easement was acquired for a 15-year period and the price paid therefor was substantial and one year after acquisition it is returned to the owner of the servient estate, an effort should be made to obtain a rebate on the purchase price although the easement has no commercial value. The same would be applicable to the payment for severance damages).

(e) If the owner of the servient estate, or other prospective grantee, is not willing to pay the appraised value in consideration of the release of an easement acquired for a substantial consideration, all action to release the easement will be held in abeyance until such time as an adequate consideration can be obtained for the release. Note the minimum payment for release of spoil easments discussed in paragraph (b) of ยง 644.435.
