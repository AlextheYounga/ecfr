##### ยง 644.525 Statement of clearance in reporting excess property to GSA. #####

The Report of Excess will include the Statement of Clearance furnished by the using command (ยง 644.517). The record of the clearance work performed by the using command will not be included in the Report of Excess but will be preserved in the permanent records of the DE. It is anticipated in these cases that the disposal agency (GSA) will, at the time the land is offered for sale of lease, give public notice of the circumstances surrounding its past and future restricted use. Included in such notice will be the statement that the Department of the Army is willing to remove or destory any potentially dangerous materials discovered at any time in the future, subject to the availability of funds for this purpose.
