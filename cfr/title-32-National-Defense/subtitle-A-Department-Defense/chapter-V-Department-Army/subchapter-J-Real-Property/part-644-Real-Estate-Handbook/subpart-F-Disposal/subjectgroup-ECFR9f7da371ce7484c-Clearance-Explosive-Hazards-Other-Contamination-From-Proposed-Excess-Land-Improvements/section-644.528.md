##### ยง 644.528 Return of contaminated leased land to owners. #####

Where leased land has been contaminated, whether excess to military requirements or being used, it may often prove advisable and economical to acquire the fee to such properties. Prior to considering the return of contaminated leased land to owners, District Engineers will assist installation commanders in preparing an analysis as a basis for recommendation to acquire or not acquire such areas. In the case of recommended restriction of use, notice should be given the lessor as described in ยง 644.525.

(a) Where such a restriction reduces the value of the land, the Department will, if consistent with the terms of the lease, pay damages equal to the reduction in value as of the effective date of termination.

(b) As stated in ยง 644.525, the owner should be advised that the Department is willing to remove or destory any potentially dangerous materials that may be discovered in the future, subject to the availability of funds.
