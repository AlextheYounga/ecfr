##### ยง 644.522 Clearance of military scrap. #####

Military scrap can contain or be contaminated with explosives, chemicals, and other hazardous materials. The primary consideration in determining whether scrap metal will be removed should be the safety of persons coming on the land in question and, secondarily, the prevention of accidents resulting from the sale and/or use of the scrap metal subsequent to the land passing from the jurisdiction of the Department. The DE will insure the removal or destruction, by using command, of all military scrap and scrap metal from lands suitable for cultivation or other subsurface operations. In the case of land unsuitable for cultivation or other subsurface operations, all military scrap will be removed or destroyed and scrap metal removed, if it is reasonably possible to do so. Cases where it is considered impracticable to remove the scrap metal, will be reported to DAEN-REM for final decision. In such instances, pertinent data and the recommendation of the DE will be furnished. Disposition of military scrap or scrap metal by dumping into inland waters or by land burial in other than an approved landfill is prohibited.
