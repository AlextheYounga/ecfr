##### § 644.380 Restoration of lands made available by other Government agencies. #####

(a) *Requirement.* Where the Department retransfers real property, the use of which has been obtained from other Federal agencies (including withdrawals from the public domain recommended for return to the public domain) by means of use permits, public land orders, or other methods, the property should be restored to a condition as good as that which existed at the time the department took possession, damages by the elements or by circumstances over which the Department has no control excepted, unless the agency from which the property was obtained expressly waives restoration. Restoration of public domain land will not be initiated until the determination is made that the land is suitable for return to the public domain. Public domain land that is to be reported excess to GSA will not be restored. The procedure enunciated in §§ 644.516 through 644.539 relative to neutralization of unexploded bombs or artillery projectiles located on leased premises applies with equal force to Government-owned lands returned to other Federal agencies and to public domain land that is to be reported as excess for disposal by GSA.

(b) *Authority.* The report of the Senate Appropriations Committee on the DOD Appropriation Bill, 1966 (Senate Report 625, 89th Congress, dated 18 August 1965), contained the following language:

Such funds as may be required may be used to restore lands under jurisdiction of other Government agencies, damaged while being used for military training purposes under agreement with such agencies.

The Comptroller General considers the foregoing to be a clear expression of Congressional intent, and that authority exists for the Department of the Army to restore (or make payment in lieu thereof) lands of other Federal agencies which have been damaged by the Army while being used under agreement.

(c) *Determination of restoration costs.* ENG Form 1440-R, Cost of Restoration, appropriately modified, will be used for the preparation of an estimate of cost of restoration, or salvage or market value, for the purpose of determining the cost of restoration.

(d) *Payments for, or in lieu of restoration* - (1) *Work performed by the Department of the Army.* If the work is performed by the Department, payment will be made from funds available to the office performing the work.

(2) *Work performed by controlling agency.* If the work has been performed by the agency having administrative control over the property, pursuant to agreement with the Department, reimbursement to that agency may be made by properly supported SF 1080, Voucher for Transfer Between Appropriations and/or Funds, from funds available to the DE.

(3) *Payment in lieu of restoration.* If the work has not been performed by either agency and a payment is desired in lieu of restoration, the payment is, in effect, an advance of funds. As such, the advance of funds will be accomplished in OCE, based on submission by the controlling agency of SF 1080 properly supported.
