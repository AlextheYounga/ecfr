In all cases where Government-owned land is reported, there shall be attached to and made a part of SF 118 (original and copies thereof), a report prepared by a qualified employee of the holding agency on the Government's title to the property, based upon his review of the records of the agency. The report shall recite:

(c) All exceptions, reservations, conditions and restrictions relating to the title acquired.

(d) Detailed information concerning any action, thing or circumstance that occurred from the date of the acquisition of the property by the United States to the date of the report which in any way affected, or may have affected, the right, title, and interest of the United States in and to the real property (together with copies of such legal comments or opinions as may be contained in the file concerning the manner in which and the extent to which such right, title or interest may have been affected). In the absence of any such action, thing or circumstance, a statement to that effect shall be made a part of the report.
