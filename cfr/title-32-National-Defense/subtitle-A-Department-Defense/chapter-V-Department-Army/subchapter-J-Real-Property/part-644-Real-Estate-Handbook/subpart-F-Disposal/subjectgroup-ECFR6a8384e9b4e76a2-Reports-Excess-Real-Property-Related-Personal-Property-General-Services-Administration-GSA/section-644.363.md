##### § 644.363 Withdrawals or corrections of reports of excess. #####

(a) Subject to the approval of GSA, and to such conditions as GSA considers appropriate, Reports of Excess may be withdrawn or corrected at any time prior to disposition of the property, by filing a corrected SF 118 with the regional office of GSA. Corrections and withdrawals will bear the same number as the report of excess to which they pertain, but will bear a letter suffix beginning with “A” for the first correction or withdrawal and continuing in alphabetical sequence for succeeding corrections or withdrawals. “Correction” will be conspicuously stamped on the face of the SF 118 for both withdrawals and corrections. Distribution of requests for withdrawal or correction will be the same as that made of the Report of Excess to which the withdrawal or correction pertains.

(b) Property which is reported to GSA for disposal will not be withdrawn without the prior approval of HQDA (DAEN-REM) WASH DC 20314, nor will return of the SF 118 be accepted without the approval of DAEN-REM. (See §§ 644.340 through 644.347, concerning prior approval of DOD for withdrawals from excess of real property having an estimated fair market value in excess of $50,000.)
