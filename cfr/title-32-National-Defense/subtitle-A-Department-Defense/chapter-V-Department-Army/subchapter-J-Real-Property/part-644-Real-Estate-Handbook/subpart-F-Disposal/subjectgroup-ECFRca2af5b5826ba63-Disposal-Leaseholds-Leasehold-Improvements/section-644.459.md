##### ยง 644.459 Preparation of supplemental agreements effecting settlement. #####

The terms of settlement in lieu of restoration, negotiated with the lessor, will be embodied in a supplemental agreement to the lease, antedating termination, substantially in accordance with ENG Form 341, Supplemental Agreement Transferring Improvements to Lessor. Supplemental agreements may be used to effect restoration settlements of obligations incurred under permits, trespass right agreements, and other unnumbered contracts for the temporary use of land. Restoration settlements may also be effected even though the premises were occupied rent free and without formal contract, provided use of the premises was authorized properly by the Government (Decision of the Comptroller General B-63340, February 1947). Care should be exercised in determining the existence and extent of the legal obligation of the Government to restore. Payment will not be made for doubtful items; instead, the other party to the agreement will be advised of his right to submit a claim. On the other hand, every effort will be made to agree upon a reasonable settlement as to items for which the Government is legally responsible.
