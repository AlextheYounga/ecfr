##### ยง 644.504 Disposal plan for timber. #####

The DE take appropriate action to assure that construction contractors are not authorized, in the clearance of construction sites, to burn or otherwise destroy merchantable timber unless circumstances exist which preclude sale or salvage. In preparing for disposal of timber, a disposal plan will be prepared which will include the following:

(a) Live timber and merchantable dead timber will be marked for cutting in accordance with the land management plan, Master Plan, or forestry supplement thereto, and cutting will be limited to the timber so marked. The disposal plan will contain sufficient information in this respect to permit preparation of specifications for inclusion in the invitation for bids.

(b) Utilization of existing roadways and construction of new roads and saw mills should be limited to the minimum necessary.

(c) Requirement that the customary practices in elimination of fire hazards be observed with necessary specifications therefor.

(d) The installation commander will be consulted to obtain his desires in connection with security measures, and other matters affecting the installations, and the requirements of such measures will be set forth specifically.

(e) Any measures considered necessary to protect timber and young growth not marked for cutting will be specified.

(f) Where an appraisal is required, the appraisal report will be prepared by a competent forester. The report will indicate the number and size of each species and classification of trees to be cut; the estimated board feet in log scale measurement; linear estimates of pole timber, and amount of cord wood. The appraiser should indicate in the appraisal report what, in his opinion, should be acceptable as a minimum price for different types of timber, as well as a total or lump sum estimate for the whole. Methods of administration and sale of timber by the Army or Air Force should follow the same general rules employed by the U.S. Forest Service in its sales and forestry practices. U.S. Forest Service personnel may be available for this work, if desired, on a reimbursable basis, provided the size of the area in question and the location render such arrangements feasible.

(g) Minor sales, involving lots with an estimated value of $1,000 or less, may be accomplished by the reservoir manager on civil works projects under general guidance issued by the DE Real Estate Branch. In such minor sales, two or more informal bids, in writing, will be obtained, if possible. If only one bid can be obtained, the proposed sale will be posted for a period of ten (10) days.
