##### § 644.509 Status as small business. #####

(a) *Definition.* Each invitation for bids for the sale of timber with an estimated value of $2,000 or more will contain a definition of small business and provision for self-certification of the bidder's status within its terms. A definition for use in invitations for bids on Army timber is provided in the “Certificate as to Small Business Status” (Figure 11-20 in ER 405-1-12).

(b) *Self-certification.* 13 CFR 121.3-9(c) provides:

In the absence of a written protest or other information which would cause him to question the veracity of the self-certification, the contracting officer shall accept the self-certification at face value for the particular sale involved.

(c) *Definition for set-asides.* The definition of small business provided in Figure 11-20 in ER 405-1-12 omits portions of the definition prescribed by SBA regulations which are not presently applicable to sales of Army timber. The omitted portions relate to sales of timber reserved for or involving preferential treatment of small business § 644.512. These portions of the definition are subject to frequent revision by SBA.
