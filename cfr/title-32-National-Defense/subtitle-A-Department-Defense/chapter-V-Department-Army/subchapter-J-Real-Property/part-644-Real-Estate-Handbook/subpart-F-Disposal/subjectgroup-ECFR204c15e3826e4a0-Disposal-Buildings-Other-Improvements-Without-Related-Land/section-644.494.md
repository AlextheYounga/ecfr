(a) *General.* Improvements may be abandoned, destroyed or donated to a public body, upon a finding in writing by the DE (but in no event shall such finding be made by the official directly accountable for the property) that the property has no commercial value or that the estimated cost of its continued care and handling would exceed the estimated proceeds from its sale, or that abandonment or destruction is required by military necessity, or by considerations of health, safety or security.

(b) *Finding of Fact.* The finding will be prepared as a separate document headed: Finding of Fact for \_\_\_\_\_\_ The finding will be sufficiently complete within itself to justify the decision to donate, abandon, or destroy the property proposed, without outside reference. It will be drafted to provide, where the finding is made by the District Engineer, for approval by the Division Engineer.

A copy of each such finding, so approved, will be forwarded by the DE to the regional office of GSA.
