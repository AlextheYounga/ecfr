##### § 644.483 Notification of Department of HEW or successor agencies. #####

When buildings or other structures are reported to GSA for screening pursuant to §§ 644.348 through 644.367, the Reports of Excess are available to HEW by the Regional Office of GSA, and no notice of the proposed disposal need be given by the DEs. Where buildings and other structures are not reported to GSA simultaneously with circularization of other Federal agencies, HEW will be notified in writing of the availability of such structures. Such notification will be addressed to the appropriate field representative of HEW, and will include the following information:

(a) A brief description of the buildings and improvements, including dimensions of buildings, types of construction, and demountable characteristics, if any.

(b) The extent of building site clearance expected.

(c) That the improvements must be removed and site clearance completed within a specified definite period from the date of assignment to HEW (usually 60 to 90 days, depending upon the size of the removal operation).

(d) When improvements may be inspected.

(e) That the improvements will be withheld from advertisement for bids for a period of 20 days from the date of the notification, unless the office submitting the notification is sooner informed in writing that such property is not needed for school, classroom, or other educational use or for use in the protection of public health, including research. If within the 20-day period, notice is received of a potential need, the property may be held an additional 45 days until a certification of need or request for assignment is received.
