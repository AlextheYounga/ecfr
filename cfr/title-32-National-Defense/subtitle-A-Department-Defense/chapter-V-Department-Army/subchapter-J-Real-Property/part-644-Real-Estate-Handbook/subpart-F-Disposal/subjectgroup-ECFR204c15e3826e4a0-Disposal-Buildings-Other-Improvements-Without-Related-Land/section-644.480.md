##### § 644.480 Procedure for transfer. #####

Transfer of buildings to other Federal agencies will be accomplished by DD Form 1354. An estimate of value will be shown on DD Form 1354, Transfer and Acceptance of Military Real Property, or other forms used and, in the case of transfer without reimbursement, the following footnote will be made: “Transfer to (Department or Agency), adjustment of funds not required.” When the transfer is made at the direction of GSA, an explanation therefor will also be made on the form. Buildings and other improvements which are reported to GSA for screening against requirements of other Federal agencies (§§ 644.348 through 644.367) will be transferred to another Federal agency only at the direction of GSA and for the amount of reimbursement, if any, determined by GSA. Buildings and improvements which are not required to be reported to GSA will be screened against requirements of other Federal agencies by the responsible DE as provided in §§ 644.333 through 644.339. Upon request by a Federal agency for transfer of such property, the responsible DE will determine the amount of reimbursement, if any, in accordance with the criteria outlined in §§ 644.400 through 644.443.
