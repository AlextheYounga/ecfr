##### § 644.335 Screening of excess DOD property for nondefense Federal agency needs. #####

(a) *Screening by GSA.* (1) GSA will screen all excess real property reported to it for disposal, to determine whether the property is surplus to all Federal agencies.

(2) GSA will screen certain classes of excess real property which must be reported to it for screening, even though the Department of the Army will act as the disposal agency (§§ 644.348 through 644.367).

(3) Under the FPMR, Federal agencies are allowed 30 days to advise whether there is a tentative or firm requirement and another 30 days to determine and advise whether the tentative requirement is firm. Where there is a firm requirement, agencies are allowed an additional 60 days to prepare and submit a formal request for transfer pursuant to FPMR Section 101-47.203-7. The DE should obtain from GSA information on the status of screening if advice is not furnished promptly after expiration of the screening period.

(b) *Screening by Corps of Engineers.* Properties which are not reported to GSA for disposal or screening will be screened by the DE with nondefense Federal agencies at the same time they are screened with Defense agencies. Screening of such properties will be limited to agencies that maintain local offices and may be done on an informal basis. The DE may waive screening of nonassignable and short term interests in real property when they determine such screening will serve no useful purpose. When screening discloses no requirement, the property will be determined surplus and disposed of.
