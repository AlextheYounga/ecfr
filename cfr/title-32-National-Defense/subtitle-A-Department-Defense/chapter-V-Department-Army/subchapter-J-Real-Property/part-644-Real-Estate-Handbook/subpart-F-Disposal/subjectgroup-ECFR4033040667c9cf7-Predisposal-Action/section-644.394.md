##### § 644.394 Protection of disposal information. #####

To prevent premature disclosure to the public, information on and plans for disposal of all or a portion of an installation should be protected (AR 340-16), until such time as the property is determined excess to Army or Air Force requirements. (The Air Force preliminary real estate disposal directive is not issued until a determination has been made that the property is excess to Air Force requirements.) After determinations of excess are made, it is desirable that information on the availability of the property for disposal be widely disseminated. “FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY” marking on plans and correspondence pertaining to the excess action may be cancelled by any recipient or holder. Where the classification “CONFIDENTIAL” or higher has been used, documents must be declassified in accordance with AR 380-5.
