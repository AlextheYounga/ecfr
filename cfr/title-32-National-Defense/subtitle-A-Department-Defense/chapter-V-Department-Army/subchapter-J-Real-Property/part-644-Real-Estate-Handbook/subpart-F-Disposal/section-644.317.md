Purposes of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, (16 U.S.C. 470) and Executive Order 11593, Protection and Enhancement of the Cultural Environment (13 May 1971) will be set forth in subpart H (to be published) and the authorities there cited also apply to the disposal of real property. Specific policy guidance in connection with disposals having historic significance is published in AR 200-1 and AR 405-90 for military real properties and in ER 1105-2-460 for civil works real properties.

(a) The Criteria of Adverse Effect on eligible properties may occur under conditions which include but are not limited to:

(1) Destruction or alteration of all or part of a property.

(2) Isolation from or alteration of the property's surrounding environment.

(3) Transfer or sale of a property without adequate conditions or restrictions regarding preservation, maintenance, or use.

(b) It is normally intended that the agency responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historical Preservation Act of 1966 and Executive Order 11593 run concurrently with the NEPA review process. However, obligations pursuant thereto are independent from NEPA requirements and must be complied with even when an environmental impact statement is not required.
