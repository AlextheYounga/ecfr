##### ยง 644.3 Navigation projects. #####

(a) *Land to be acquired in fee.* All lands necessary for permanent structures, construction areas, public access areas and fish and wildlife purposes will be acquired in fee. No interests need be acquired in areas subject to the Government's right of navigational servitude. Spoil disposal areas may be acquired in fee upon approval of HQDA (DAEN-REA-P).

(b) *Lands over which easements are to be acquired.* (1) Permanent easements are required for channel improvements, navigation pools, navigation aids, and spoil disposal areas for future maintenance. Requirements for navigation aids should be coordinated by the District Engineer with the local Coast Guard District Commander.

(2) Temporary easements may be acquired for temporary disposal of spoil, and temporary construction and borrow areas.

(3) In navigation-only projects, the right to permanently flood should be acquired in all lands located within the navigation pool and the right to occasionally flood should be acquired in lands above the pool. However, when the area to be occasionally flooded above the navigation pool consists of a narrow band of land, the right to permanently flood may be taken therein, to avoid acquisition of two different estates from the same ownership, and/or to reduce overall costs of acquisition.
