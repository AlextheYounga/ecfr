##### ยง 644.7 Acquisition lines. #####

(a) *Tentative acquisition lines.* As indicated in ยง 644.6(c)(1)(iii)(K), tentative acquisition lines are shown on maps which are part of the REDM. However, at that time, the lines will, to some extent, be irregular and located without full regard to their effect upon fringe tracts. It will, therefore, be necessary to establish final acquisition lines, in accordance with sound real estate practices. Accordingly, fringe tracts will not be acquired until the final acquisition lines are approved by the Division Engineer.

(b) *Submission.* As soon as possible after authority has been granted to acquire the land and/or interest therein, the District Engineer will complete appraisals covering the fringe tracts. Thereupon, a map showing proposed final acquistion lines will be submitted to the Division Engineer, accompanied by justification and reasons therefor. This submission may be for an entire project or by segments or units. However, if the final map is submitted on a segment or unit basis, each segment or unit must be complete in itself and not be dependent on another segment or unit not submitted for approval.

(c) *Approval.* The Division Engineer is authorized to approve final acquisition lines, but shall not delegate this responsibility to District Engineers. This authority is subject to the following:

(1) Except for the addition or deletion of individial ownerships, or portions thereof, on the basis of the criteria contained in ยง 644.6(d), approval of any changes in the overall plan will be in compliance with ER 1110-2-1150.

(2) Estates in individual tracts may be changed if consistent with the overall plan. Approval, however, will be required from HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) if the estates are non-standard.
