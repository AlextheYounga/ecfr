##### § 644.4 Reservoir projects. #####

(a) *Joint land acquisition policy for reservoir projects.* The joint policies of the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army, governing the acquisition of land for reservoir projects, are published in the Federal Register, dated February 22, 1962, Volume 27, page 1734. On July 2, 1966, the Joint Policy was again published in 31 FR 9108 as follows:

A joint policy statement of the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army was inadvertently issued as a Notice in 27 FR 1734. Publication should have been made as a final rule replacing regulations then appearing in 43 CFR part 8. The policy as it appears in 27 FR 1734 has been the policy of the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Army since its publication as a Notice and is now codified as set forth below.

Joint Policies of the Departments of the Interior and of the Army Relative to Reservoir Project LandsSec.8.0 Acquisition of lands for reservoir projects.8.1 Lands for reservoir construction and operation.8.2 Additional lands for correlative purposes.8.3 Easements.8.4 Blocking out.8.5 Mineral rights.8.6 Buildings.

Authority: The provisions of this Part 8 issued under Sec. 7, 32 Stat. 389, sec. 14, 53 Stat. 1197; 43 U.S.C. 421, 389.

8.0 *Acquisition of lands for reservoir projects.* Insofar as permitted by law, it is the policy of the Departments of the Interior and of the Army to acquire, as a part of reservoir project construction, adequate interest in lands necessary for the realization of optimum values for all purposes including additional land areas to assure full realization of optimum present and future outdoor recreational and fish and wildlife potentials of each reservoir.

8.1 *Lands for reservoir construction and operation.* The fee title will be acquired to the following:

(a) Lands necessary for permanent structures.

(b) Lands below the maximum flowage line of the reservoir including lands below a selected freeboard where necessary to safeguard against the effects of saturation, wave action, and bank erosion and to permit induced surcharge operation.

(c) Lands needed to provide for public access to the maximum flowage line as described in paragraph 1b, or for operation and maintenance of the project.

8.2 *Additional lands for correlative purposes.* The fee title will be acquired for the following:

(a) Such lands as are needed to meet present and future requirements for fish and wildlife as determined pursuant to the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act.

(b) Such lands as are needed to meet present and future public requirements for outdoor recreation, as may be authorized by Congress.

8.3 *Easements.* Easements in lieu of fee title may be taken only for lands that meet all of the following conditions:

(a) Lands lying above the storage pool.

(b) Lands in remote portions of the project area.

(c) Lands determined to be of no substantial value for protection or enhancement of fish and wildlife resources, or for public outdoor recreation.

(d) It is to the financial advantage of the Government to take easements in lieu of fee title.

8.4 *Blocking out.* Blocking out will be accomplished in accordance with sound real estate practices, for example, on minor sectional subdivision lines; and normally, land will not be acquired to avoid severance damage if the owner will waive such damage.

8.5 *Mineral rights.* Mineral, oil and gas rights will not be acquired except where the development thereof would interfere with project purposes, but mineral rights not acquired will be subordinated to the Government's right to regulate their development in a manner that will not interfere with the primary purposes of the project, including public access.

8.6 *Buildings.* Buildings for human occupancy as well as other structures which would interfere with the operation of the project for any project purpose will be prohibited on reservoir project lands.

(b) *Application of joint policy by Corps of Engineers.* In order to assure that the water and land areas of reservoirs constructed by the Corps are available to the public, the lands which provide access along the shore of the reservoir will be supplemented at selected locations for concentrated public use. Where projects have either recreation or fish and wildlife, or both, as project purposes, additional lands will be acquired as set out in the authorization and specified in design memoranda. The policy contemplates that the United States own in fee a continuous area of land around the reservoir above the water level to insure ready access along the shore. However, certain exceptions have been adopted, as set forth hereinafter. Under the Joint Policy the Corps will take an adequate interest in lands, including areas required for public access, to accomplish all of the authorized purposes of the project and thereby obtain maximum public benefits therefrom. The statements in the policy which define the land interests to be acquired in particular areas are guidelines in application of policy.

(1) *Land to be acquired in fee.* (i) Lands necessary for the dam site, construction areas and permanent structures.

(ii) The lands below a guide contour line (guide acquisition line) established with a reasonable freeboard allowance above the top pool elevation for storing water for flood control, navigation, power, irrigation, and other purposes, referred to in this paragraph as the “full pool” elevation. In nonurban areas generally, this freeboard allowance will be established to include allowances for induced surcharge operations plus a reasonable additional freeboard to provide for adverse effects of saturation, wave action and bank erosion. Factors such as estimated frequency of occurrence, probable accuracy of estimates, and relocation costs, will be taken into consideration. Where this freeboard does not provide a minimum of 300 feet horizontally from the conservation pool, defined as the top of all planned storage not devoted exclusively to flood control, then the guide acquisition line will be increased to that extent. In the vicinity of urban communities or other areas of highly concentrated developments, the total freeboard allowance between the full pool elevation and the acquisition line may be greater than prescribed for nonurban areas generally, and shall be sufficient to assure that major hazards to life or unusually severe property damages would not result from floods up to the magnitude of the standard project flood. In such circumstances, however, consideration may be given to easements rather than fee acquisition for select sections if found to be in the public interest. However, when the project design provides a high level spillway, the crest of which for economy of construction is substantially higher than the storage elevation required to regulate the reservoir design flood, the upper level of fee acquisition will normally be at least equal to the top elevation of spillway gates or crest elevation of ungated spillway, and may exceed this elevation if necessary to conform with other criteria prescribed herein.

(iii) Lands to be acquired for public use, being those reflected in the Recreation Resources Appendix of the Phase I General Design Memorandum (ER 1120-2-400). The Phase I General Design Memorandum is required to be prepared and submitted for approval prior to submission of the Real Estate Design Memorandum.

(iv) Lands required for operation and maintenance of the project for:

(A) Frequently used operational areas.

(B) Clearing and disposition of debris.

(C) Maintenance, repair, and restoration.

(D) Anticipated erosion.

(E) Safeguarding public health, and malaria and mosquito control.

(F) Sanitation.

(v) Lands specifically authorized by the Congress for recreation and fish and wildlife purpose as defined by the Federal Water Project Recreation Act (Pub. L. 89-72) and Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 (Pub. L. 85-624, 16. U.S.C. 661 *et seq*).

(A) All lands to be acquired for fish and wildlife purposes, either mitigation enhancement lands or estates therein required for other project purposes, will be presented in such a way as to distinguish clearly all such lands under each of the separate authorities involved. Specific guidance on fish and wildlife resources is contained in ER 1120-2-400 and ER 1120-2-404.

(B) The purpose of Pub. L. 89-72 is to provide a uniform policy with respect to recreation and fish and wildlife benefits and costs of Federal multiple-purpose water resource projects, and for other purposes.

(*1*) Pub. L. 89-72, as amended by section 77 of Pub. L. 93-251, does, however, create a unique provision relating to local participation in the recreation and fish and wildlife developments in water resource projects. Provisions of that Act, as amended, must be adhered to and contracts for administration of project lands and cost-sharing shall follow the amendments contained in section 77 of Pub. L. 93-251.

(*2*) Section 3(b) of Pub. L. 89-72 further provides that, notwithstanding the absence of an indication of intent as specified above, lands may be provided in project planning which would preserve the recreation and fish and wildlife potential of the project for *subsequent* development by local interests. The act prescribes that local interests must within 10 years after initial operation of the project enter into agreements specified above. In the event such agreements are not obtained, the proposed facilities cannot be constructed and the Corps may utilize the lands acquired for any lawful purpose within the Corps' jurisdiction or may offer said land for sale to its immediate prior owner or his immediate heirs at its appraised fair market value at the time of disposal. In the event that an agreement with the prior owner or his heirs cannot be reached in 90 days, disposal of the property will ensue pursuant to usual disposal procedures.

(*3*) The provisions of Pub. L. 89-72, as amended, are construed to apply to planning for projects authorized in 1965 or thereafter. Accordingly, all planning for future projects must be coordinated with local interests as defined in the law and all design memoranda relating to land acquisition or development of recreation or fish and wildlife areas must clearly set forth the potential of the project for such development and the intent of local interests in fulfilling the requirements of this law.

(*4*) Public Law 89-72, as amended, does not impose a requirement for local participation in all recreation and fish and wildlife areas. Development of recreation areas and planning for fish and wildlife areas will be in accordance with the guidelines set forth in this Chapter and related regulations.

(vi) Lands for resource preservation and/or enhancement in fulfillment of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (Pub. L. 91-190, 83 Stat. 852) and Executive Order 11514 will be those approved in the authorizing document and/or those approved in the Recreation Resources Appendix of the General Design memorandum.

(vii) Uneconomic remnants required to be purchased in fee under section 301(9) of Pub. L. 91-646.

(viii) Recommendations may be made in the Real Estate Design Memorandum to eliminate lands from acquisition located within the approved guide acquisition line but above the guide contour line which are highly developed or devoted to public uses such as parks, golf courses, cemeteries, etc. Also, where for reasons of steep terrain, presence of highways and railroads, severe severance, or for other reasons, sound real estate practice indicates requirement for some adjustments in the area above the guide contour line, recommendations for such adjustments will be included in the real estate design memorandum, or will be subsequently submitted with proposed final real property acquisition lines, for approval of the Division Engineer in accordance with § 644.7.

(ix) Lands which will be covered by any sediment delta that is expected to form as the result of aggradation of streams draining into the reservoir. The estimate of this area shall be based upon the probable sediment inflow for a period at least equal to the economic life of the project.

(2) *Lands over which easements are to be Acquired.* (i) Lands in reservoir areas of flood-control-only projects, which do not provide conservation pools, except as required for public access.

(ii) Lands required for a relatively short time for temporary structures or for use during the construction period only.

(iii) The Joint Policy of 1962 provides that flowage easements *may* be acquired in reservoir projects if *all* four conditions of Section 8-3 of the Joint Policy are met. For the purposes of land acquisition, to distinguish between fee and flowage easement “remote portions of the project area” as referred to in Section 8-3 of the Joint Policy are defined as those lands lying upstream from the conservation pool (the top elevation of all storage other than that devoted exclusively to flood control use) on the main stream and all significant tributaries thereof.

(iv) Lands downstream from the dam and required only for operational purposes.

(v) In flood control projects which do not have conservation pools, the right to occasionally flood should be acquired in all lands, except that the right to permanently flood should be acquired in those lands which may be subjected to permanent flooding, as in the case of a trash pool.

(3) *Levees in lieu of acquisition.* Where construction of levees or flood walls and necessary associated facilities for protection of lands and properties located within potential flowage limits of a reservoir is proposed in lieu of acquisition of fee title or easements over such properties, the protective structures shall meet the following minimum functional requirements:

(i) In urban communities or other areas of highly concentrated developments where overtopping of levees would result in major hazards to life or unusually severe property damage under anticipated future conditions, levee grades and designs shall be adequate to withstand without failure the occurrence of the standard project flood, assuming the reservoir is filled to highest level that is reasonably likely to prevail at the beginning of such a flood.

(ii) Under circumstances where it can be reasonably shown that possible overtopping of protective levees or flood walls as proposed would not result in unusual hazards to life or major property damage, levee grades shall be as high as economically practicable in consideration of apparent risks and costs involved, and flowage easements or other appropriate assurances from local interests shall be obtained insofar as necessary to protect the Government in the event the protective structures are overtopped.
