##### ยง 644.102 Examples of involuntary acquisitions. #####

While the Secretary of the Army and Secretary of the Air Force have no authority to acquire interests in real property except under express authorization and appropriation made by Congress, the Government may, nevertheless, in the performance of an authorized act involuntarily acquire an interest in real property, for which the owner is entitled to just compensation. Whenever a plaintiff successfully prosecutes litigation which establishes that an interest in real property has been taken, the interest so taken should be confirmed in the form of a grant, wherever possible. The instrument should be recorded in the public land records and permanently retained in the real estate files, as evidence of the interest taken and as a protection against possible future claims of purchasers for value without notice. No employee or representative of the Corps of Engineers shall intentionally make it necessary for an owner to institute legal proceedings to prove the fact of the taking of his property, as prescribed by Pub. L. 91-646. Examples of involuntary acquisition are:

(a) Damage to real property caused by flooding, saturation, seepage, erosion, or other causes arising out of the construction, operation, or maintenance of an authorized project.

(b) Damage as a result of overflights of aircraft.

(c) Other instances where Government actions result in a restriction of the use of property.
