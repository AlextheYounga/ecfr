##### § 644.64 Award of contracts. #####

(a) *Contract awards.* Contract awards will be made only by duly qualified contracting officers in accordance with applicable procurement regulations.

(b) *Review of title evidence contracts.* The Contracting Officer, if an employee of the Real Estate Division, or otherwise the Real Estate representative designated by the Division or District Engineer, will review contracts for title evidence.
