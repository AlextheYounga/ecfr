##### ยง 644.116 Distribution, reservations, and title evidence. #####

Distribution of the estimated compensation deposited in the registry of the court is the responsibility of the United States District Court. However, the Division or District Engineer will assist the United States Attorney in arranging for the distribution of funds deposited with a declaration of taking in order that landowners may receive either partial or total payment as soon as possible.

(a) *Distribution.* Partial or total distribution may be made upon a showing to the court that the claimant is the proper person to receive the money on deposit (40 U.S.C. 258a). An examination of the title evidence by the United States Attorney, together with a physical inspection of the premises, is usually sufficient to enable the United States Attorney to ascertain the proper claimants so that he may consent to the entry of an order of distribution. Distribution may be made without prejudice to the owner's right to contest for a higher award than the sum deposited by the United States.

(b) *Inspection and title evidence.* As soon as a condemnation proceeding is filed, a physical inspection of the premises will be made and the United States Attorney will be furnished the following:

(1) ENG Form 798, Certificate of Inspection and Possession, or such other similar form as may be requested.

(2) ENG Form 1567, Report on Vacation of Property.

(3) Title evidence and all available curative material covering the tracts of land included in the declaration of taking.

(4) Copies of all offers to Sell, leases, relocation agreements, etc., which are pertinent to the case and would be useful in making distribution.

(c) *Reservations.* If the landowners are to be permitted to remove crops, timber, buildings or other improvements from land acquired in the declaration of taking (by approval of the Division or District Engineer), a stipulation for reservation of these items may be obtained at this time. The stipulation should be in a form acceptable to the United States Attorney, should specify the date on or before which the reserved items are to be removed, and should provide that if the reserved items are not removed on or before said date, the right of removal shall terminate automatically and the United States shall have a good and indefeasible title to these items without further notice. The consideration to the Government for the reservation will be in an amount not less than the appraised value of the crops, or not less than the appraised salvage value of the timber, buildings or other improvements which are reserved, and the stipulation should provide that such amount shall be deducted from the amount of the final award.

(d) *Continuation of title evidence.* A continuation of the existing title evidence will be obtained to include a search of the records to a date subsequent to the date of filing of the Notice of Lis Pendens, the Judgment on Declaration of Taking, or the filing of the complaint in those states where such filing constitutes notice. The additional title evidence will be furnished to the United States Attorney as soon as possible after filing of the case.
