##### § 644.141 Alterations and construction on leased real property. #####

(a) *General.* Division and District Engineers will be available to the military elements for consultation and review of requirements involving construction on leased land or in leased space. Detailed instructions are furnished in DOD Directives 4165.12, 4165.16, 4165.20, 4270.24, 5160.58, 7040.2; DOD Instruction 5305.5; Army Regulations 140-485, 405-10, 415-25, 415-35, 420-10. Section 644.135(b) covers the requirements of the Economy Act which are applicable to alterations and construction on leased real property. The work to be performed must be essential. Guidelines are furnished as follows:

(1) The proposed alterations and improvements must be advantageous to the Government in terms of economy, efficiency, and, where applicable, to national security.

(2) For office space, the cost should be less than the cost of other space that is available and which does not require alterations or improvements to any appreciable extent.

(3) Due regard is to be given to the convenience of the public that is served and the maintenance and improvement of safe and healthful working conditions of employees.

(4) Where the proposed temporary construction at a leased facility has an estimated cost equal to or in excess of the current market value of the property, the facts will be reported promptly to DAEN-REA-L.

(b) *Initial and subsequent alterations.* (1) Initial alterations to facilities leased by the Corps are the responsibility of the appropriate Division or District Engineer.

(2) Effort will be made to include all required alterations in the rental package with the lessor performing all of the work. Careful attention will be given to possible violations of the Economy Act. Payment for initial alterations may be in a lump sum or by the month with the rent, provided the provisions of the Economy Act are complied with and the alterations costs are stated separately in the file or in the voucher.

(3) Alterations or improvements of any nature in GSA furnished space are the responsibility of GSA. Under certain circumstances, GSA may require a Certificate of Necessity in order to perform the required construction.

(4) Although alterations and improvements subsequent to occupancy are not the responsibility of the Corps, the Division or District Engineer should always review subsequent alteration projects to determine whether or not the limitations of the Economy Act are applicable. See AR 415-34, AR 415-35, and AR 420-10 for procedures and instructions.

(c) *Army National Guard.* No initial alterations regardless of cost will be made to properties leased for the Army National Guard without prior approval of the Chief, National Guard Bureau. (Funds will be made available by the National Guard Bureau.)

(d) *Air Force.* All alterations to premises leased for the Department of the Air Force, including Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard Units, are the responsibility of that Department including the issuance of any Certificate of Necessity for Department of Air Force elements. The only exception is the leasing and modification of leased premises for recruiting facilities.

(e) *Recruiting facilities.* The Chief of Engineers, as the Department of Defense Executive Agent for recruiting facilities, is responsible for initial alterations for all recruiting facilities located on military reservations or leased by the Corps. This responsibility includes recruiting offices and recruiting main stations and detachments, whether single-service or collocated. However, as to recruiting facilities acquired by GSA, all alterations are the responsibility of GSA and processing is accomplished through the Division or District Engineer.

(f) *Permanent construction requirements.* If permanent construction is to be placed on land, the Government must have fee title or acquire title to the land or a permanent easement must be secured, with the following exceptions:

(1) Real property, including land or buildings, which the Government currently holds the right to reuse by exercise of the National Security Clause.

(2) Real property, including land or buildings, which the Government holds the right to reuse by exercise of a National Emergency Use Provision.

Since such rights apply only during the period or periods of national emergency and are extinguished by the termination thereof, every effort will be made to negotiate a lease covering such property under terms that would provide the Government the right of continuous possession for a minimum of 25 years.

(3) Real property required for installation of utility lines and necessary appurtenances thereto, provided a long-term easement or lease can be secured at a consideration of $1.00 per term or per annum.

(4) Real property required for air bases, provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions for:

(i) Right of continuous use by the Government under firm term or right of renewal for a minimum of 50 years.

(ii) A rental consideration of $1.00 per term or per annum.

(iii) Reserving to the Government, title to all improvements to be placed on the land and the right to dispose of such improvements by sale or abandonment.

(iv) Waiver by the lessor of any and all claims for restoration of the leased premises.

(v) Use of the property for “Government purposes” rather than for a specific military purpose.

(5) Property required for facilities for the Reserve Components of the Armed Forces, provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions detailed in paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Whenever possible, the insertion in a lease of a provision restricting the use of land to a specific purpose will be avoided; use a term such as “Government purposes”.

(6) Property required for air defense sites, provided such property can be acquired by lease containing provisions in paragraphs (f)(4)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section and the right of continuous use by the Government under a firm term or right of renewal for as long as required for defense purposes.

(7) Assistant Secretary of Defense (MRA&L) approval is required when leases for air bases, Reserve Components facilities, or air defense sites can be obtained containing some but not all of the above listed provisions. Such approval is also required for leases for all other types of installations upon which permanent construction is to be placed by the Government when leases can be obtained containing similar provisions. In all cases, it must be in the best interest of the Government to acquire a lesser interest than fee title.

(8) Construction projects estimated to cost less than $25,000 will not be considered a permanent construction for purposes of the above policy.

(g) *GSA reimbursement.* Reimbursement to GSA for Standard Level User Charges (SLUC) and other costs incident to leasing will be in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Federal Property Management Regulation.

(h) *Nominal rent leases.* (1) Where premises are occupied by the Government at a nominal rent or rent-free basis, any alterations, improvements, and repairs necessary for occupancy may be considered as a cost of occupancy, *i.e.*, in lieu of rent, for each year of the rental term. However, the total cost of such alterations, improvements, and repairs, plus the nominal rental, during any year of the rental term may not exceed 15 percent of the fair market value at the date of the lease, unless the total cost plus nominal rental does not exceed $2,000 per annum.

(2) When rental plus amounts to be spent by the Government for alterations, improvements, and repairs total more than $2,000 and more than 15 percent of the fair market value of the premises at the date of the lease, a Certificate of Necessity is required.

(3) A Certificate of Necessity is not required for the cost of installing equipment, apparatus, appliances, machinery, fixtures, movable partitions, etc., which are not intended to become an integral part of the building and which may be removed without injuring or defacing the item or the building. Such property is considered to be the property of the Government. The lease or a supplement thereto should provide for the installation and removal of such equipment, etc.

(4) Under the limitations in 40 U.S.C. 278a, not more than 25 percent of the net rental for the original lease period, if less than one year, may be expended before a lease is actually renewed. If the whole period, including renewals, is less than a year, not more than 25 percent of the rent for such whole period may be expended for alterations, repairs, and improvements (20 Comp. Gen. 30; 29 Comp. Gen. 299). Where a lease, entered into by the Government for an original term of less than a year, is renewed for the following fiscal year, the net rental for the first year of the rental term, as distinguished from the original term, is for consideration in the computation of the amount that may be paid under the 25 percent limitation, after the lease is actually renewed.

(i) *Items not within the purview of the Economy Act.* (1) The limitations in 40 U.S.C. 278a are not applicable to leases of unimproved land (38 Comp. Gen. 143).

(2) Where fixtures, alterations, and improvements are of such characters to be of a temporary nature, and are not permanently attached to the realty so as to prevent removal thereof without destroying their usefulness or damaging them or the realty, they do not constitute alterations or improvements of the leased premises within the meaning of 40 U.S.C. 278a and therefore do not fall within the 25 percent limitation of that Act. Title to such temporary fixtures, alterations, and improvements remains in the Government (18 Comp. Gen. 144; 20 Comp. Gen. 105).

(3) Upon termination of leases, restoration of leased premises to the original condition is not considered an alteration within the purview of 40 U.S.C. 278a.

(4) When the Government is required by the terms of the lease to maintain the leased premises, such maintenance, together with the cost of such improvements and alterations as may be made by the Government, may not exceed the 25 percent restriction of the Act.

(5) Leaseholds acquired through condemnation proceedings are excluded from the purview of the Act of 30 June 1932, as amended (40 U.S.C. 278a).

(j) *Architectural Barriers Act.* The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (Pub. L. 90-480), 82 Stat. 718, 142 U.S.C. 4151, *et seq.,* as amended, requires that when Federal funding is used in the design, construction, or alteration of certain buildings or facilities, the buildings or facilities must be designed, constructed or altered to insure that physically handicapped persons will have ready access to, and use of, such buildings. In the Corps' leasing program, when Federal funds are used to make improvements to leased premises, it is necessary that the plans and specifications for the construction or alteration work be approved in accordance with guidelines published by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), as implemented by DOD Construction Criteria Manual 4270.1-M, Section 5-1.6.
