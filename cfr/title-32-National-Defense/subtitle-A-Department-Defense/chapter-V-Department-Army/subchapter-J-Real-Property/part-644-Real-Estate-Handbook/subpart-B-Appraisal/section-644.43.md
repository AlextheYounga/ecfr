(a) *Preparation.* (1) The gross appraisal sections of real estate design memoranda and planning reports are subject to minute scrutiny by higher authority in the Department of Defense and by Congressional Committees. It is essential that they be meticulously prepared to reflect actual market conditions and unit prices.

(2) Each gross appraisal will be supported by detailed analyses of an adequate number of typical comparable sales. Each index sale will be analyzed to show various land classifications and values, building contribution estimates and other relevant information. The sales prices should be verified by someone having knowledge of the transaction.

(3) Where letter-type or brief real estate design memoranda on civil works projects are submitted, comparable sales data will be presented in one of the following methods:

(i) Be submitted within the report in a brief manner, with at least three truly comparable sales discussed in narrative form and comparisons shown to the subject lands covered by the memorandum.

(ii) Be referenced to the last real estate design memorandum issued on the same project and if values have changed in the interim, additional sales data submitted to support the changes. If the last design memorandum is over a year old, new supporting data must be submitted.
