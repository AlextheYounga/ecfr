##### § 644.47 Appraisal of other interests. #####

(a) *Minerals.* (1) In all cases, the value of the subsurface will be included or accounted for in the appraisal report in such manner that negotiations may be readily conducted to acquire or extinguish subsurface rights if they are outstanding in third parties or if it develops that the vendors desire to reserve them. In those instances where minerals are held separately in large blocks underlying several individual surface tracts, a statement to this effect should be included and the plan for appraising the mineral estate identified. Unless the person who is appraising the surface has had training and experience in appraising minerals, the subsurface appraisal should be made separately by an appraiser qualified to perform this service. Since the removal of certain minerals may destroy the usefulness of the surface, care should be exercised to avoid duplication of value.

(2) In the event that subsurface valuation is unfamiliar to the Division or District requiring same, HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314 should be contacted for advice and recommendations. Mineral valuation engineers within the Corps may be utilized on a cost reimburseable basis for furnishing gross or tract appraisals.

(b) *Timber.* (1) Where the land being appraised has only young trees or timber not of merchantable size, the value thereof will be included with the value of the land. If the timber is of merchantable size, a timber cruise will be made by a professional forester and the timber classified in the appraisal according to species, type, range of size, quantity, unit value, and total value. A discussion of logging, haulage, and market conditions will be given. The total value of timber shall be the amount by which the timber enhances the market value of the bare land.

(2) Extreme care must be exercised in the use of separate timber estimates for appraising timber land, so as to avoid “doubling up.” Where a timber cruise or estimate is used, comparable sales of recently timbered land should be used to support the remaining land value. Where such sales are not available, care must be utilized to extract the timber value from sales of timber land. The optimum situation would be to have sales that were also cruised; however, this does not often happen.

(c) *Growing crops.* (1) Crop appraisals will not ordinarily be necessary except in those cases where the Division or District has determined that possession of the cropland is necessary prior to the normal harvest period. Where the Division or District Engineer has determined that the landowner or his tenant cannot be permitted to harvest the crops, they will be appraised as separate property items.

(2) The crop appraisal will identify the crops by type, number of acres, estimated yield per acre taking into account all hazards, the unit value, gross market value at maturity based upon current local prices for the commodities less cost of bringing to maturity, harvest, and delivering to available markets. The expected harvest period will be reported, together with other pertinent information, in order to indicate an approximate date when the cropland may be available for construction purposes.

(d) *Use of Government-owned property.* (1) An appraisal will be made, when required, to justify the consideration reserved in all leases, licenses and easements, except those specifically mentioned in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. The appraisal will be made in accordance with acceptable standards applicable to the particular type of property and the use to be made thereof in the proposed grant, and in accordance with the general appraisal practices and standards heretofore outlined in this chapter. Ordinarily the appraisals of property involving substantial improvements will include, in addition to complete coverage of all factors influencing the use of the property appraised, complete information as to the following:

(i) Data of acquisition and completion of Government construction.

(ii) Complete cost data as to original purchase price and Government construction.

(iii) Detailed discussion of the predominant uses to which the property is adaptable.

(iv) Competitive position of the property with respect to availability of privately-owned properties for similar use.

(v) Estimate of market value of fee title.

(vi) Estimate of annual rental value assuming unrestricted use over a reasonable period of time.

(vii) Estimate of annual rental value under proposed Government restrictions.

(2) Time consuming and lengthy appraisal reports should be avoided in the case of low value grants involving Government-owned property. The consideration in such cases may be substantiated by a simplified appraisal report by a qualified appraiser setting forth only such facts as are required to validate his conclusions as to value. In such instances, a physical inspection of the property may be waived where the appraiser is sufficiently familiar with the property under appraisals and local market conditions to prepare a reasonable value estimate of the estate to be appraised. When a property is not physically inspected, it will be so noted in the appraisal report. The decision concerning the necessity for a physical inspection of the property and analyzing local market conditions will rest with the appraiser signing the appraisal certificate since he is personally responsible for the value conclusion developed in the appraisal report. A low value grant for the purpose of this paragraph is defined as any grant for which the fair market rental value (before applying any offset in rental for estimated savings in maintenance, protection, repair and restoration) does not exceed the following:

Easement - $500 for the term.Lease or License - $500 per annum if granted for not more than a five-year period and is granted after advertising.

(3) The following are exempt from the above requirements:

(i) Leases for land on which to construct new credit union facilities, under long-term leases. See DOD Directive No. 1000.10 for formula.

(ii) Concession leases under Graduated Rental System.
