##### § 644.49 Contracts. #####

(a) *Appraisal reports.* (1) Within their contract authority, Division and District Engineers may contract with recognized appraisal firms, corporations and individuals for necessary appraisal reports on a lump sum basis. Following the award of any appraisal contract in excess of $5,000 a copy of such contract will be forwarded by the issuing office direct to HQDA (DAEN-REE) WASH DC 20314, immediately upon execution.

(2) Requests from Division and District Engineers to the Chief of Engineers for names of appraisers qualified to make particularly complex appraisals are invited.

(3) Division and District Engineers will develop and maintain current lists of qualified appraisal firms, corporations and individuals, from which contractor selection will be made. These lists should be appropriately grouped or rated in accordance with special qualifications and experience in connection with various and specific types of appraisal problems.

(4) Prior to receipt of proposals and negotiations with appraisers, a target fee (Government estimate) will be developed with due consideration to the relative skill and ability required in solving the appraisal problem and the appraiser's time and expense required for preparing the desired reports.

(5) In the negotiation of appraisal contracts the following items are to be considered:

(i) The appraisal of real estate is a recognized profession governed by a code of ethics prohibiting competition in obtaining appraisal assignments. All negotiations for proposals will be conducted on an individual basis, with adequately qualified appraisal firms, corporations or individuals competent to deliver the required appraisal reports on schedule.

(ii) In view of the technical nature of appraisals, Division and District Engineers shall give consideration to designating qualified member(s) of their real estate staffs as contracting officer's representative(s) with full responsibility for all cost estimates involved in contracting for appraisal services and reports. Such contracting officer's representative(s) may also, in the designation of the contracting officer, be utilized to conduct negotiations with the prospective contractors, serve as ordering officer pursuant to the contracts, certify invoices and act in any other capacity within their authority as contracting officer's representative(s).

(6) A copy of the narrative, detailed record of contract negotiations will be forwarded to DAEN-REE, along with the contract as specified above.

(7) In contracting for appraisal reports, contract forms as set forth in Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR) (chapter I of this title) and ER 1180-1-1 (Engineer Contract Instructions) will be used. An outline of the qualifications of the appraiser employed to perform the contemplated services shall be included in the contract assembly.

(b) *Expert appraisal services.* Employment of qualified real estate appraisers and consultants may be effected utilizing the pertinent provisions of ASPR and ER 1180-1-1.

(c) *Obtaining appraisal reports by purchase order.* (1) Division and District Engineers are urged to utilize an authorized type of purchase order, such as DD Form 1155, in lieu of long-form contract, provided that:

(i) It is in the best interest of the Government, cost wise, not to issue the long-form contract.

(ii) The contractor has performed satisfactorily on at least one contract within the prior three fiscal years.

(iii) The total order, by such purchase orders, from the contractor does not exceed $10,000 for the project during the current fiscal year.

(iv) The order is accompanied by a brief history of negotiation signed by both the contractor and the contracting officer's representative(s).

(2) Care should be exercised to insure that the above provisions are used only to order supplementary reports, single appraisals, and other “one-time” reports needed.

(d) *Department of Justice consultation.* Authorized local representatives of the Department of Justice will be consulted concerning the acceptability of the appraiser(s) prior to negotiating any appraisal contract covering tracts proposed for acquisition. The local representative must also approve the per diem fee to be utilized in the appraisal contract. Where agreement cannot be reached between the Division or District Engineer and the local representative of the Department of Justice as to the selection of the appraiser(s), a complete report will be submitted to DAEN-REE, for resolution with the Attorney General.

(e) *Interdepartmental services.* Division Engineers are authorized to arrange for interdepartmental services of qualified specialists in the regular employ of other Government agencies in connection with special problems concerning mineral deposits, water rights, timber cruises, etc. Division Engineers are further authorized, in their discretion, to redelegate this authority or any part thereof to District Engineers.
