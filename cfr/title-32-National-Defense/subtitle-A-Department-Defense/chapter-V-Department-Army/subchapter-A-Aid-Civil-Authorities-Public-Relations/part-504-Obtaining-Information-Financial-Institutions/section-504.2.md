##### § 504.2 Procedures. #####

(a) *General.* A law enforcement official seeking access to a person's financial records will, when feasible, obtain the customer's consent. This section also sets forth other authorized procedures for obtaining financial records if it is not feasible to obtain the customer's consent. Authorized procedures for obtaining financial records follow. All communications with a U.S. Attorney or a U.S. District Court, as required by this part, will be coordinated with the supporting staff judge advocate before dispatch.

(b) *Customer consent.* (1) A law enforcement office may gain access to or a copy of a customer's financial records by obtaining the customer's consent and authorization in writing. (See app. B to this part for a sample format.) Any consent obtained under the provisions of this paragraph must -

(i) Be in writing, signed, and dated.

(ii) Identify the particular financial records being disclosed.

(iii) State that the customer may revoke the consent at any time before disclosure.

(iv) Specify the purpose of disclosure and to which agency the records may be disclosed.

(v) Authorize the disclosure for a period not over 3 months.

(2) Any customer's consent not containing all of the elements listed in paragraph (a) of this section will not be valid.

(3) A copy of the customer's consent will be made a part of the law enforcement inquiry file.

(4) A certification of compliance with 12 U.S.C. 3401 *et seq.* (app. C), along with the customer's consent, will be provided to the financial institution as a prerequisite to obtaining access to the financial records.

(c) *Administrative summons or subpoena.* The Army has no authority to issue an administrative summons or subpoena for access to financial records.

(d) *Search warrant.* (1) A law enforcement office may obtain financial records by using a search warrant obtained under Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in appropriate cases.

(2) No later than 90 days after the search warrant is served, unless a delay of notice is obtained under § 504.2(i), a copy of the search warrant and the following notice must be mailed to the customer's last known address:

Records or information concerning your transactions held by the financial institution named in the attached search warrant were obtained by this (office/agency/unit) on (date) for the following purpose: (state purpose). You may have rights under the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978.

(3) Search authorization signed by installation commanders or military judges will not be used to gain access to financial records from financial institutions in any State or territory of the United States.

(4) Access to financial records maintained by military banking contractors in overseas areas or by other financial institutions located on DOD installations outside the United States, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands is preferably obtained by customer consent.

(i) In cases where it would not be appropriate to obtain this consent or such consent is refused and the financial institution is not otherwise willing to provide access to its records, the law enforcement activity may seek access by use of a search authorization. This authorization must be prepared and issued per AR 27-10, Military Justice.

(ii) Information obtained under this paragraph should be properly identified as financial information. It should be transferred only where an official need-to-know exists. Failure to do so, however, does not render the information inadmissible in courts-martial or other proceedings.

(iii) Law enforcement activities seeking access to financial records maintained by all other financial institutions overseas will comply with local foreign statutes or procedures governing such access.

(e) *Judicial subpoena.* Judicial subpoenas -

(1) Are those subpoenas issued in connection with a pending judicial proceeding.

(f) *Formal written request.* (1) A law enforcement office may formally request financial records when the records are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry. This request may be issued only if -

(i) The customer has declined to consent to the disclosure of his or her records, or

(ii) Seeking consent from the customer would compromise or harmfully delay a legitimate law enforcement inquiry.

(i) While awaiting receipt of a potential customer challenge, or

(ii) While awaiting the filing of an application for an injunction by the customer.

(7) Proper preparation of the formal written request and notice to the customer requires preparation of motion papers and a statement suitable for court filing by the customer.

These documents are required by statute; their preparation cannot be waived.
