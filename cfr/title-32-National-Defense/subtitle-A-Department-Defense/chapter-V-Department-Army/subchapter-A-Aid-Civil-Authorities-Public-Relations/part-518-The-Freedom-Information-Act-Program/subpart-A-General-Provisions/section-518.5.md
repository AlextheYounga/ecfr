(a) This part governs written FOIA requests from members of the public. It does not preclude the release of personnel or other records to agencies or individuals in the Federal Government for use in official work.

(b) Soldiers and civilian employees of the Department of the Army (DA) may, as private citizens, request DA or other agencies' records under the FOIA.

It is not necessary for soldiers or civilian employees to go through the chain of command to request information under the FOIA.
