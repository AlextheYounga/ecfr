(b) *ITEM 2 Initial Request Exemptions and Other Reasons* - (1) *Exemptions invoked on initial request determinations.* Enter the number of times an exemption was claimed for each request that was denied in full or in part.

(e) *ITEM 5 Number and Median Age of Initial Cases Pending:*

(1) *Total initial cases pending:*

(i) *Beginning and ending report period:* Midnight, 2400 hours, September 30, of the Preceding Year - or - 0001 hours, October 1, is the beginning of the report period. Midnight, 2400 hours, is the close of the reporting period.

(ii) The number for the beginning report period must be the same number reported as of the end of the report period from the previous report.

(2) *Median age of initial requests pending*: Report the median age in days (including holidays and weekends) of initial requests pending.

(3) *Examples of median calculation.* (i) If given five cases aged 10, 25, 35, 65, and 100 days from date of receipt as of the previous September 30th, the total requests pending is five (5). The median age (days) of open requests is the middle, not average value, in this set of numbers (10, 25, 35, 65, and 100), 35 (the middle value in the set).

(ii) If given six pending cases, aged 10, 20, 30, 50, 120, and 200 days from date of receipt, as of the previous September 30th, the total requests pending is six (6). The median age (days) of open requests 40 days (the mean [average] of the two middle numbers in the set, in this case the average of middle values 30 and 50).

(4) *Accuracy of calculations.* Activities must ensure the accuracy of calculations. As backup, the raw data used to perform calculations should be recorded and preserved. This will enable recalculation of median [and mean values] as necessary. Activities may require subordinate elements to forward raw data, as deemed necessary and appropriate.

(5) *Average.* If an Activity believes that “average” (mean) processing time is a better measure of performance, then report “averages” (means) as well as median values (e.g., with data reflected and plainly labeled on plain bond as an attachment to the report). However, “average” (mean) values will not be included in the consolidated Army report unless all Activities report it.

(f) *ITEM 6 Number of Initial Requests Received During the Fiscal Year.* Enter the total number of initial FOIA requests received during the reporting period (fiscal year being reported).

(g) *ITEM 7 Types of Requests Processed and Median Age.* Information is reported for three types of initial requests completed during the reporting period: Simple; Complex; and Expedited Processing. The following items of information are reported for these requests:

(1) *Total number of initial requests.* Enter the total number of initial requests processed [completed] during the reporting period (fiscal year) by type (Simple, Complex and Expedited Processing) in the appropriate row on the form.

(2) *Median age (days).* Enter the median number of days [calendar days including holidays and weekends] required to process each type of case (Simple, Complex and Expedited Processing) during the period in the appropriate row on the form.

(3) *Example.* Given seven initial requests, multitrack - simple completed during the fiscal year, aged 10, 25, 35, 65, 79, 90 and 400 days when completed. The total number of requests completed was seven (7). The median age (days) of completed requests is 65, the middle value in the set.

(h) *ITEM 8 Fees Collected From the Public.* Enter the total amount of fees collected from the public during the fiscal year. This includes search, review and reproduction costs only.

(i) *ITEM 9 FOIA Program Costs* - (1) *Number of full time staff.* Enter the number of personnel your agency had dedicated to working FOIA full time during the fiscal year. This will be expressed in work-years [man-years]. For example: “5.1, 3.2, 1.0, 6.5, et al.”
