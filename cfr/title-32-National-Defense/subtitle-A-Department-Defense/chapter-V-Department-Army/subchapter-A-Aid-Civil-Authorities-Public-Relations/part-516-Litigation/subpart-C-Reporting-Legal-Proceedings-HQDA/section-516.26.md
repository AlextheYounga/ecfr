##### § 516.26 Unsworn declarations under penalty of perjury. #####

(a) *General.* Under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. l746, whenever any matter is required or permitted to be established or proven by a sworn statement, oath or affidavit, such matter may also be established or proven by an unsworn written declaration under penalty of perjury. Because such declaration does not require a notary or other official to administer oaths, individuals preparing statements for use in litigation should consider using this format. (See figure C-3, appendix G, of this part).

(b) *When executed within the United States.* Place the following at the end of the witness statement:

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. (28 U.S.C. 1746).

Executed on(Date) (Signature)

(c) *When executed outside the United States.* Place the following at the end of the witness statement:

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the foregoing is true and correct. (28 U.S.C. 1746).
