(a) The JROTC/NDCC is organized into units at public and private secondary schools. The NDCC differs from the JROTC in that NDCC instructors must be provided by the school. Although these instructors are subject to Army approval, there is no cost-sharing arrangement as exists for JROTC. Also schools or students must provide uniforms, if desired, in the NDCC program. Schools desiring to conduct either program must apply to the region commander of the area in which the school is located. To participate in the program a school must maintain an enrollment in the unit of at least one hundred physically fit students who are at least 14 years of age and meet one of the following accreditation standards:
