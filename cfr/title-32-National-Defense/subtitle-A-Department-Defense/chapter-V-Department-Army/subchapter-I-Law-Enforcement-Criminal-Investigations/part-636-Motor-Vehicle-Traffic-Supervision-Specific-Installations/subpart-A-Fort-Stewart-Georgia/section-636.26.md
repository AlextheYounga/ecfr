##### ยง 636.26 Pedestrian's rights and duties. #####

(a) Pedestrians will obey all traffic control devices and regulations, unless directed to do otherwise by the Military Police.

(b) When traffic-control signals are not in place or not in operation, the driver of a vehicle will yield the right of way, by slowing down or stopping, when a pedestrian is in a crosswalk on the same side of the road as the driver's vehicle, or when the pedestrian is approaching so closely from the opposite half of the roadway as to be in danger.

(c) Pedestrians will not suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle which is so close to the crosswalk that it is impractical for the driver to stop.

(d) Pedestrians crossing a roadway, at a point other than a crosswalk, will yield the right-of-way.

(e) Pedestrians will not cross any intersection diagonally unless clearly authorized to do so.

(f) Every driver will exercise due care to avoid colliding with any pedestrian upon any roadway and will exercise proper precaution upon observing any child or any obviously confused, incapacitated, or intoxicated person.

(g) A person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug to a degree which renders himself a hazard will not walk upon any roadway.

(h) Pedestrians will use sidewalks, where provided, rather than walking upon the roadway. When sidewalks are not provided, pedestrians will walk the shoulder of the roadway as far from the edge of the roadway as possible. When neither sidewalks nor a shoulder are available, pedestrians will walk on the extreme edge of the roadway, facing traffic, and will yield to all oncoming traffic.

(i) Individuals will not stand in or beside the roadway to solicit rides (hitch-hike).

(j) Individuals will not stand in or beside the roadway to solicit business, employment, or contributions from the occupant of any vehicle.
