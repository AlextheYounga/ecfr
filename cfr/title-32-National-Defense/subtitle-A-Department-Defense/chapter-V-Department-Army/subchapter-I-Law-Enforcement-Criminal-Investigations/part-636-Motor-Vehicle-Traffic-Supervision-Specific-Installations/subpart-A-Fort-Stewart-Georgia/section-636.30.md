##### § 636.30 Stopping, standing and parking. #####

(a) Drivers will not stop, park, or leave standing their vehicle, whether attended or unattended, upon the roadway when it is possible to stop, park or leave their vehicle off the roadway. In any case, parking or standing the vehicle upon the roadway will only be done in an emergency.

(b) Vehicles, not clearly identified as operated by a handicapped individual, will not be parked in a handicapped parking space.

(c) Whenever Military Police find a vehicle parked or stopped in violation of this section, they may immediately move, or cause to be moved, the vehicle off the roadway. At the direction of the Provost Marshall, or his designee, vehicles parked in restricted or reserved parking spaces, may be moved.

(d) The Military Police may remove or cause to be removed, to a safe place, any unattended vehicle illegally left standing upon any highway or bridge or within 10 feet of any railroad track on the installation.

(e) As a crime prevention measure, the Military Police may pick up keys left in vehicles, secure the vehicle in place, and post a notice directing the owner to proceed to the MP station to claim his/her keys. The program will be adequately publicized and will only be invoked after a conscientious attempt to locate the owner.

(f) No driver will stop, stand, or park a vehicle:

(1) On the roadway side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge of a curb or a street.

(2) On a sidewalk.

(3) Within an intersection.

(4) On a crosswalk.

(5) Alongside or opposite any street excavation or obstruction when traffic would be obstructed.

(6) Upon a bridge or other elevated structure.

(7) On any railroad tracks or within 10 feet of any rail road track.

(8) On any controlled-access highway.

(9) Where prohibited by official signs.

(10) Alongside any roadway in any manner which obstructs traffic.

(g) No driver will stand or park a vehicle, whether occupied or not, except momentarily to pick up or discharge a passenger or passengers:

(1) In front of a public or private driveway.

(2) Within 10 feet of a fire hydrant.

(3) Within 20 feet of a crosswalk at an intersection.

(4) Within 20 feet upon the approach to any flashing signal, a stop sign, yield sign, or traffic control signal located at the side of a roadway.

(5) Within 20 feet of a driveway entrance to any fire station and on the side of a street opposite the entrance to any fire station within 75 feet of said entrance (when properly sign posted).

(6) At any place where official signs prohibit standing.

(7) Adjacent to any curb painted yellow or identified, by signs, as a “No Parking” area.

(8) Along a roadway against the flow of traffic.

(9) Within 20 feet of any building in what would reasonably be considered a “fire-lane” unless specified as a parking space.

(10) Parallel parking along the curb is authorized in housing areas unless otherwise posted.

(11) Parking is prohibited upon lawns or grassed (seeded) areas, unless specifically authorized by the Provost Marshal. This prohibition is not intended, however, to extend to those locations designated as bivouac sites, range areas, etc.

(12) No dual-wheeled or tandem-wheeled recreational vehicles and trailers will be stored at government quarters. All other recreational vehicles, to include campers, trailers, boats, pop-up campers, and camper shells may be parked in the driveway area or under the carport of individual quarters. To prevent injury to children playing on and around trailers, one tire on each side of the trailer will be chocked in front and back. Trailer tongues, without installed supports, will either be left on the ground or supported in such a manner as to preclude the support tipping over and allowing the trailer tongue to fall. If the vehicle creates a safety hazard or is an eyesore, personnel are encouraged to use the storage facilities available at the Outdoor Recreation Center, Holbrook Pond, Fort Stewart, or at the Private Vehicle Storage area at Hunter Army Airfield. House trailers are not authorized to be parked in the quarters area. Campers, camper trailers, and tents will not be approved for occupancy in the quarters area. Parking of recreational vehicles on the street will be limited to 24 hours for owners to load and unload the vehicle at the owner's quarters.

(h) No driver will use a parking lot, sidewalk, fire lane, or vacant property to drive on in order to avoid a traffic control device or alter the traffic flow plan unless authorized to do so by the Military Police or a traffic control device.
