(2) Impound, exclude, or remove from the reservation any vehicle used as an instrument in a crime, suspected of being stolen, abandoned, inoperable, unregistered, or being operated by a person under the influence of intoxicants or drugs. No vehicle will be impounded unless the impoundment meets the requirements of AR 190-5, paragraph 6-2 (32 CFR 634.50) and ยง 636.38 of this subpart. In the event a vehicle is impounded as an instrument of crime (particularly in the transport of illegal drugs or weapons), coordination will be made with the appropriate civilian law enforcement agencies.
