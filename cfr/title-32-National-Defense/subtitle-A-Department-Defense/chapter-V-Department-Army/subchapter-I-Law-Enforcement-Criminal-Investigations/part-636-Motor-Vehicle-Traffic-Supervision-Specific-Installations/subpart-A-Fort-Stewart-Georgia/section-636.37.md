##### § 636.37 Use of “Denver Boot” device. #####

The “Denver Boot” device will be used by Military Police as an additional technique to assist in the enforcement of parking violations when other reasonably effective but less restrictive means of enforcement (such as warnings, ticketing, reprimands, suspensions, or revocations of on-post driving privileges) have failed, or immobilization of the private owned vehicle is necessary for safety.

(a) The use of booting devices will be limited to application by the Military Police under the following conditions:

(1) Immobilization of unsafe, uninspected, or unregistered vehicles.

(2) Immobilization of vehicles involved in criminal activity.

(3) For repeat offenders of the parking violations outlined in this supplement. Three or more parking violations within 6 months constitutes grounds to boot the vehicle.

(4) At the discretion of the Provost Marshal or his designee, on a case-by-case basis.

(b) Booted vehicle will be marked, for driver notification, by placing an orange in color notice on the vehicle windshield. The notice will contain information on why the vehicle was booted and instructions on how to have the booting device properly removed by the Military Police (see figure 636.37).
