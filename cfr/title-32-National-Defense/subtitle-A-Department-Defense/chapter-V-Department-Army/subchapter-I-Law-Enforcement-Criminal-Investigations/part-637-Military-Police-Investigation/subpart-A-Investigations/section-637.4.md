##### ยง 637.4 Military Police and the USACIDC. #####

(a) The military police or the USACIDC are authorized to investigate allegations of criminal activity occurring on the installation. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to conflict with or otherwise undermine the delineation of investigative responsibilities between the military police and the USACIDC as set forth in AR 195-2.

(b) When investigative responsibility is not clearly defined, and the matter cannot be resolved between military police investigations supervisors and USACIDC duty personnel, or between military police investigations supervisors and unit commanders, the provost marshal will be informed and will resolve the matter with the appropriate USACIDC activity commander/Special Agent in Charge (SAC) or unit commander.

(c) The control and processing of a crime scene and the collection and preservation of the evidence are the exclusive responsibilities of the investigator or supervisor in charge of the crime scene when the military police have investigative responsibility. To prevent the possible loss or destruction of evidence, the investigator or supervisor in charge of the crime scene is authorized to exclude all personnel from the scene. The exercise of this authority in a particular case may be subject to the requirement to preserve human life and the requirement for continuing necessary operations and security. These should be determined in conjunction with the appropriate commander and, where applicable, local host country law enforcement authorities.

(d) Unit commanders should consult with the installation provost marshal concerning all serious incidents. Examples of incidents appropriate for investigation at the unit level include simple assaults not requiring hospitalization and not involving a firearm, or wrongful damage to property of a value under $1,000. Other incidents should be immediately referred to the installation provost marshal.

(e) The military police desk is the official point of contact for initial complaints and reports of offenses. The provisions of AR 190-45 are to be followed for all military police records, reports, and reporting.

(1) When incidents are reported directly to a USACIDC field element, USACIDC may either direct the reporting person to the MP desk or report the incident to the MP desk themselves.

(2) Upon receipt of the complaint or report of offense, the MP desk will dispatch an available patrol to the scene of the incident. The patrol will take appropriate measures to include locating the complainant, witnesses, suspects, and victims, apprehending offenders, securing the crime scene, rendering emergency assistance, determining and reporting to the MP desk, by the most expeditious means possible, the appropriate activity having investigative responsibility.

(f) In those cases in which the USACIDC has an ongoing investigation (typically fraud and narcotics matters), they may delay notification to the military police to avoid compromising their investigation.

(g) Procedures will be developed to ensure mutual cooperation and support between MPI, DAC detectives/investigators and USACIDC elements at each investigative level; however, MPI, DAC detectives/investigators and USACIDC personnel will remain under command and control of their respective commanders at all times.

(1) With the concurrence of the commander concerned, MPI and DAC detectives/investigators may provide assistance to USACIDC whenever elements assume responsibility for an investigation from MPI.

(2) When requested by a USACIDC region, district, or the special agent-in-charge of a resident agency, the provost marshal may provide MPI or DAC detective/investigator assistance to USACIDC on a case-by-case basis or for a specified time period.

(3) With the concurrence of the appropriate USACIDC commander, CID personnel may be designated to assist MPI or DAC detectives/investigators on a case-by-case basis without assuming control of the investigation.

(4) Modification of investigative responsibilities is authorized on a local basis if the resources of either USACIDC or the military police cannot fully support their investigative workload and suitable alternatives are not available. Such modifications will be by written agreement signed by the provost marshal and the supporting USACIDC commander. Agreements will be in effect for no more than two years unless sooner superseded by mutual agreement.
