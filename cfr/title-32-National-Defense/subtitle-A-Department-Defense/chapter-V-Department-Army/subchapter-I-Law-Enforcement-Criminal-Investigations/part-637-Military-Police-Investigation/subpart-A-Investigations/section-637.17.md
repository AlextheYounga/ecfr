##### § 637.17 Police Intelligence. #####

(a) The purpose of gathering police intelligence is to identify individuals or groups of individuals in an effort to anticipate, prevent, or monitor possible criminal activity. If police intelligence is developed to the point where it factually establishes a criminal offense, an investigation by the military police, (USACIDC) or other investigative agency will be initiated.

(b) Police intelligence will be actively exchanged between Department of Defense (DOD) law enforcement agencies, military police, USACIDC, local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies. One tool under development by DOD for sharing police intelligence is the Joint Protection Enterprise Network (JPEN). JPEN provides users with the ability to post, retrieve, filter, and analyze real-world events. There are seven reporting criteria for JPEN:

(1) Non-specific threats;

(2) Surveillance;

(3) Elicitation;

(4) Tests of Security;

(5) Repetitive Activities;

(6) Bomb Threats/Incidents; and

(7) Suspicious Activities/Incidents.

(c) If a written extract from local police intelligence files is provided to an authorized investigative agency, the following will be included on the transmittal documents: “This document is provided for information and use. Copies of this document, enclosures thereto, and information therefrom, will not be further released without the prior approval of the installation Provost Marhsall.

(d) Local police intelligence files may be exempt from certain disclosure requirements by AR 25-55 and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).
