##### § 637.2 Use of MPI and DAC Detectives/Investigators. #####

Only those matters requiring investigative development will be referred to the MPI for investigation. Provost marshals will develop procedures to determine which incidents will be referred to the MPI for completion and which will be retained and completed by uniformed MP personnel. Except as otherwise provided, MPI and DAC detectives/investigators will normally be employed in the following investigations:

(a) Offenses for which the maximum punishment listed in the Table of Maximum Punishment, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 2002 is confinement for 1 year or less. Provisions of the Federal Assimilative Crimes Act will also be considered when assigning cases to MPI. The same punishment criteria apply.

(b) Property-related offenses when the value is less than $1,000 provided the property is not of a sensitive nature, such as government firearms, ammunition, night vision devices, or controlled substances.

(c) Offenses involving use and/or possession of non-narcotic controlled substances when the amounts are indicative of personal use only. Military police will coordinate with the local USACIDC element in making determinations of “personal use”. MPI and DAC detectives/investigators may be employed in joint MPI/USACIDC drug suppression teams; however, the conduct of such operations and activities remain the responsibility of USACIDC. When employed under USACIDC supervision, MPI and DAC detectives/investigators may also be utilized to make controlled buys of suspected controlled substances.

(d) Activities required for the security and protection of persons and property under Army control, to include support of Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Boards as prescribed in AR 190-24. If MPI detect a crime-conducive condition during the course of an investigation, the appropriate physical security activity will be promptly notified. Crime-conducive conditions will also be identified in military police reports.

(e) Allegations against MP personnel, when not within the investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.

(f) Offenses committed by juveniles, when not within the investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.

(g) Gang or hate crime related activity, when not within the investigative responsibilities of USACIDC.
