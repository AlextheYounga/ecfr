##### ยง 632.5 Use of firearms. #####

(a) If it becomes necessary to use a firearm in any of the circumstances described in ยง 632.4 of this part, observe the following precautions when possible:

(1) Give an order to halt before firing.

(2) Do not fire if shots are likely to harm innocent bystanders.

(3) Since warning shots could harm innocent bystanders, avoid firing them. However, when lesser degrees of force have failed, the law enforcement or security person may judge that warning shots would help to control the situation without using deadly force. If able to avoid hazards to innocent persons in these cases, fire warning shots.

(4) Aim to disable. At times it may be difficult to fire with enough precision to ensure disabling rather than killing. If the use of firearms are otherwise authorized by this regulation, such circumstances will not rule out their use.
