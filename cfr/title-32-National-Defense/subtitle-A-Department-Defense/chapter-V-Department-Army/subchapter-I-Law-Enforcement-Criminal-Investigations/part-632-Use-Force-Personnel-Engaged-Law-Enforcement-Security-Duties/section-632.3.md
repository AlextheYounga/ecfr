##### § 632.3 Policy. #####

(a) Law enforcement and security personnel will use force only when they cannot fulfill their duties without it. They will use the minimum force needed; only as a last resort will they use deadly force. (See §§ 632.3(c), 632.4, and 632.5.)

(b) Commanders are encouraged to substitute nonlethal devices (such as night sticks) for firearms when adequate for law enorcement and security personnel to safely fulfill their duties.

(c) In evaluating the degree of force needed for specific law enforcement or security situations, consider these options:

(1) Verbal persuasion.

(2) Unarmed defense techniques.

(3) Chemical aerosol irritant projectors (M36). (May be subject to host nation or local restrictions.)

(4) MP club.

(5) MP working dogs.

(6) Deadly force. (§ 632.4)

(d) Entrapment, *i.e.*, inducing someone to commit an offense in order to prosecute that person, is not permitted in law enforcement or security duties.

(e) Use MP working dogs in accordance with the provisions of AR 190-12. Release dogs only if a lesser measure of force would not be effective.

(1) Releasing a sentry dog to apprehend a suspect is a greater measure of force than releasing a patrol dog.

(2) Before releasing a military dog for attack, give a challenge or order to halt.
