(a) Deadly force is destructive physical force directed against a person or persons (e.g., firing a lethal weapon). Use it only in extreme need, when all lesser means have failed or cannot reasonably be used. Use deadly force for one or more of the following reasons only:

(1) In self-defense, when in imminent danger of death or serious injury.

(2) To protect property related to national security, when reasonably necessary to prevent -

(i) Threatened theft, damage, or espionage aimed at property or information specified by a commander or other competent authority as vital to national security. (See paragraph (b) of this section.)

(ii) Actual theft, damage, or espionage aimed at property or information which, though not vital, is substantially important to national security. (See paragraph (b) of this section.)

(iii) Escape of an individual whose unauthorized presence near property or information vital to national security is a reasonable threat of theft, sabotage, or espionage.

(3) To prevent actual theft or sabotage of property (such as operable weapons or ammunition) which could cause deadly harm to others in the hands of an unauthorized person.

(4) To prevent serious offenses against a person or persons (e.g., armed robbery, rape, or violent destruction of property by arson, bombing).

(5) To apprehend a suspect believed to have committed any of the types of offenses named in paragraphs (a) (2), (3), and (4) of this section.

(6) To prevent the escape of a prisoner (when authorized by a commander or other competent authority and reasonably necessary).

(7) To obey lawful orders from higher authority governed by this regulation.

(b) A commander or other competent authority will specify that property or information is -

(1) Vital to national security only when its loss, damage, or compromise would seriously harm national security or an essential national defense mission.

(2) Substantially important to national security based on the mission and the material or information required to perform it.

(c) To comply with local law or international agreement or arrangements, a commander may impose further restrictions on using deadly force. (Restrictions should not unduly compromise U.S. security interests).

(d) Security criteria and standards for protection of nuclear weapons (paragraph (c) of this section AR 50-5-1) and for chemical agents (paragraph (c) of this section AR 50-6-1) also apply.
