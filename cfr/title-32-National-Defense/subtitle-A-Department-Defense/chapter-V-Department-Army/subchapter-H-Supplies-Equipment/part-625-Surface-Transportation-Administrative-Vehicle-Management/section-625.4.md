##### § 625.4 OCE policy. #####

Pursuant to the authorities, penalties and interpretations cited in the preceding references, Commanders/Directors of field operating agencies may authorize dependents to accompany a Corps of Engineers employee during official travel when using a Government-owned or leased motor vehicle, providing the following procedures and restrictions are adhered to:

(a) The Commanders/Directors of field operating agencies must make a Determination that transportation of the dependent is in “the interest of the Government”.

(b) A determination of “the interest of the Government” is a matter of administrative discretion, taking into consideration the following limitations:

(1) The use of motor vehicles shall be restricted to the “official use” of the vehicles, and any questions concerning “official use” shall be resolved in favor of strict compliance with statutory provisions and policies of this and other pertinent regulations.

(2) When the travel of the dependent is in “the interest of the Government” and incidentally provides a convenience to the employee, then there can be no objection to the employee's enjoyment of that convenience. However, the convenience of itself, provides no justification to authorize dependent travel.

(3) Dependent travel will not be provided or authorized when justification is based on reasons of rank or prestige.

(4) Transportation to, from and between locations for the purpose of conducting personal business or engaging in other activities of a personal nature by military personnel, civilian officials and employees, members of their families or others is prohibited.

(c) Increased travel time (rest stops) and operational inefficiency (added weight) occasioned by the number of dependents to be transported will also be considered.

(d) Dependents must understand and agree never to operate the motor vehicle consigned to the employee for official travel.

(e) Neither the seating capacity nor the size of the motor vehicle will be changed or increased to accommodate dependent travel.

(f) Motor vehicles as used in this regulation applies to all types of motor vehicles, owned, consigned to or leased by the Corps of Engineers.
