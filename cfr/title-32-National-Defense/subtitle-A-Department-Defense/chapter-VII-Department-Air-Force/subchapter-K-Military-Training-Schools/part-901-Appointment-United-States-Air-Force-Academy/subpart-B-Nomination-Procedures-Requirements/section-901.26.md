##### ยง 901.26 Cadet's oath of allegiance. #####

On admission, each appointee (except foreign cadets) will be required to take the following oath of allegiance:

I (name), having been appointed an Air Force cadet in the United States Air Force, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office of which I am about to enter. So Help Me God.

If an appointee refuses to take and subscribe to the oath, the appointment is terminated.
