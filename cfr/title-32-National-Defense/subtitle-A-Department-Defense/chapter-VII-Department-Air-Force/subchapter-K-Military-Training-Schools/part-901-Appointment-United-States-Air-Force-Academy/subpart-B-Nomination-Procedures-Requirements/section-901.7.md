##### ยง 901.7 Precandidate evaluation. #####

The Air Force Academy conducts a precandidate evaluation program as an initial step in the admissions process and as an aid to Members of Congress in screening their applicants for nomination.

(a) Applicants normally are sent a precandidate packet, including USAFA Form 149, Precandidate Questionnaire, with a request for the applicant to provide academic, athletic, leadership, and medical information.

(b) The Academy evaluates the precandidate information and provides an analysis to appropriate congressional offices. Such information gives the nominating authorities an indication of the applicant's potential to qualify for admission and the applicant's self-reported medical status; it does not, however, reflect the applicant's final admission status. It is intended only to aid in selecting the best-qualified applicants for nomination.

(c) Applicants whose evaluation indicates they are fully qualified will be notified and advised to seek a nomination. Individuals whose evaluations reflect areas needing improvement are informed and encouraged to submit additional test scores or information in an effort to meet the qualifying levels.
