##### ยง 884.3 Placing member under restraint pending delivery. #####

Continue restraint only as long as is reasonably necessary to deliver the member to civilian authorities. See AFPD 51-10, paragraph 5. To determine whether probable cause exists and whether a reasonable belief exists that restraint is necessary, the commander should refer to the Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), 1984, specifically, Rules for Courts-Martial (RCM) 305(h)(2)(B), and the discussion following it. The requirement for the formal review of restraint found in MCM 1984, RCM 305, and AFI 51-201, Military Justice Guide,2 does not apply.
