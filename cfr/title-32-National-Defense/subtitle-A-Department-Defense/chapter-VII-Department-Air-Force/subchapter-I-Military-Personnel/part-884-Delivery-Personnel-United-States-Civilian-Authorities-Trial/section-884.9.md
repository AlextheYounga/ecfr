##### ยง 884.9 Requests for custody of members stationed outside the United States. #####

(a) Authority. This section implements Pub. L. 100-456, section 721(a), and DoD Directive 5525.9, December 27, 1988.

(b) The Air Force expects members to comply with orders issued by Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction, unless noncompliance is legally justified. Air Force members who persist in noncompliance are subject to adverse administrative action, including separation for cause under AFI 36-3206, Administrative Discharge Procedures, and AFI 36-3208, Administrative Separation of Airmen.

(c) Air Force officials will ensure that members do not use assignments or officially sponsored residence outside the United States to avoid compliance with valid orders of Federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.

(d) Noncompliance with a court order may be legally justified when the individual can adequately demonstrate that the conduct, which is the subject of the complaint or request, was sanctioned by supplemental court orders, equally valid court orders of other jurisdictions, good faith legal efforts to resist the request, or other reasons. HQ USAF/JAG, HQ AFLSA/JACA, and Air Force legal offices in the jurisdiction concerned will provide legal support to servicing staff judge advocates who request assistance in reviewing these issues.

(e) When Federal, state, or local authorities request delivery of an Air Force member stationed outside the United States who is convicted of or charged with a felony or other serious offense or who is sought by such authorities in connection with the unlawful or contemptuous taking of a child from the jurisdiction of a court or from the lawful custody of another person, the member's commander will normally expeditiously return the member to the United States for delivery to the requesting authorities.

(1) A serious offense is defined as one punishable by confinement for more than 1 year under the laws of the requesting jurisdiction.

(2) Delivery of the member is not required if the controversy can be resolved without returning the member to the United States or if the request for delivery of the member is denied in accordance with this instruction.

(f) Ordinarily, do not return an Air Force member stationed outside the United States to the United States for delivery to civilian authorities if the offense is not specified in paragraph (e) of this section. TJAG may direct return when deemed appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.

(g) Before taking action under this section, give the member the opportunity to provide evidence of legal efforts to resist the court order or process sought to be enforced or otherwise to show legitimate cause for noncompliance.4
