##### ยง 884.13 Denials of a request for return of a member to the United States. #####

(a) A request for return of a member to the United States for delivery to civilian authorities may be denied when:

(1) The member's return would have an adverse impact on operational readiness or mission requirements.

(2) An international agreement precludes the member's return.

(3) The member is the subject of foreign judicial proceedings, court-martial, or a DoD, Air Force, or other military department investigation.

(4) The member showed satisfactory evidence of legal efforts to resist the request or other legitimate cause for noncompliance or when other unusual facts or circumstances warrant a denial.

(b) Commanders promptly send to HQ AFLSA/JAJM information supporting a determination that denial may be appropriate. In cases warranting denial, TJAG promptly sends a recommendation and supporting documentation, through SAF/GC and SAF/MI, to USD/P&R for decision.

(c) The fact that a recommendation for denial is pending does not by itself authorize noncompliance or a delay in compliance with any provision of this section, but TJAG may consider a pending request for denial in determining whether to grant a delay.
