1. You are being delivered to the custody of civilian authorities, pursuant to the provisions of AFI 51-1001. This action does not constitute a discharge from the Air Force.

Advise the commander of your name, rank, SSN, organization, the circumstances of your release from custody, and the contents of this letter.

If that is not possible, request the nearest Air Force base military personnel flight to contact HQ AFPC/DPMARS or DPMRPP2 by the fastest means available. Provide your name, rank, SSN, organization, and the circumstances of your release; further instruction will then be given to you.
