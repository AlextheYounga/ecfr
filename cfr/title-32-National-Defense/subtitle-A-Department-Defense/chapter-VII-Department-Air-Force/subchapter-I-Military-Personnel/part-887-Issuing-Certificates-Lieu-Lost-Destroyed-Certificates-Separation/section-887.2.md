##### § 887.2 Safeguarding certificates. #####

Certificates of separation are important personal documents. Processing applications for CILs is costly to the Air Force. To keep requests for CILs at a minimum:

(a) Personnel officers will tell members of the importance of safeguarding the original certificates.

(b) Persons who issue CILs will type or stamp across the lower margin “THIS IS AN IMPORTANT RECORD - SAFEGUARD IT” (if it is not printed on the certificate).

Note:

Do not show this legend on DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement.
