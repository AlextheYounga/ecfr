(a) Markings. Record owners may also add the following sentence to the statement above: “(Further distribution is prohibited without the approval of (owner's organization, office symbol, phone).)”

(b) Dissemination and transmission. (1) When deciding whether to send FOUO records over facsimile equipment, balance the sensitivity of the records against the risk of disclosure. When faxing, use cover sheets to indicate FOUO attachments (*i.e.,* AF Form 3227, Privacy Act Cover Sheet, for Privacy Act information). Consider the location of sending and receiving machines and ensure authorized personnel are available to receive FOUO information as soon as it is transmitted.

(2) For Privacy Act records, refer to AFI 33-332 for specific disclosure rules. For releases to GAO and Congress, refer to AFI 90-401, Air Force Relations With Congress and AFI 65-401, Relations With the General Accounting Office. See § 806.9(b) for availability.

(c) Termination, disposal and unauthorized disclosures. You may recycle FOUO material. Safeguard the FOUO documents or information to prevent unauthorized disclosure until recycling. Recycling contracts must include specific responsibilities and requirements on protecting and destroying FOUO and Privacy Act materials.
