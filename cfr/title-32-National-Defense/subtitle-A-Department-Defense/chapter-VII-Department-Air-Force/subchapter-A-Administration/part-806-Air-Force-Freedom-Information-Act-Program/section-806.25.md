##### § 806.25 Annual report. #####

(a) MAJCOM FOIA managers and AFLSA/JACL send a consolidated report for the fiscal year on DD Form 2564, Annual Report Freedom of Information Act, to HQ AFCIC/ITC by October 30 via regular mail, e-mail, or facsimile. AFLSA/JACL will prepare the appeals and litigation costs sections of the report. HQ AFCIC/ITC will make the Air Force report available on the WWW.

(b) Total requests processed. “Processed” includes responses that give an estimated cost for providing the records, even if the requester has not paid.

(c) Denied in full. Do not report “no record” responses as denials.

(d) Other reasons.

(1) *Referrals.* Also include referrals within Air Force in this category.

(2) *Not an agency record.* The “not an agency record” other reason category only applies to requests for: objects or articles such as structures, furniture, vehicles and equipment, whatever their historical value, or value as evidence; anything that is not a tangible or documentary record such as an individual's memory or oral communication; and personal records of an individual not subject to agency creation or retention requirements, created and maintained primarily for the convenience of an agency employee and not distributed to other agency employees for their official use. This category does not include “no record” responses.

(e) Other. The “Other (Specify)” block must contain the reason with the total number for the reason. For example: “FOIA request had no return address-4.”

(f) 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) statutes invoked on initial determinations. A corresponding statute is required for each instance entered in the Exemption 3 block. List the statute by number, not title. For any statute on the report that is not on DoD's list of commonly used 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) statutes, attach a copy of the pertinent page of the statute that states information must be withheld from public disclosure. HQ AFCIC/ITC makes the DoD list available to FOIA managers electronically. Statutes on the DoD list with an asterisk indicate they are valid 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) statutes from litigation. Do not enter any of the following as 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3) statutes:

5 U.S.C. 5525 U.S.C. 552a28 U.S.C. 149817 U.S.C. 10118 U.S.C. 1905.

(g) Appeal determinations. Enter the total number of FOIA appeals received and total number of FOIA appeals completed during the fiscal year.

(h) Average. Air Force will use the “median age” and will not collect or report averages.

(i) Number of initial requests received during the fiscal year. This number includes open and closed cases.

(j) Total number of initial requests. “Processed” includes responses which give an estimated cost for providing the records, even if the requester has not paid.

(k) Total program cost. This figure includes all costs from the DD Forms 2086 and 2086-1, as well as personnel costs for individuals primarily involved in administering the FOIA program. To figure personnel costs, multiply the annual salary of each person by the percentage of time spent on FOIA.

(l) MAJCOMs and bases do not include the 25 percent. HQ AFCIC/ITC will add to the final Air Force report to DoD.

(m) Authentication. MAJCOM SCs will sign as approving official (or two-letter functional equivalent for FOIA offices in other functional areas).
