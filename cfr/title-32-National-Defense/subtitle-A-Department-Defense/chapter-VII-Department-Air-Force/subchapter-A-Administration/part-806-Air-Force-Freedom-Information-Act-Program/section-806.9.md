##### ยง 806.9 Referrals. #####

(a) Send all referrals through the FOIA office. The receiving FOIA office must agree to accept the referral before transfer. The FOIA office will provide the name, phone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of both the FOIA office point of contact and the record OPR point of contact in their referral letter. Include the requested record. If the requested records are massive, then provide a description of them. Referrals to, or consultations with, DFOISR are accomplished from the MAJCOM level. Section 806.27 has an example of a referral memo.

(b) In some cases, requested records are available from the GPO and NTIS, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield VA 22161. These organizations offer certain records for sale to the public. Current standard releasable Air Force publications are available electronically on the WWW at *http://afpubs.hq.af.mil/.* For requesters without electronic access, NTIS has paper copies for sale. Give requesters the web address or NTIS address when appropriate. However, if the requester prefers to pursue the FOIA process, consult with HQ AFCIC/ITC through the MAJCOM. Refer FOIA requests for Air Force publications that are classified, FOUO, rescinded, or superseded to the OPR through the appropriate FOIA office.
