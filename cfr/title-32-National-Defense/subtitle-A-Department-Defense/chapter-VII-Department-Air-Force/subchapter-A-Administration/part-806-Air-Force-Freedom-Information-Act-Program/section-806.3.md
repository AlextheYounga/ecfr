##### § 806.3 Public information. #####

(a) *Functional requests.* Air Force elements may receive requests for government information or records from the public that do not refer to the FOIA. Often these requests are sent to a public affairs office (PAO) or a specific unit. All releases of information from Air Force records, whether the requester cites the FOIA or not, must comply with the principles of the FOIA and this part. If the requested material contains personal privacy information that the Air Force must withhold, it is particularly important to handle that “functional” request as a request under the FOIA and coordinate it with the appropriate FOIA office and an Air Force attorney. Regardless of the nature of the functional request, if the responding element denies the release of information from Air Force records, then control the request as a FOIA and follow FOIA denial procedures for records withheld (cite the pertinent FOIA exemption and give the requester FOIA appeal rights).

(b) HQ AFCIC/ITC will make the Air Force handbook and guide for requesting records available on the World Wide Web (WWW) from Air ForceLINK, at *http://www.foia.af.mil/handbook.htm.*
