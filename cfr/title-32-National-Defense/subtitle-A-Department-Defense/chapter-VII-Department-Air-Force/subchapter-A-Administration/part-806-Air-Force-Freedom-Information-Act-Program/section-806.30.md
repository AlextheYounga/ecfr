##### § 806.30 FOIA exempt information examples. #####

(a) Certain responsive records may contain parts that are releasable, along with other parts that the Air Force must withhold from release. Carefully delete information exempt from release under the FOIA from copies of otherwise releasable records. Do not release copies that would permit the requester to “read through the marking.” In order to assist FOIA managers in redacting records, selected items appropriate to withhold in commonly requested Air Force records are illustrated below. When providing releasable portions from classified paragraphs, line through and do not delete, the classification marking preceding the paragraph.

(b) Exemption 1. Example used is an extract from a “simulated” contingency plan (all information below is fictional and UNCLASSIFIED; parenthetical information and marking is used for illustrative purposes only).

(U) Air Force members will safeguard all FELLOW YELLOW data (NOTE: FELLOW YELLOW simulates an UNCLASSIFIED code name).

During the contingency deployment in Shambala, those members assigned to force element FELLOW YELLOW will cover their movements by employing specified camouflage and concealment activities while behind enemy lines. Only secure communications of limited duration as specified in the communications annex will be employed until FELLOW YELLOW personnel return to base. (Exemption 1)

(c) Exemption 2. Example used is an extract from a “simulated” test administration guide (all information below is fictional and is used for illustrative purposes only).

When administering the test to determine which technicians are ranked fully qualified, make sure to allow only the time specified in HQ AETC Pamphlet XYZ, which the technicians were permitted to review as part of their test preparation. For ease in scoring this exam, correct answers are A, A, B, B, A, B, C, C, A, B, D, D, C, C, C, D; the corresponding template for marking the standard answer sheet is kept locked up at all times when not in use to grade answer sheets. (Exemption “high” 2)

(d) Exemption 5. Example used is a simulated IG Report of Investigation (ROI) recommendation. All parenthetical information in this example is fictional and is used for illustrative purposes only:

Having interviewed the appropriate personnel and having reviewed the appropriate documents, I recommend additional training sessions for all branch personnel on accepted Air Force standards, and the Air Force pursue administrative or judicial disciplinary action with respect to Terry Hardcase. (Exemption 5)

(e) Exemption 6. Example used is a simulated personnel computer report on a military member selected for a special assignment (all information below is fictional; information and marking is used for illustrative purposes only.):

(f) Exemption 7. Example used is summary of a law enforcement report on a domestic disturbance at on-base family housing (all information below is fictional and all parenthetical information is used for illustrative purposes only):

At 2140, the law enforcement desk, extension 222-3456, took an anonymous call that reported a disturbance at 1234 Basestreet, quarters allegedly occupied by two military members. SrA Patrolman (names of law enforcement investigators usually are withheld under Exemptions 6 and 7(C)) arrived on the scene at 2155. SrA Patrolman met Nora Neighbor, (names of witnesses usually are withheld under Exemptions 6 and 7(C)) who was very agitated. Because she feared her neighbors would retaliate against her if they knew she reported their fight, she asked that her name not be released before she would talk. After she was promised her identity would remain anonymous, she stated: (Nora Neighbor became a confidential informant; data that could identify her, and in some cases, the information she related, should be withheld from release under Exemptions 6, 7(C) and (D).) “I heard cursing and heard furniture and dishes breaking. They fight all the time. I've seen Betty Battle (unless Betty is the requester, redact her name Exemptions 6 and 7(C)) with a black eye, and I also saw Bob Battle (unless Bob is the requester, redact his name Exemptions 6 and 7(C)) with bruises the day after they had their last fight, last Saturday night. This time, there was a tremendous crash; I heard a man scream “My Lord NO!” then I saw Betty Battle come out of the house with dark stains on her clothes - she got into her car and drove away. I could see this really well, because the streetlight is right between our houses; I'm the wife of their NCOIC. If only Nick, my husband, was here now, he'd know what to do! I haven't heard anything from Bob Battle.” (Exemptions 6 and 7)
