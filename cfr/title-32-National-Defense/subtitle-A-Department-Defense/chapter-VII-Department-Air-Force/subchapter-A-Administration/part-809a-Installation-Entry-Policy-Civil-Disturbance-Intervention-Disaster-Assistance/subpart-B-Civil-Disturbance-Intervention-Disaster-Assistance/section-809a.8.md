##### ยง 809a.8 Installation policies and laws. #####

This subpart contains policies on the use of Air Force military personnel in civil disturbances and disasters. The more important laws concerning military aid to civil authorities are also summarized.

(a) The Air Force gives military assistance to civil authorities in civil defense or civil disturbances and disasters only when such assistance is requested or directed. Commanders will not undertake such assistance without authority, unless the overruling demands of humanity compel immediate action to protect life and property and to restore order.

(b) The military service having available resources nearest the affected area is responsible for providing initial assistance to civil authorities in emergencies. Subsequent operations are to be according to the mutual agreement between the senior service commanders concerned.

(c) The protection of life and property and the maintenance of law and order within the territorial jurisdiction of any State is the primary responsibility of State and local authorities. It is well-established U.S. Government policy that intervention with military forces takes place only after State and local authorities have used their own forces and are unable to control the situation, or when they do not take appropriate action.
