##### ยง 809a.9 Conditions for use of Air Force resources. #####

This part is not intended to extend Air Force responsibilities in emergencies to generate additional resources (manpower, materiel, facilities, etc.) requirements, or encourage participation in such operations at the expense of the Air Force primary mission. It is a guide for the employment of Air Force resources when:

(a) A disaster or disturbance occurs in areas in which the U.S. Air Force is the executive agent of the United States.

(b) A disaster or disturbance occurs in areas that are remote from an Army installation but near an Air Force installation, thereby necessitating Air Force assumption of responsibility pending arrival of Army personnel.

(c) The overriding demand of conditions resulting from a natural disaster compels immediate action to protect life and property and to restore order.
