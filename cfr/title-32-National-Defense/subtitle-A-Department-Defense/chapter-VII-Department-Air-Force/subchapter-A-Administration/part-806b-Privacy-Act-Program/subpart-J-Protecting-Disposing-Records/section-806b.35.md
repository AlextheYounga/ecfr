##### ยง 806b.35 Balancing protection. #####

Balance additional protection against sensitivity, risk and cost. In some situations, a password may be enough protection for an automated system with a log-on protocol. Others may require more sophisticated security protection based on the sensitivity of the information. Classified computer systems or those with established audit and password systems are obviously less vulnerable than unprotected files. Follow Air Force Instruction 33-202, *Computer Security*,5 for procedures on safeguarding personal information in automated records.
