##### ยง 806b.23 Approving or denying a record amendment. #####

The Air Force does not usually amend a record when the change is based on opinion, interpretation, or subjective official judgment. Determinations not to amend such records constitutes a denial, and requesters may appeal (*see* subpart F of this part).

(a) If the system manager decides not to amend the record, send a copy of the request, the record, and the recommended denial reasons to the denial authority through the legal office and the Privacy Act office. Legal offices will include a written legal opinion. The Privacy Act officer reviews the proposed denial and legal opinion and makes a recommendation to the denial authority.

(b) The denial authority sends the requester a letter with the decision. If the denial authority approves the request, amend the record and notify all previous recipients that it has been changed. If the authority denies the request, give the requester the statutory authority, reason, and pertinent appeal rights (see subpart F of this part).
