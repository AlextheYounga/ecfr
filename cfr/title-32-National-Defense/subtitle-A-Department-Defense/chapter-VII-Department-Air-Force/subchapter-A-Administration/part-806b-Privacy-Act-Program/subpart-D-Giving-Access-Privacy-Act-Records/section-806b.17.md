##### ยง 806b.17 Special provision for certain medical records. #####

If a physician believes that disclosing requested medical records could harm the person's mental or physical health, you should:

(a) Ask the requester to get a letter from a physician to whom you can send the records. Include a letter explaining to the physician that giving the records directly to the individual could be harmful.

(b) Offer the services of a military physician other than one who provided treatment if naming the physician poses a hardship on the individual.

(c) The Privacy Act requires that we ultimately insure that the subject receives the records.
