##### ยง 806b.43 Placing personal information on shared drives. #####

Personal information should never be placed on shared drives for access by groups of individuals unless each person has an official need to know the information to perform their job. Add appropriate access controls to ensure access by only authorized individuals. Recall rosters are FOUO because they contain personal information and should be shared with small groups at the lowest levels for official purposes to reduce the number of people with access to such personal information. Commanders and supervisors should give consideration to those individuals with unlisted phone numbers, who do not want their number included on the office recall roster. In those instances, disclosure to the Commander or immediate supervisor, or deputy, should normally be sufficient.
