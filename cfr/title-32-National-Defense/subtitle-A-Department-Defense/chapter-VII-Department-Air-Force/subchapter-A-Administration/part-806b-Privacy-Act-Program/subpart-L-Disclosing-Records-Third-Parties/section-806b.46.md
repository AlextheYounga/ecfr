##### ยง 806b.46 Disclosing other information. #####

Use these guidelines to decide whether to release information:

(a) Would the subject have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the information requested?

(b) Would disclosing the information benefit the general public? The Air Force considers information as meeting the public interest standard if it reveals anything regarding the operations or activities of the agency, or performance of its statutory duties.

(c) Balance the public interest against the individual's probable loss of privacy. Do *not* consider the requester's purpose, circumstances, or proposed use.
