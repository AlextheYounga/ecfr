##### § 806b.41 Disclosure considerations. #####

The Privacy Act requires the written consent of the subject before releasing personal information to third parties, unless one of the 12 exceptions of the Privacy Act applies (see § 806b.47). Use this checklist before releasing personal information to third parties: Make sure it is authorized under the Privacy Act; consider the consequences; and check the accuracy of the information. You can release personal information to third parties when the subject agrees in writing. Air Force members consent to releasing their home telephone number and address when they sign and check the “Do Consent” block on the AF Form 624, Base/Unit Locator and Postal Service Center Directory7(see Air Force Instruction 33-329, *Base and Unit Personnel Locators*8).
