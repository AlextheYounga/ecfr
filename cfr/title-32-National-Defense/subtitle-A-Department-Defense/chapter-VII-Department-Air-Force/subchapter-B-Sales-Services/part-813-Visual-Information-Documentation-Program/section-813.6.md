##### ยง 813.6 Planning and requesting combat documentation. #####

(a) *Planned combat documentation.* Air components identify documentation needs as early as possible in OPLANs, CONPLANs, and OPORDs and send copies of these plans to HQ AMC/SCMV, 203 West Losey Street, Room 3180, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5223. Include the contact for planning and support.

(b) *Activity documentation.* MAJCOMs may request that HQ AMC document their activities. Send information copies of requests to HQ AFCIC/ITSM, 1250 Air Force Pentagon, Washington, DC 20330-1250, and HQ AMC/SCMV. When a supporting component command operationally controls HQ AMC COMCAM units, other organizations that need support must coordinate requests with the supported command.

(c) *Unplanned combat documentation.* Send short notice requests to the supported operational commander as soon as possible, with information copies to HQ AFCIC/ITSM and HQ AMC/SCMO. Identify end product requirements, media formats, and deadlines.

(d) *Humanitarian, disaster relief, and contingencies.* Theater commanders normally task the supporting component through the Joint Operation Planning and Execution System, that in turn, requests support from HQ AMC. HQ USAF can directly task HQ AMC to document humanitarian, disaster relief, or contingency activities if it does not receive other tasking(s). In these cases, coordinate with the supported unified command.
