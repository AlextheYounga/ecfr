##### ยง 307.20 Partial liquidation; liquidation upon termination. #####

(a) *Partial liquidation or disallowance of a portion of an RLF Grant.* If the RLF Recipient engages in certain problematic practices, EDA may disallow a corresponding proportion of the Grant or direct the RLF Recipient to transfer loans to an RLF Third Party for liquidation. Problematic practices for which EDA may disallow a portion of an RLF Grant and recover the pro-rata Federal Share (as defined in ยง 314.5 of this chapter) include the RLF Recipient:

(1) Having RLF loans that are more than 120 days delinquent;

(2) Having excess cash sequestered for 12 months or longer and EDA has not approved an extension request;

(3) Making an ineligible loan;

(4) Failing to disburse the EDA funds in accordance with the time schedule prescribed in the RLF Grant; or

(5) Determining that it does not wish to further invest in the RLF or cannot maintain operations at the degree originally contemplated upon receipt of the RLF Grant and requests that a portion of the RLF Grant be disallowed, and EDA agrees to allow the disallowance.

(b) *Liquidation upon termination.* When EDA approves the termination of an RLF Grant, EDA may assign or transfer assets of the RLF to an RLF Third Party for liquidation.

(c) *Terms.* The following terms will govern any liquidation:

(1) EDA shall have sole discretion in choosing the RLF Third Party;

(2) The RLF Third Party may be an Eligible Applicant or a for-profit organization not otherwise eligible for Investment Assistance;

(3) EDA may enter into an agreement with the RLF Third Party to liquidate the assets of one or more RLFs or RLF Recipients;

(4) EDA may allow the RLF Third Party to retain a portion of the RLF assets, consistent with the agreement referenced in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, as reasonable compensation for services rendered in the liquidation; and

(5) EDA may require additional reasonable terms and conditions.

(d) *Distribution of proceeds.* The proceeds resulting from any liquidation upon termination shall be distributed in the following order of priority:
