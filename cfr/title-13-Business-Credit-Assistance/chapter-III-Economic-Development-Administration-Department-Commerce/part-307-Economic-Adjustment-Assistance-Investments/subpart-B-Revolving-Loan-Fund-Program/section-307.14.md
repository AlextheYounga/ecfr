(a) *Frequency of reports.* All RLF Recipients, including those receiving Recapitalization Grants for existing RLFs, must complete and submit a semi-annual report in electronic format, unless EDA approves a paper submission.

(b) *Report contents.* RLF Recipients must certify as part of the semi-annual report to EDA that the RLF is operating in accordance with the applicable RLF Plan. RLF Recipients also must describe (and propose pursuant to § 307.9) any modifications to the RLF Plan to ensure effective use of the RLF as a strategic financing tool.

(c) *RLF Income and Expense Statement.* An RLF Recipient using either 50 percent or more (or more than $100,000) of RLF Income for administrative costs in a six-month Reporting Period must submit to EDA a completed Income and Expense Statement (Form ED-209I or any successor form) for that Reporting Period in electronic format, unless EDA approves a paper submission.
