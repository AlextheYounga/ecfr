Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 57060, Dec. 1, 2017.

(a) Except as provided in §§ 314.3 (regarding the authorized use of Property) or 314.10 (regarding the release of EDA's interest in certain Property), or as otherwise authorized by EDA, the Federal government must be compensated by the Recipient for the Federal Share whenever, during the Estimated Useful Life of the Project, any Property acquired or improved in whole or in part with Investment Assistance is Disposed of, encumbered, or no longer used for the purpose of the Project; provided that for equipment and supplies, the requirements at 15 CFR parts 14 or 24, as applicable, including any supplements or amendments thereto, shall apply.

(b) Additionally, prior to the release of EDA's interest, Real Property or tangible Personal Property acquired or improved with EDA Investment Assistance may not be used:

(1) In violation of the nondiscrimination requirements of § 302.20 of this chapter or in violation of the terms and conditions of the Investment Assistance; or

(2) For any purpose prohibited by applicable law.

(c) Where the Disposition, encumbrance or use of any Property violates paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, EDA may assert its interest in the Property to recover the Federal Share for the Federal government and may take such actions as authorized by PWEDA and this chapter, including the actions provided in §§ 302.3, 302.16, and 307.21 of this chapter. EDA may pursue its rights under paragraph (a) of this section and this paragraph (c) to recover the Federal Share, plus costs and interest. When the Federal government is fully compensated for the Federal Share, the Federal Interest is extinguished as provided in § 314.2(b), and EDA will have no further interest in the ownership, use or Disposition of the Property.
