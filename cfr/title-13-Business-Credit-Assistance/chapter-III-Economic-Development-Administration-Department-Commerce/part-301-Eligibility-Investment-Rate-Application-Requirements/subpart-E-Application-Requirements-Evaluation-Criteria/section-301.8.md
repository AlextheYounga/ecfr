##### § 301.8 Application evaluation criteria. #####

EDA will screen all applications for the feasibility of the budget presented and conformance with EDA's statutory and regulatory requirements. EDA will assess the economic development needs of the affected Region in which the proposed Project will be located (or will service), as well as the capability of the Eligible Applicant to implement the proposed Project. In addition to criteria set out in the applicable FFO, EDA will consider the degree to which an Investment in the proposed Project will satisfy one or more of the following criteria:

(a) *Ensures collaborative Regional innovation.* The Investment will support the development and growth of innovation clusters based on existing Regional competitive strengths. Such initiatives must engage stakeholders; facilitate collaboration among urban, suburban, and rural (including Tribal) areas; provide stability for economic development through long-term intergovernmental and public/private collaboration; and support the growth of existing and emerging industries.

(b) *Leverages public-private partnerships.* The Investment will use both public and private sector resources and leverage complementary investments by other government/public entities or non-profit organizations.

(c) *Advances national strategic priorities.* The Investment will encourage job growth and business expansion in clean energy; green technologies; sustainable manufacturing; information technology infrastructure; communities severely impacted by automotive industry restructuring; natural disaster mitigation and resiliency; access to capital for small- and medium-sized and ethnically diverse enterprises; and innovations in science, health care, and alternative fuel technologies.

(d) *Enhances global competitiveness.* The Investment will support high-growth businesses and innovation-based entrepreneurs to expand and compete in global markets.

(e) *Encourages environmentally sustainable development.* The Investment will encompass best practices in “environmentally sustainable development,” broadly defined to include projects that enhance environmental quality and develop and implement green products, processes, and buildings as part of the green economy.

(f) *Supports economically distressed and underserved communities.* The Investment will strengthen diverse communities that have suffered disproportionate economic and job losses or are rebuilding to become more competitive in the global economy.
