(c) *Affirmative determination petition requirements.* (1) The Community must submit a complete petition to the applicable regional office (or regional offices in the event the Community crosses multiple geographic boundaries) serving the geographic area in which the Community is located. A complete petition for an affirmative determination shall contain the following:

(i) The ‘*Application for Federal Assistance’* (Form SF-424) that contains such information to allow EDA to determine that the petitioning Community is significantly affected by the threat to, or the loss of, jobs associated with one or more Cognizable Certifications;

EDA shall measure such impact(s) using the petitioning Community's most recent Civilian Labor Force statistics as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, effective at the time of petition for affirmative determination. EDA will obtain the applicable Cognizable Certification from publicly available resources. However, a petitioning Community may also provide copies of the applicable Cognizable Certification to EDA.

(d) *Notification to Community.* Upon making an affirmative determination, EDA shall notify promptly the Community and the Governor of the State in which the Community is located of the means for obtaining assistance under this part and other appropriate economic assistance that may be available to the Community. Such notification will identify the appropriate EDA regional office that will provide technical assistance under § 313.5.
