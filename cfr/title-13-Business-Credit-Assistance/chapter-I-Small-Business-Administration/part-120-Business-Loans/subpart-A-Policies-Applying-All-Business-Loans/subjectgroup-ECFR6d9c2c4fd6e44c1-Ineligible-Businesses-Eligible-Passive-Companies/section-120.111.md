##### ยง 120.111 What conditions must an Eligible Passive Company satisfy? #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 39502, Aug. 21, 2017.

An Eligible Passive Company must use loan proceeds to acquire or lease, and/or improve or renovate, real or personal property (including eligible refinancing), that it leases to one or more Operating Companies for conducting the Operating Company's business (references to Operating Company in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section mean each Operating Company). Any ownership structure or legal form may qualify as an Eligible Passive Company.

(a) Conditions that apply to all legal forms:

(1) The Operating Company must be an eligible small business, and the proposed use of the proceeds must be an eligible use if the Operating Company were obtaining the financing directly;

(2) The Eligible Passive Company (with the exception of a trust) and the Operating Company each must be small under the appropriate size standards in part 121 of this chapter;

(3) The lease between the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company must be in writing and must be subordinated to SBA's mortgage, trust deed lien, or security interest on the property. Also, the Eligible Passive Company (as landlord) must furnish as collateral for the loan an assignment of all rents paid under the lease;

(4) The lease between the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company, including options to renew exercisable solely by the Operating Company, must have a remaining term at least equal to the term of the loan;

(5) The Operating Company must be a guarantor or co-borrower with the Eligible Passive Company. In a 7(a) loan that includes working capital and/or the purchase of other assets, including intangible assets, for the Operating Company's use, the Operating Company must be a co-borrower.

(6) Each holder of an ownership interest constituting at least 20 percent of the Eligible Passive Company and the Operating Company must guarantee the loan (the trustee shall execute the guarantee on behalf of any trust).

(b) *Additional conditions that apply to trusts.* The eligibility status of the trustor will determine trust eligibility. All donors to the trust will be deemed to have trustor status for eligibility purposes. A trust qualifying as an Eligible Passive Company may engage in other activities as authorized by its trust agreement. The trustee must warrant and certify that the trust will not be revoked or substantially amended for the term of the loan without the consent of SBA. The trustor must guarantee the loan. For purposes of this section, the trustee shall certify to SBA that:

(1) The trustee has authority to act;

(2) The trust has the authority to borrow funds, pledge trust assets, and lease the property to the Operating Company;

(3) The trustee has provided accurate, pertinent language from the trust agreement confirming the above; and

(4) The trustee has provided and will continue to provide SBA with a true and complete list of all trustors and donors.
