SBA, in its discretion, consulting with the Participating Lender, may require other appropriate individuals to guarantee the loan as well, except SBA will not require personal guarantees from those owning less than 5% ownership.

(b) *Appraisals.* SBA may require professional appraisals of the applicant's and principals' assets, a survey, or a feasibility study.

(c) *Hazard Insurance.* SBA requires hazard insurance on all collateral.

(d) *Taxes.* The applicant may not use any of the proceeds to pay past-due Federal and state payroll taxes.
