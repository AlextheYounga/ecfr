##### § 120.441 How does a Lender become a CLP Lender? #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 39503, Aug. 21, 2017.

(a) An SBA field office may nominate a Lender or a Lender may request a field office to consider it for CLP status. SBA district directors may approve and renew a Lender's CLP status. The district director will consider whether the Lender:

(1) Has the ability to process, close, service and liquidate loans;

(2) Has a satisfactory performance history with SBA, including the submission of complete and accurate loan guarantee application packages;

(3) Has an acceptable SBA purchase rate; and

(4) Has shown the ability to work well with the local SBA office.

(b) If the district director does not approve a request for CLP status, the Lender may appeal to the D/FA, whose decision will be final. If SBA grants CLP status, it applies only in the field office that processed the CLP designation. A CLP Lender must execute a Supplemental Guarantee Agreement that will specify a term not to exceed two years.
