##### § 120.440 How does a 7(a) Lender obtain delegated authority? #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 80588, Dec. 14, 2020.

(a) In making its decision to grant or renew a delegated authority, SBA considers whether the Lender, as determined by SBA in its discretion:

(1) Has the continuing ability to evaluate, process, close, disburse, service, liquidate and litigate SBA loans. This includes the ability to develop and analyze complete loan packages. SBA may consider the experience and capability of Lender's management and staff.

(2) Has satisfactory SBA performance (as defined in § 120.410(a)(2));

(3) Is in compliance with SBA Loan Program Requirements (*e.g.,* Form 1502 reporting, timely payment of all fees to SBA);

(4) Has completed to SBA's satisfaction all required corrective actions;

(5) Whether Lender is subject to any enforcement action, order or agreement with a regulator or the presence of other regulatory concerns as determined by SBA; and

(6) Whether Lender exhibits other risk factors (*e.g.,* has rapid growth; low SBA activity; SBA loan volume; Lender, an officer or director is under investigation or indictment).

(b) Delegated authority decisions are made by the appropriate SBA official in accordance with Delegations of Authority, and are final.

(c) If delegated authority is approved or renewed, Lender must execute a supplemental guarantee agreement, which will specify a term not to exceed two years. As provided in § 120.442(c)(2)(i), when SBA renews a Lender's authority to participate in SBA Express, SBA may grant a longer term, but not to exceed three years. For approval or renewal of any delegated authority, SBA may grant shortened approvals or renewals based on risk or any of the other delegated authority criteria. Lenders with less than three years of SBA lending experience will be limited to an initial term of one year or less.
