##### § 120.400 Loan Guarantee Agreements. #####

SBA may enter into a Loan Guarantee Agreement with a Lender to make deferred participation (guaranteed) loans. Such an agreement does not obligate SBA to participate in any specific proposed loan that a Lender may submit. The existence of a Loan Guarantee Agreement does not limit SBA's rights to deny a specific loan or establish general policies. *See also* §§ 120.441(b) and 120.451(d) concerning Supplemental Guarantee Agreements.
