##### ยง 120.443 SBA Express and Export Express loan processing requirements. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 80588, Dec. 14, 2020.

(a) SBA Express and Export Express loans are subject to all of the requirements set forth in subparts A and B of this part, unless such requirements are specifically identified by SBA as inapplicable.

(b) In addition to the eligibility criteria applicable to all 7(a) loans, an Export Express Applicant must have been in business for at least 12 full months at the time of application, but not necessarily in the exporting business, unless the Lender determines that the Applicant's key personnel have clearly demonstrated export expertise and substantial previous successful business experience and the Lender processes the Export Express loan using conventional commercial loan underwriting procedures and does not rely solely on credit scoring or credit matrices to approve the loan.

(c) Certain types of loans and loan programs are not eligible for SBA Express or Export Express, as detailed in official SBA policy and procedures, including but not limited to:

(1) A loan that would reduce the Lender's existing credit exposure to a single Borrower, including its affiliates as defined in ยง 121.301(f) of this chapter;

(2) A loan to a business that has an outstanding 7(a) loan where the Applicant is unable to certify that the loan is current at the time of approval of the SBA Express or Export Express loan;

(3) A loan that would have as its primary collateral real estate or personal property that does not meet SBA's environmental requirements; and

(4) Complex loan structures or eligibility situations.

(d) SBA has authorized SBA Express and Export Express Lenders to make the credit decision without prior SBA review. Lenders must not make an SBA-guaranteed loan that would be available on reasonable terms from either the Lender itself or another source without an SBA guaranty in accordance with ยง 120.101. The credit analysis must demonstrate that there is reasonable assurance of repayment. SBA Express and Export Express Lenders must use appropriate and prudent credit analysis processes and procedures that are generally accepted in the commercial lending industry and are consistent with those used for their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. As part of their prudent credit analysis, SBA Express and Export Express Lenders may use a business credit scoring model (such a model cannot rely solely on consumer credit scores) to assess the credit history of the Applicant and/or repayment ability if they do so for their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans. SBA Express and Export Express Lenders must validate (and document) with appropriate statistical methodologies that their credit analysis procedures are predictive of loan performance, and they must provide that documentation to SBA upon request. SBLCs must provide such credit scoring model validation and documentation to SBA for review and approval on an annual basis.

(e) SBA Express and Export Express Lenders are responsible for all loan decisions, including eligibility for 7(a) loans (including size), creditworthiness, and compliance with Loan Program Requirements. SBA Express and Export Express Lenders also are responsible for confirming that all loan closing decisions are correct and that they have complied with all requirements of law and Loan Program Requirements.

(f) SBA Express and Export Express Lenders must ensure all required forms are obtained and are complete and properly executed. Appropriate documentation must be maintained in the Lender's loan file, including adequate information to support the eligibility of the Applicant and the loan.
