SBA Express and Export Express loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as other 7(a) loans except as set forth in this section:

(a) *Maximum loan amount and maximum aggregate loan amount* - (1) *SBA Express.* The maximum loan amount for an SBA Express loan is set forth in section 7(a)(31) of the Small Business Act. The aggregate amount of all outstanding SBA Express loans to a single Borrower, including the Borrower's affiliates as defined in § 121.301(f) of this chapter, must not exceed the statutory maximum.

(2) *Export Express.* The maximum loan amount for an Export Express loan is set forth in section 7(a)(34) of the Small Business Act. The aggregate amount of all outstanding Export Express loans to a single Borrower, including the Borrower's affiliates as defined in § 121.301(f) of this chapter, must not exceed the statutory maximum.

(b) *Maximum SBA guarantee* - (1) *SBA Express.* The maximum SBA guarantee on an SBA Express loan is 50 percent of the SBA Express loan amount. In addition, the guaranteed amount of all SBA Express loans to a single Borrower, including the Borrower's affiliates, counts toward the maximum guaranty amount as described in § 120.151.

(2) *Export Express.* The maximum SBA guarantee on an Export Express loan of $350,000 or less is 90 percent, and for a loan over $350,000 is 75 percent, of the Export Express loan amount. In addition, the guaranteed amount of all Export Express loans to a single Borrower, including the Borrower's affiliates, counts toward the maximum guaranty amount as described in § 120.151.

(c) *Maturity* - (1) *SBA Express.* SBA Express loans must have a stated maturity and the maximum maturities are the same as any other 7(a) loan, except that revolving SBA Express loans are limited to a maximum of 10 years, as described more fully in official SBA policy and procedures.

(2) *Export Express.* Export Express loans must have a stated maturity and the maximum maturities are the same as any other 7(a) loan, except that revolving Export Express loans are limited to a maximum maturity of 7 years, as described more fully in official SBA policy and procedures.

(d) *Interest rates.* (1) For fixed interest rate loans, SBA Express and Export Express Lenders may charge a reasonable fixed interest rate in accordance with § 120.213.

(2) For variable interest rate loans:

(i) SBA Express and Export Express Lenders may charge up to 4.5 percent over the prime rate on loans over $50,000 and up to 6.5 percent over the prime rate for loans of $50,000 or less, regardless of the maturity of the loan. The prime rate will be that which is in effect on the first business day of the month, as printed in a national financial newspaper published each business day.

(ii) SBA Express and Export Express Lenders are not required to use the base rate identified in § 120.214(c). SBA Express and Export Express Lenders may use the same base rate of interest they use on their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, as well as their established change intervals, payment accruals, and other interest rate terms. However, the interest rate must never exceed the maximum allowable interest rate stated in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section. Additionally, the loan may be sold on the Secondary Market only if the base rate is one of the base rates allowed in § 120.214(c).

(3) The amount of interest SBA will pay to a Lender following default of an SBA Express or Export Express loan is capped at the maximum interest rates for the standard 7(a) loan program set forth in §§ 120.213 through 120.215.

(e) *Collateral.* (1) With the exception of paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, to the maximum extent practicable, SBA Express and Export Express Lenders must follow the same collateral policies and procedures that they have established and implemented for their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans, including those concerning identification of collateral. Such policies and procedures must be commercially reasonable and prudent.

(2) SBA may establish a threshold below which SBA Express and Export Express Lenders will not be required to take collateral to secure an SBA Express or Export Express loan. If established, such a threshold will be described more fully in official SBA policy and procedures.

(3) Export Express lines of credit over $25,000 used to support the issuance of a standby letter of credit must have collateral (cash, cash equivalent, or project) that will provide coverage for at least 25 percent of the issued standby letter of credit amount.

(f) *Insurance.* SBA Express and Export Express Lenders must follow the same insurance policies they have established and implemented for their similarly-sized, non-SBA guaranteed commercial loans.

(g) *Sale on the Secondary Market.* SBA Express and Export Express Lenders may sell the guaranteed portion of an SBA Express or Export Express term loan on the Secondary Market under the policies and procedures described in subpart F of this part. SBA Express or Export Express Lenders may not sell the guaranteed portion of an SBA Express or Export Express revolving line of credit on the Secondary Market.

(h) *Loan increases.* With SBA's prior written consent, an SBA Express or Export Express Lender may increase an SBA Express or Export Express loan based on the needs of the Borrower and its credit situation, as further specified in Loan Program Requirements.
