##### § 120.442 Process to obtain or renew SBA Express or Export Express authority. #####

The decision to grant or renew SBA Express or Export Express authority will be made by the appropriate SBA official in accordance with Delegations of Authority and is final. If SBA Express or Export Express authority is approved or renewed, the Lender must execute a supplemental guarantee agreement before the Lender's SBA Express or Export Express authority will become effective.

(a) *Criteria and process for initial approval of SBA Express or Export Express authority.* A Lender that wishes to participate in SBA Express or Export Express must submit a written request to SBA.

(1) *Existing 7(a) Lenders.* In evaluating an existing 7(a) Lender's application for SBA Express or Export Express authority, SBA will consider the criteria and follow the procedures set forth in § 120.440.

(2) *Lending institutions that do not currently participate with SBA.* Lending institutions that do not currently participate with SBA must become 7(a) Lenders to participate in SBA Express and/or Export Express. Such institutions may request SBA 7(a) lending and SBA Express and/or Export Express authority simultaneously. In evaluating such institutions, in addition to the criteria set forth in §§ 120.410 and 120.440, SBA will consider whether the institution:

(i) Has acceptable experience with small commercial loans, including an acceptable number of performing small commercial loans outstanding at its most recent fiscal year end; and

(ii) Has received appropriate training on SBA's policies and procedures.

(b) *Criteria and process for renewal of SBA Express or Export Express authority.* In renewing a Lender's SBA Express or Export Express authority and determining the term of the renewal, SBA will consider the criteria and follow the process set forth in § 120.440 and also will consider whether the Lender:

(1) Can effectively process, make, close, service, and liquidate SBA Express or Export Express loans, as applicable;

(2) Has received a major substantive objection regarding renewal from the Field Office(s) covering the territory where the Lender generates significant numbers of SBA Express or Export Express loans, as applicable; and

(3) Has received acceptable review results on the SBA Express or Export Express portion, as applicable, of any SBA-administered Lender reviews.

(c) *Term* - (1) *Initial approval.* SBA may approve a Lender's authority to participate in SBA Express or Export Express for a maximum term of two years. SBA may approve a shorter term or limit a Lender's maximum SBA Express or Export Express loan volume if, in SBA's sole discretion, a Lender's qualifications, performance, experience with SBA lending, or other factors so warrant.

(2) *Renewal* - (i) *SBA Express.* SBA may renew a Lender's authority to participate in SBA Express for two years or, in SBA's sole discretion, a maximum of three years if a Lender's qualifications, performance, experience with SBA lending, or other factors so warrant.

(ii) *Export Express.* SBA may renew a Lender's authority to participate in Export Express for a maximum term of two years.

(iii) *Shorter term or loan volume limit.* SBA may renew a Lender's authority to participate in SBA Express or Export Express for a shorter term or limit a Lender's maximum SBA Express or Export Express loan volume if, in SBA's sole discretion, a Lender's qualifications, performance, experience with SBA lending, or other factors so warrant.
