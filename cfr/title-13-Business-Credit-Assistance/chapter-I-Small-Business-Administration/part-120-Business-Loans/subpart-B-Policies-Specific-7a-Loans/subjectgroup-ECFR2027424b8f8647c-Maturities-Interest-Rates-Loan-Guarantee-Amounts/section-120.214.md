##### ยง 120.214 What conditions apply for variable interest rates? #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 38908, June 30, 2022.

A Lender may use a variable rate of interest, upon SBA's approval. SBA's maximum allowable rates apply only to the initial rate on the date SBA received the loan application. SBA shall approve the use of a variable interest rate under the following conditions:

(a) *Frequency.* The first change may occur on the first calendar day of the month following initial disbursement, using the base rate (see paragraph (c) of this section) in effect on the first business day of the month. After that, changes may occur no more often than monthly.

(b) *Range of fluctuation.* The amount of fluctuation shall be equal to the movement in the base rate. The difference between the initial rate and the ceiling rate may be no greater than the difference between the initial rate and the floor rate.

(c) *Base rate.* The base rate will be one of the following: (i) The prime rate; (ii) the thirty-day (1-month) London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 3 percentage points, or (iii) the Optional Peg Rate. The prime or LIBOR rate will be that which is in effect on the first business day of the month, as printed in a national financial newspaper published each business day. SBA publishes the Optional Peg Rate quarterly in the Federal Register.

(d) *Maturities under 7 years.* For loans with maturities under seven years, the maximum interest rate shall not exceed two and one-quarter (2 1/4) percentage points over the base rate.

(e) *Maturities of 7 years or more.* For loans with maturities of seven or more years, the maximum interest rate shall not exceed two and three-quarters (2 3/4) percentage points over the base rate.

(f) *Amortization.* Initial amortization of principal and interest may be recomputed and reassessed as interest rates fluctuate, as directed by SBA. With prior approval of SBA, the Lender may use certain other amortization methods, except that SBA does not allow balloon payments.
