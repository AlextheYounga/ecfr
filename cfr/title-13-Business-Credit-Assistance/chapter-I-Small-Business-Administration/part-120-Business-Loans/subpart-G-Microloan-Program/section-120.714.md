SBA selects non-lending technical assistance providers (NTAP) to receive grant funds for technical assistance to Microloan borrowers.

(a) *Grant procedure for non-Intermediaries.* Any nonprofit entity that is not an Intermediary may apply to SBA for a grant to provide marketing, management and technical assistance to low-income individuals for the purpose of assisting them in obtaining private sector financing in amounts of $50,000 or less. To qualify, it must submit information regarding its ability to provide this assistance. If approved, the grant agreement will establish the terms and conditions for the grant.

(b) *Number and amount of grants.* In each year of the Microloan Program, SBA may make no more than 55 grants to non-Intermediaries for terms of up to five years. A grant may not exceed $200,000.

(c) *Contribution by nonprofit entity.* The nonprofit entity must contribute an amount equal to 20 percent of the grant. The contribution from the nonprofit entity must come solely from non-Federal sources, and may include direct costs or in-kind contributions paid for under non-Federal programs.
