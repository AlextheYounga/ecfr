##### § 120.532 What is a loan Moratorium? #####

SBA may assume a Borrower's obligation to repay principal and interest on a loan by agreeing to make the payments to the Lender on behalf of the Borrower under terms and conditions set by SBA. This relief is called a “Moratorium.” Complete information concerning this program may be obtained from local SBA offices.
