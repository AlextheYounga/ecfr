(a) The SISMBD is responsible for all principal and interest payments on an SISMBD Loan. If SBA does not receive full and timely remittances from the Collateral or the SISMBD borrower, SBA may enforce its rights against the SISMBD and the Collateral as set forth in the Loan Agreements, related documents and applicable law.

(b) An SISMBD will have a 30 day grace period during which to make a supplemental payment if remittances from the Collateral are not sufficient to cover the SISMBD Loan payments when they are due. After the grace period, if the loan remains delinquent, SBA may enforce its rights as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.
