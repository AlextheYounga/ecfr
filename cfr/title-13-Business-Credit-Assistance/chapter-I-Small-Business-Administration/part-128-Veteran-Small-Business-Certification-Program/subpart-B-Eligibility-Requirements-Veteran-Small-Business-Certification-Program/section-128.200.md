(a) *Qualification as a VOSB.* To qualify as a VOSB, a business entity must be:

(1) A small business concern as defined in part 121 of this chapter under the size standard corresponding to any NAICS code listed in its SAM profile;

(2) Not less than 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more veterans.

(b) *Qualification as an SDVOSB.* To qualify as an SDVOSB, a business entity must be:

(1) A small business concern as defined in part 121 of this chapter under the size standard corresponding to any NAICS code listed in its SAM profile;

(2) Not less than 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans or, in the case of a veteran with a disability that is rated by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as a permanent and total disability who are unable to manage the daily business operations of such concern, the spouse or permanent caregiver of such veteran.

(c) *VOSB and SDVOSB certification requirement.* (1) A concern must be certified as a VOSB or SDVOSB pursuant to ยง 128.300 in order to be awarded a VOSB or SDVOSB set-aside or sole source contract. Any small business concern that submits a complete certification application to SBA on or before December 31, 2023, shall be eligible to self-certify for SDVOSB sole source or set-aside contracts (other than VA contracts) until SBA declines or approves the concern's application. Any small business concern that does not submit a complete SDVOSB certification application to SBA on or before December 31, 2023, will no longer be eligible to self-certify for SDVOSB sole source or set-aside contracts effective January 1, 2024.

(2) Other small business concerns that meet the eligibility requirements of this part but do not seek SDVOSB set-aside or sole source contracts may continue to self-certify their SDVOSB status, receive prime contract or subcontract awards that are not SDVOSB set-aside or sole source contracts, and count toward an agency's goal for SDVOSB awards.
