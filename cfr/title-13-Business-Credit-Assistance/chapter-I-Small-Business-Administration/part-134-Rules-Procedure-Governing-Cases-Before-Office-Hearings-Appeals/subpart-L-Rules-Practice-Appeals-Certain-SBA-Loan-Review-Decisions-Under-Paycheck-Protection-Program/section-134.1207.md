##### ยง 134.1207 The administrative record. #####

(a) *Contents.* The administrative record shall include relevant documents that SBA considered in making its final decision or that were before SBA at the time of the final decision. The administrative record need not, however, contain all documents pertaining to the appellant. In addition, SBA may claim privilege as to certain materials. The administrative record must be certified and authenticated that it is, to the best of the signatory's knowledge, complete and correct.

(b) *Filing.* SBA will file the administrative record with OHA and serve it on appellant.

(c) *Objection.* The appellant may object to the absence of any document from the administrative record that the appellant believes should have been included in the administrative record. An appellant also may object to any claim that documents in the administrative record are privileged. Such objections must be filed with OHA and served on SBA no later than 10 calendar days after the appellant's receipt of the administrative record. The Judge will rule upon such objections and may direct or permit that the administrative record be supplemented.
