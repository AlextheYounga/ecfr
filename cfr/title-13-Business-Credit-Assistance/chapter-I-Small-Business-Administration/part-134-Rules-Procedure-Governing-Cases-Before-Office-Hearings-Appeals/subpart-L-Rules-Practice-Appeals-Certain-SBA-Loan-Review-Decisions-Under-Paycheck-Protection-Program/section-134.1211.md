##### ยง 134.1211 Alternative dispute resolution. #####

(a) *Joint Motion.* At any time during the pendency of an appeal, the parties may submit a joint motion requesting that the Judge permit the use of alternative dispute resolution to assist in resolving the matter.

(b) *Procedures.* If the motion is granted, the Judge will also stay the proceedings before OHA, in whole or in part, as he or she deems appropriate, pending the outcome of the alternative dispute resolution. In addition, the AA/OHA or a Judge may designate another Judge or attorney assigned to OHA to serve as a neutral in alternative dispute resolution procedures. If OHA provides the neutral and the mediation fails to resolve all issues in the case, the OHA-provided neutral will not be involved in the adjudication.
