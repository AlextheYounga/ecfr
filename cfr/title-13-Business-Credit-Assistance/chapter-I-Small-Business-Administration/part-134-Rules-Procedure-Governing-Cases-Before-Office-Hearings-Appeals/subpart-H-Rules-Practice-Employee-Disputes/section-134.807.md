##### ยง 134.807 SBA response. #####

(a) If the appeal goes to adjudication, SBA will file and serve the SBA's response to the appeal and a copy of the Dispute File.

(b) Unless the Judge orders a different date (either on his or her own initiative or on motion by a party), the SBA must file any response to the appeal petition no later than 15 days from the conclusion of mediation or 45 days from the filing of the appeal petition, whichever is later.

(c) The SBA's response and the Dispute File are normally the last submissions in an appeal, although the Judge may order or permit additional submissions. If a party wishes to file an additional submission, the party must file and serve a motion (see ยง 134.211) accompanied by the proposed submission.
