##### § 134.1001 Scope of rules. #####

(a) The rules of practice in this subpart apply to Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Center for Verification and Evaluation protests (CVE Protests).

(b) Except where inconsistent with this subpart, the provisions of subparts A and B of this part apply to protests listed in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The protest procedures described in this subpart are separate from those governing protests and appeals of a concern's size or status as a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Concern (SDVO SBC) for a non-Department of Veterans Affairs (non-VA) procurement. All protests relating to whether a veteran-owned concern is a “small” business for purposes of any Federal program are subject to part 121 of this chapter and must be filed in accordance with that part. If a protester protests both the size of the concern and the concern's eligibility for the CVE database, SBA will process each protest concurrently. SBA does not review issues concerning contract administration.

(d) Protests of a concern's eligibility for a non-VA procurement as a SDVO SBC are governed by 13 CFR part 125, subpart D.

(e) Appeals relating to determinations made by SBA's Director, Office of Government Contracting, regarding SDVO SBC status are governed by subpart E of this part.

(f) Appeals of denials and cancellations of verification for inclusion in the CVE database are governed by subpart K of this part.
