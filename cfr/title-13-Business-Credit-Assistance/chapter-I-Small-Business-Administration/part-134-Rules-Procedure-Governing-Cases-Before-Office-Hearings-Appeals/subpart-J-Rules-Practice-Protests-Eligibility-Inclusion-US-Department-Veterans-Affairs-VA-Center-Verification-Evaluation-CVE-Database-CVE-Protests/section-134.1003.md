Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 65666, Nov. 29, 2019.

(a) *Status.* In cases where the protest is based on service-connected disability, permanent and severe disability, or veteran status, the Judge will only consider a protest that presents specific allegations supporting the contention that the owner(s) cannot provide documentation from the VA, Department of Defense, or the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration to show that they meet the definition of veteran, service-disabled veteran, or service-disabled veteran with a permanent and severe disability.

(b) *Ownership and control.* In cases where the protest is based on ownership and control, the Judge will consider a protest only if the protester presents credible evidence that the concern is not 51% owned and controlled by one or more veterans or service-disabled veterans.

(c) *Date for determining eligibility.* (1) If the CVE Protest pertains to a procurement, the Judge will determine a protested concern's eligibility for inclusion in the CVE database as of the date of bid or initial offer, including price, and as of the date the CVE Protest was filed.

(2) If the CVE Protest does not pertain to a procurement, the Judge will determine a protested concern's eligibility for inclusion in the CVE database as of the date the CVE Protest was filed.
