##### ยง 123.407 When does your business apply for a pre-disaster mitigation loan and where does your business get an application? #####

SBA will publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the availability of pre-disaster mitigation loans. The notice will designate a 30-day application filing period with a specific opening date and filing deadline, as well as the locations for obtaining and filing loan applications. In addition to the Federal Register, SBA will coordinate with FEMA, and will issue press releases to the local media to inform potential loan applicants where to obtain loan applications. SBA will not accept any applications postmarked after the filing deadline; however, SBA may announce additional application periods each year depending on the availability of program funds.
