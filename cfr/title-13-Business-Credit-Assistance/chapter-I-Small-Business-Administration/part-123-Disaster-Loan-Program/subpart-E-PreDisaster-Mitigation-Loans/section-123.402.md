##### ยง 123.402 Can your business include its relocation as a mitigation measure in an application for a pre-disaster mitigation loan? #####

Yes, you may request a pre-disaster mitigation loan for the relocation of your business if:

(a) Your commercial real property (building) is located in a SFHA (Special Flood Hazard Area); and

(b) Your business relocates outside the SFHA but remains in the same participating pre-disaster mitigation community. Contact your regional FEMA office for a listing of communities participating in the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program and SFHAs or visit the FEMA Web site at *http://www.fema.gov.*
