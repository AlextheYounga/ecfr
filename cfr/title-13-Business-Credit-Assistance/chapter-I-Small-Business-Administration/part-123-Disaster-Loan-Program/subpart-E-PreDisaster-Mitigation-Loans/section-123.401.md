##### ยง 123.401 What types of mitigation measures can your business include in an application for a pre-disaster mitigation loan? #####

To be included in a pre-disaster mitigation loan application, each of your business' mitigation measures must satisfy the following criteria:

(a) The mitigation measure, as described in the application, must serve the purpose of protecting your commercial real property (building) or leasehold improvements or contents from damage that may be caused by future disasters; and

(b) The mitigation measure must conform to the priorities and goals of the State or local government's mitigation plan for the community in which the business subject to the measure is located. To show that this factor is satisfied your business must submit to SBA, as a part of your complete application, a written statement from a State or local emergency management coordinator confirming this fact (see ยง 123.408). Contact your regional FEMA office for a list of your State's emergency management coordinators or visit the FEMA Web site at *http://www.fema.gov.*
