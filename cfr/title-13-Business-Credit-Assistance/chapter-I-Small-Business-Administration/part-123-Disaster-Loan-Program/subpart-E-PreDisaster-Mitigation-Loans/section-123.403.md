##### ยง 123.403 When is your business eligible to apply for a pre-disaster mitigation loan? #####

To be eligible to apply for a pre-disaster mitigation loan your business must meet each of the following criteria:

(a) Your business, which is the subject of the pre-disaster mitigation measure, must be located in a participating pre-disaster mitigation community. Each State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands have at least one participating pre-disaster mitigation community. Contact your regional FEMA office to find out the locations of participating pre-disaster mitigation communities or visit the FEMA Web site at *http://www.fema.gov.*;

(b) If your business is proposing a mitigation measure that protects against a flood hazard, the location of your business which is the subject of the mitigation measure must be located in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). Contact your FEMA regional office to find out the locations of SFHAs or visit the FEMA Web site at *http://www.fema.gov.*;

(c) As of the date your business submits a complete Pre-Disaster Mitigation Small Business Loan Application to SBA (see ยง 123.408 for what SBA's considers to be a complete application), your business, along with its affiliates, must be a small business concern as defined in part 121 of this chapter. The definition of small business concern encompasses sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, limited liability entities, and other legal entities recognized under State law;

(d) Your business, which is the subject of the mitigation measure, must have operated as a business in its present location for at least one year before submitting its application;

(e) Your business, along with its affiliates and owners, must not have the financial resources to fund the proposed mitigation measures without undue hardship. SBA makes this determination based on the information your business submits as a part of its application; and

(f) If your business is owning and leasing out real property, the mitigation measures must be for protection of a building leased primarily for commercial rather than residential purposes (SBA will determine this based upon a comparative square footage basis).
