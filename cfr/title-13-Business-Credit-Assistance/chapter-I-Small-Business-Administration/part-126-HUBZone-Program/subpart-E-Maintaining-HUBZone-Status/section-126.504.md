##### § 126.504 When will SBA remove the designation of a concern in DSBS (or successor system) as a certified HUBZone small business concern? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 102502, Dec. 17, 2024.

(a) SBA will remove the designation of a concern in DSBS (or successor system) as a certified HUBZone small business concern if the concern has:

(1) Been decertified as a result of a HUBZone status protest pursuant to § 126.803;

(2) Been decertified as a result of the procedures set forth in § 126.503; or

(3) Voluntarily withdrawn from the HUBZone program pursuant to § 126.501(b).

(b) SBA will remove the designation of a concern in DSBS (or successor system) as a certified HUBZone small business concern as soon as the D/HUB issues a decision decertifying the concern from the program.

(c) After a concern has been removed as a certified HUBZone small business concern in DSBS (or successor system), it is ineligible for the HUBZone program and may not submit an offer for a HUBZone contract.

(1) As long as the concern was eligible at the time of its offer (and eligibility relates back to the date of its certification or recertification), it could be awarded a HUBZone contract even if it no longer appears as a certified HUBZone small business concern on DSBS on the date of award.

(2) If SBA determines that the concern's recertification was invalid (*i.e.,* based on a protest or program examination SBA determines that the concern did not qualify as a HUBZone small business concern on the date of its recertification), the concern will be ineligible for the award of any HUBZone contract for which it previously certified its HUBZone status.
