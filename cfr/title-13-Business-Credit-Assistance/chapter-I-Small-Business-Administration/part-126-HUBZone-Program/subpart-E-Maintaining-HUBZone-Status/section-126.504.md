Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 65247, Nov. 26, 2019.

If SBA determines at any time that a HUBZone SBC is not qualified, SBA may de-certify the HUBZone SBC, remove the concern from the List, and seek imposition of penalties pursuant to ยง 126.900. An adverse finding in the resolution of a protest also may result in de-certification and removal from the List, and the imposition of penalties pursuant to ยง 126.900. Failure to notify SBA of a material change which could affect a concern's eligibility will result in immediate de-certification, removal from the List, and SBA may seek the imposition of penalties under ยง 126.900.
