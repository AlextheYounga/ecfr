##### ยง 126.503 What happens if SBA is unable to verify a qualified HUBZone SBC's eligibility or determines that the concern is no longer eligible for the program? #####

If SBA is unable to verify a qualified HUBZone SBC's eligibility or determines it is not eligible for the program, SBA may propose decertification of the concern.

(a) *Proposing Decertification.* Except as set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, the Deputy D/HUB or designee will first notify the qualified HUBZone SBC in writing that SBA is proposing to decertify it, the reasons for the proposed de-certification, and that the SBC must rebut each of the reasons SBA sets forth. The qualified HUBZone SBC will have 30 calendar days from the date that it receives SBA's notification to respond, in writing, to the D/HUB or designee.

(b) *SBA's Decision.* The D/HUB or designee will consider the reasons for proposed decertification and the qualified HUBZone SBC's response before making a written decision whether to decertify. The D/HUB may draw an adverse inference where a qualified HUBZone SBC fails to cooperate with SBA or provide the information requested. The D/HUB's decision is the final agency decision.

(c) *Decertifying Pursuant to a Protest.* SBA will decertify a qualified HUBZone SBC and remove its name from the List without first proposing it for decertification if the D/HUB upholds a protest pursuant to ยง 126.803 and the D/HUB's decision is not overturned pursuant to ยง 126.805.
