##### ยง 126.201 Who does SBA consider to be an owner of a HUBZone small business concern? #####

For purposes of qualifying for HUBZone certification, SBA considers any person who owns any legal or equitable interest in a concern to be an owner of the concern. If an Employee Stock Ownership Plan owns all or part of the concern, SBA considers each stock trustee and plan member to be an owner. If a trust owns all or part of the concern, SBA considers each trustee and trust beneficiary to be an owner. In addition:

(a) *Corporations.* SBA considers any person who owns stock, whether voting or non-voting, to be an owner. SBA considers options to purchase stock and the right to convert debentures into voting stock to have been exercised.

Example:U.S. citizens own all of the stock of a corporation. A corporate officer, a non-U.S. citizen, owns no stock in the corporation but owns options to purchase stock in the corporation. SBA will consider the options exercised and the individual to be an owner. Therefore, if that corporate officer has options to purchase 50% or more of the corporate stock, pursuant to ยง 126.200, the corporation would not be eligible to be a qualified HUBZone SBC because it is not at least 51% owned and controlled by persons who are U.S. citizens.

(b) *Partnerships.* SBA considers all partners, whether general or limited, to be owners in a partnership.

(c) *Sole proprietorships.* The proprietor is the owner.

(d) *Limited liability companies.* SBA considers each member to be an owner of a limited liability company.
