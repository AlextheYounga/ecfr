##### ยง 126.202 Who does SBA consider to control a HUBZone SBC? #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 65243, Nov. 26, 2019.

Control means both the day-to-day management and long-term decision-making authority for the HUBZone SBC. Many persons share control of a concern, including each of those occupying the following positions: officer, director, general partner, managing partner, managing member and manager. In addition, key employees who possess expertise or responsibilities related to the concern's primary economic activity may share significant control of the concern. SBA will consider the control potential of such key employees on a case by case basis.
