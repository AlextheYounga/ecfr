##### ยง 126.606 May a CO request that SBA release a requirement from the 8(a)BD program for award as a HUBZone contract? #####

A CO may request that SBA release an 8(a) requirement for award as a HUBZone contract. However, SBA will grant its consent only where neither the incumbent nor any other 8(a) participant can perform the requirement. The request must be made to the AA/BD, who will make a determination after consulting with the D/HUB.
