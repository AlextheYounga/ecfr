##### § 126.309 May a declined or decertified concern seek certification at a later date? #####

A concern that SBA has declined or decertified may seek certification after ninety (90) calendar days from the date of decline or decertification if it believes that it has overcome all reasons for decline or decertification through changed circumstances and is currently eligible. A concern found to be ineligible during a HUBZone status protest is precluded from applying for HUBZone certification for ninety (90) calendar days from the date of the final agency decision (*i.e.,* the D/HUB's decision if the protest determination is not appealed, or OHA's decision if the protest determination is appealed) pursuant to 13 CFR 126.803(d)(5).
