##### ยง 126.304 What must a concern submit to SBA? #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 65244, Nov. 26, 2019.

(a) To be certified by SBA as a qualified HUBZone SBC, a concern must submit a completed application and represent to SBA that it meets the requirements set forth in ยง 126.200. After submitting the application, applicants must notify SBA of any material changes that could affect its eligibility. The concern must also submit any additional information required by SBA.

(b) Concerns applying for HUBZone status based on a location within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation must use SBA's maps (located at *https://eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/*) to verify that the location is within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation. If, however, SBA's maps indicate that the location is not within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation and the concern disagrees, then the concern must submit official documentation from the appropriate Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Land Titles and Records Office with jurisdiction over the concern's area, confirming that it is located within the external boundaries of an Indian reservation. BIA lists the Land Titles and Records Offices and their jurisdiction in 25 CFR 150.4 and 150.5.

(c) Concerns applying for HUBZone status based on a location within a qualified base closure area must use SBA's List of Qualified Base Closure Areas (located at *http://www.sba.gov/hubzone*) to verify that the location is within a qualified base closure area. If a concern disagrees with the failure of SBA's List of Qualified Base Closure Areas to include a particular area as a qualified base closure area, then the concern must submit relevant documentation from the Department of Defense, Office of Economic Adjustment, or the military department responsible for closing that installation.

(d) If the concern was decertified for failure to notify SBA of a material change affecting its eligibility pursuant to ยง 126.501, it must include with its application for certification a full explanation of why it failed to notify SBA of the material change. If SBA is not satisfied with the explanation provided, SBA may decline to certify the concern.
