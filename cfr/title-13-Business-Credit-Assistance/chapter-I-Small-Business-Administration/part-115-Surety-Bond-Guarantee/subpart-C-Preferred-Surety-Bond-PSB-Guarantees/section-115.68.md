##### ยง 115.68 Guarantee percentage. #####

SBA reimburses a PSB Surety in an amount not to exceed 70% of the Loss incurred and paid. Where the total Contract or Order amount increases beyond the Applicable Statutory Limit after Execution of the bond, SBA's share of the Loss is limited to that percentage of the increased Contract or Order amount which the statutory limit represents, multiplied by the guarantee percentage approved by SBA. For an example, see ยง 115.31(d).
