##### ยง 107.300 License application form and fee. #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 46007, July 18, 2023.

SBA evaluates license applicants in two review phases (initial review and final licensing), as follows:

(a) *Initial review.* Except as provided in this paragraph, SBIC applicants must submit a MAQ and the Initial Licensing Fee. MAQ means the Management Assessment Questionnaire in the form approved by SBA and available on SBA's Web site at *www.sba.gov/sbic.* Initial Licensing Fee means a non-refundable fee of $10,000. An applicant under Common Control with one or more Licensees must submit a written request to SBA, and the Initial Licensing Fee, to be considered for a license and is exempt from the requirement in this paragraph to submit a MAQ unless otherwise determined by SBA in SBA's discretion.

(b) *Final licensing.* (1) An applicant may proceed to the final licensing phase only if notified in writing by SBA that it may do so. Following receipt of such notice, in order to proceed to the final licensing phase, the applicant must submit a complete license application, in the form approved by SBA and available on SBA's Web site at *www.sba.gov/sbic,* within the timeframe identified by SBA; and the Final Licensing Fee. The Final Licensing Fee means a non-refundable fee (determined as of the date SBA accepts the application) adjusted annually as follows:

|              Time period              |Final licensing  <br/>fee|
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|
|December 13, 2017 to September 30, 2018|         $20,000         |
| October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019 |         25,000          |
| October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 |         30,000          |
| October 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021 |         35,000          |

(2) Beginning on October 1, 2021, SBA will annually adjust both the Initial Licensing Fee and Final Licensing Fee using the Inflation Adjustment and will publish a Notice prior to such adjustment in the Federal Register identifying the amount of the fee.
