##### § 107.1505 Liquidity requirements for Licensees issuing Participating Securities. #####

If you have outstanding Participating Securities, you must maintain sufficient liquidity to avoid a condition of Liquidity Impairment. Such a condition will constitute noncompliance with the terms of your Leverage under § 107.1820(e).

(a) *Definition of Liquidity Impairment.* A condition of Liquidity Impairment exists when your Liquidity Ratio, as determined in paragraph (b) of this section, is less than 1.20. You are responsible for calculating whether you have a condition of Liquidity Impairment:

(1) As of the close of your fiscal year;

(2) At the time you apply for Leverage, unless SBA permits otherwise; and

(3) At such time as you contemplate making any Distribution.

(b) *Computation of Liquidity Ratio.* Your Liquidity Ratio equals your Total Current Funds Available (A) divided by your Total Current Funds Required (B), as determined in the following table:
