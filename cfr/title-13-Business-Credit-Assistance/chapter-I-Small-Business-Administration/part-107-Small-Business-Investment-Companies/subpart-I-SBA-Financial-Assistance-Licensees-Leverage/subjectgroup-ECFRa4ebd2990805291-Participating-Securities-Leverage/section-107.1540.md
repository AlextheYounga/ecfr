##### § 107.1540 Distributions by Licensee—Prioritized Payments and Adjustments. #####

After you compute Prioritized Payments and Adjustments under § 107.1520, you must distribute them in accordance with this § 107.1540. You must notify SBA of any planned distribution under this section 10 business days before the distribution date, unless SBA permits otherwise.

(a) *Requirement to distribute Prioritized Payments and Adjustments.* This paragraph (a) applies only if you satisfy the liquidity requirement in § 107.1505. All Distributions under this paragraph (a) go to SBA or its designated agent or trustee.

(1) You must distribute the balance in your Distribution Account from § 107.1520 annually on the first or second Payment Date following your fiscal year end, and on any date when you are making any other Distribution.

(2) You may distribute all or part of the balance in your Distribution Account on any Payment Date regardless of whether you are making any other Distribution on that date.

(b) *Additional requirement for Licensees with undistributed Prioritized Payments.* This paragraph (b) applies if you do not distribute the full amount in your Distribution Account by the second Payment Date following the end of your fiscal year. At the end of each fiscal quarter, until you reduce the balance in your Distribution Account to zero, you must:

(1) Do all the steps in § 107.1520; and

(2) Distribute the balance in your Distribution Account on the next Payment Date following the end of your fiscal quarter, provided you satisfy the liquidity requirement in § 107.1505.
