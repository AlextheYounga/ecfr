(a) This subpart defines a Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB). It also establishes procedures by which SBA determines whether a particular concern qualifies as an SDB in response to a protest challenging the concern's status as disadvantaged. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the phrase “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals” in this subpart includes, Indian tribes, ANCs, CDCs, and NHOs.

(b) In order for a concern to represent that it is an SDB in order to receive a benefit as a prime contractor on a Federal Government procurement, it must:

(1) Be a current Participant, as defined in § 124.3 of this part, in SBA's 8(a) BD as described in § 124.1 of this part, program;

(2) Have been certified by SBA as an SDB within three years of the date it seeks to certify as an SDB;

(3) Have received certification from the procuring agency that it qualifies as an SDB; or

(4) Have submitted an application for SDB certification to the procuring agency and must not have received a negative determination regarding that application.

(c) A firm may represent that it qualifies as an SDB for any Federal subcontracting program if it believes in good faith that it is owned and controlled by one or more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
