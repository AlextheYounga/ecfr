##### § 124.1012 What will SBA do when it receives an SDB protest? #####

(a) Upon receipt of a protest challenging the disadvantaged status of a concern, the DC/SDBCE, or designee, will immediately notify the protestor and the contracting officer of the date the protest was received and whether it will be processed or dismissed for lack of timeliness or specificity.

(b) In cases where the protest is timely and sufficiently specific, the DC/SDBCE, or designee, will also immediately advise the protested concern of the protest and forward a copy of it to the protested concern.

(1) The DC/SDBCE, or designee, is authorized to ask the protested concern to provide any or all of the following information and documentation, completed so as to show the circumstances existing on the date of self-representation: SBA Form 1010A, “Statement of Personal Eligibility” for each individual claiming disadvantaged status; SBA Form 1010B, “Statement of Business Eligibility;” SBA Form 413, “Personal Financial Statement,” for each individual claiming disadvantaged status; information as to whether the protested concern, or any of its owners, officers or directors, have applied for admission to or participated in the SBA's 8(a) BD program and if so, the name of the company which applied or participated and the date of the application or entry into the program; business tax returns for the last two completed fiscal years prior to the date of self-representation; personal tax returns for the last two years prior to the date of self-representation for all individuals claiming disadvantaged status, all officers, all directors and for any individual owning at least 10% of the business entity; annual business financial statements for the last two completed fiscal years prior to the date of self-representation; a current monthly or quarterly business financial statement no older than 90 days; articles of incorporation; corporate by-laws; partnership agreements; limited liability company articles of organization; and any other relevant information as to whether the protested concern is disadvantaged.

(2) SBA's disadvantaged status determination need not be limited to consideration only of the issues raised in the protest. SBA may consider other applicable criteria.

(3) Unless the protest presents specific credible information which calls into question the veracity of application or other documents previously submitted to SBA by a current Participant in SBA's 8(a) BD program, SBA will allow the Participant to submit, in lieu of the information specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a sworn affidavit or declaration that circumstances concerning the ownership and control of the business and the disadvantaged status of its principals have not changed since its application or entry into the program or its most recent annual review, and a copy of its most recently completed annual review.

(i) If the ownership or control of the business or the disadvantaged status of any principals have changed, the protested concern must comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(ii) An affidavit or declaration may be allowed only if SBA admitted the protested concern to the 8(a) BD program, or conducted an annual review of the protested concern, during the 12month period preceding the date on which SBA receives the protest, and if proceedings to suspend, terminate or early graduate the concern from the 8(a) BD program are not pending.

(c) Within 10 working days of the date that notification of the protest was received from the DC/SDBCE or designee, the protested concern must submit to the DC/SDBCE or designee, by personal delivery, FAX, or mail, the information and documentation requested pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section or the affidavit permitted by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Materials submitted must be received by the close of business on the 10th working day.

(1) SBA will consider only materials submitted timely, and the late or non-submission of materials needed to make a disadvantaged status determination may result in sustaining the protest.

(2) The burden is on the protested concern to demonstrate its disadvantaged status, whether or not it is currently shown on the list of qualified SDBs.

(3) The protested concern must timely submit to SBA any information it deems relevant to a determination of its disadvantaged status.
