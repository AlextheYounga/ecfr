##### ยง 124.1007 Who may protest the disadvantaged status of a concern? #####

(a) In connection with a requirement for which the apparent successful offeror has invoked an SDB evaluation adjustment or an SDB set-aside, the following entities may protest the disadvantaged status of the apparent successful offeror:

(1) Any other concern which submitted an offer for that requirement, unless the contracting officer has found the concern to be non-responsive or outside the competitive range, or SBA has previously found the protesting concern to be ineligible for the requirement at issue;

(2) The procuring activity contracting officer; or

(3) SBA.

(b) In connection with an 8(d) subcontract, or a requirement for which the apparent successful offeror received an evaluation adjustment for proposing one or more SDB subcontractors, the procuring activity contracting officer or SBA may protest the disadvantaged status of a proposed subcontractor. Other interested parties may submit information to the contracting officer or SBA in an effort to persuade the contracting officer or SBA to initiate a protest.

(c) An interested party seeking to protest both the disadvantaged status and size of an apparent successful SDB offeror must submit two separate protests, one as to disadvantaged status pursuant to this subpart, and one as to size pursuant to part 121 of this title. An interested party seeking to protest only size of an apparent successful SDB offeror must submit a size protest to the contracting officer pursuant to part 121.
