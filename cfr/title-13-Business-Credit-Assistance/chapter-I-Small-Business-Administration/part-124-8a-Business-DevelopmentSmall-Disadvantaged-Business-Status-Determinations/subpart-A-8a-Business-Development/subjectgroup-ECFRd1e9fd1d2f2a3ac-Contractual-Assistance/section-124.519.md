##### ยง 124.519 Are there any dollar limits on the amount of 8(a) contracts that a Participant may receive? #####

(a) A Participant (other than one owned by an Indian Tribe, ANC or NHO) may not receive sole source 8(a) contract awards where it has received a combined total of competitive and sole source 8(a) contracts in excess of the dollar amount set forth in this section during its participation in the 8(a) BD program.

(1) For a firm having a receipts-based primary NAICS code at time of program entry, the limit above which it can no longer receive sole source 8(a) contracts is five times the size standard corresponding to its primary NAICS code which is determined as of the date of SBA's acceptance of the requirement for the 8(a) BD program or $100,000,000, whichever is less.

(2) For a firm having an employee-based primary NAICS code at time of program entry, the limit above which it can no longer receive sole source 8(a) contracts is $100,000,000.

(3) SBA will not consider 8(a) contracts awarded under $100,000 in determining whether a Participant has reached the limit identified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section.

(b) Once the limit is reached, a firm may not receive any more 8(a) sole source contracts, but may remain eligible for competitive 8(a) awards.

(c) SBA includes the dollar value of 8(a) options and modifications in determining whether a Participant has reached the limit identified in paragraph (a) of this section. If an option is not exercised or the contract value is reduced by modification, SBA will deduct those values.

(d) A Participant's eligibility for a sole source award in terms of whether it has exceeded the dollar limit for 8(a) contracts is measured as of the date that the requirement is accepted for the 8(a) program without taking into account whether the value of that award will cause the limit to be exceeded.

(e) The AA/BD may waive the requirement prohibiting a Participant from receiving sole source 8(a) contracts in excess of the dollar amount set forth in this section where the head of a procuring activity represents that award of a sole source 8(a) contract to the Participant is needed to achieve significant interests of the Government.
