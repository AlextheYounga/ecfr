##### § 127.400 How does a concern maintain its WOSB or EDWOSB certification? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 102507, Dec. 17, 2024.

Any concern seeking to remain a certified WOSB or EDWOSB must undergo a program examination every three years.

(a) SBA or a third-party certifier will conduct a program examination three years after the concern's initial WOSB or EDWOSB certification (whether by SBA or a third-party certifier) or three years after the date of the concern's last program examination, whichever date is later.

*Example to paragraph (a).* Concern A is certified by SBA to be eligible for the WOSB Program on March 31, 2023. Concern A is considered a certified WOSB that is eligible to receive WOSB contracts (as long as it is small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract) through March 30, 2026. On April 22, 2025, after Concern A is identified as the apparent successful offeror on a WOSB set-aside contract, its status as an eligible WOSB is protested. On May 15, 2025, Concern A receives a positive determination from SBA confirming that it is an eligible WOSB. Concern A's new certification date is May 15, 2025. Concern A is now considered a certified WOSB that is eligible to receive WOSB contracts (as long as it is small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract) through May 14, 2028.

(b) The concern must either request a program examination from SBA or notify SBA that it has requested a program examination from a third-party certifier no later than 30 days prior to its certification anniversary. Failure to do so will result in the concern being decertified.

*Example to paragraph (b).* Concern B is certified by a third-party certifier to be eligible for the WOSB Program on July 20, 2023. Concern B is considered a certified WOSB that is eligible to receive WOSB contracts (as long as it is small for the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract) through July 19, 2026. Concern B must request a program examination from SBA or notify SBA that it has requested a program examination from a third-party certifier, by June 20, 2026, to continue participating in the WOSB Program after July 19, 2026.

(c) The SBA Administrator or designee may postpone the program examination and recertification process in appropriate, extraordinary circumstances.
