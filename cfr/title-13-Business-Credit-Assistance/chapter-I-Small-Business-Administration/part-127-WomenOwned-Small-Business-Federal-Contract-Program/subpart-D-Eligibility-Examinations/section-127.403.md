##### ยง 127.403 What happens if SBA verifies the concern's eligibility? #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 27664, May 11, 2020.

If SBA verifies that the concern satisfies the applicable EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility requirements, then the D/GC will send the concern a written decision to that effect and will allow the concern's EDWOSB or WOSB designation in SAM (or any successor system) to stand and the concern may continue to self-certify its EDWOSB or WOSB status.
