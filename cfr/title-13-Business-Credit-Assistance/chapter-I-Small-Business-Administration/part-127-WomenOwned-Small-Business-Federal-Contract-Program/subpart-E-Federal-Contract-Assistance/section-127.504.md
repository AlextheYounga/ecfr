##### ยง 127.504 What additional requirements must a concern satisfy to submit an offer on an EDWOSB or WOSB requirement? #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 27664, May 11, 2020.

(a) In order for a concern to submit an offer on a specific EDWOSB or WOSB requirement, the concern must ensure that the appropriate representations and certifications in SAM (or any successor system) are accurate and complete at the time it submits its offer to the contracting officer, including, but not limited to, the fact that:

(1) It is small under the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code assigned to the contract;

(2) It is listed in SAM (or any successor system) as an EDWOSB or WOSB; and

(3) There has been no material change in any of its circumstances affecting its EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility.

(b) The concern must also meet the applicable limitations on subcontracting requirements as set forth in ยง 125.6 of this chapter.

(c) *Ostensible subcontractor.* Where a subcontractor that is not similarly situated performs primary and vital requirements of a set-aside service contract, or where a prime contractor is unduly reliant on a small business that is not similarly situated to perform the set-aside service contract, the prime contractor is not eligible for award of a WOSB or EDWOSB contract.

(1) When the subcontractor is small for the size standard assigned to the procurement, this issue may be grounds for a WOSB or EDWOSB status protest, as described in subpart F of this part. When the subcontractor is other than small or alleged to be other than small for the size standard assigned to the procurement, this issue may be a ground for a size protest, as described at ยง 121.103(h)(4) of this chapter.

(2) SBA will find that a prime WOSB or EDWOSB contractor is performing the primary and vital requirements of a contract or order and is not unduly reliant on one or more non-similarly situated subcontracts where the prime contractor can demonstrate that it, together with any similarly situated entity, will meet the limitations on subcontracting provisions set forth in ยง 125.6.
