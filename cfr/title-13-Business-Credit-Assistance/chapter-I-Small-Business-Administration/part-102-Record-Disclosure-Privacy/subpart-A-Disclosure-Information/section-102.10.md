##### ยง 102.10 What happens if I subpoena records or testimony of employees in connection with a civil lawsuit, criminal proceeding or administrative proceeding to which SBA is not a party? #####

(a) The person to whom the subpoena is directed must consult with SBA counsel in the relevant SBA office, who will seek approval for compliance from the Associate General Counsel for Litigation. Except where the subpoena requires the testimony of an employee of the Inspector General's office, or records within the possession of the Inspector General, the Associate General Counsel may delegate the authorization for appropriate production of documents or testimony to local SBA counsel.

(b) If SBA counsel approves compliance with the subpoena, SBA will comply.

(c) If SBA counsel disapproves compliance with the subpoena, SBA will not comply, and will base such noncompliance on an appropriate legal basis such as privilege or a statute.

(d) SBA counsel must provide a copy of any subpoena relating to a criminal matter to SBA's Inspector General prior to its return date.
