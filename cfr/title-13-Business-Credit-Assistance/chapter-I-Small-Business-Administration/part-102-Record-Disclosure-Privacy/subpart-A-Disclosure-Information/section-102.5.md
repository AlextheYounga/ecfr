##### ยง 102.5 Responses to requests. #####

Within the time limits described in ยง 102.4, SBA will respond to your request in writing. SBA's response will do one or more of the following:

(a) Advise you that SBA is releasing the requested documents;

(b) Explain why SBA has decided not to give you all or some of the records requested, citing specific FOIA exemptions where applicable and noting the number of pages withheld (except where noting the number of pages withheld would harm an interest protected by an exemption), and explain how to appeal that decision;

(c) Provide a cost estimate or bill you for the actual fee, less any advance payment you have made. SBA will not provide any records until payment in full is received; and/or

(d) Advise you that SBA will refer your request for records generated by another Federal agency to that agency for proper processing.
