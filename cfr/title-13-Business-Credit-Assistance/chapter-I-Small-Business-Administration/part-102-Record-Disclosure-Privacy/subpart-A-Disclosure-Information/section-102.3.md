##### ยง 102.3 Requirements pertaining to the submission of requests. #####

(a) You may make a request for SBA records by writing directly to the program or field office that maintains the records, or to the Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts (FOI/PA) Office by mail to 409 3rd St., SW., Washington, DC 20416 or fax to 202-205-7059 or e-mail to *foia@sba.gov.* The office receiving your request will forward it to the correct office. The correct office will consider your request to be complete only when you:

(1) Describe the records sought in enough detail for an Agency employee to locate the records with a reasonable amount of effort;

(2) Agree to pay applicable fees pursuant to ยง 102.6, unless you seek a waiver of fees; and

(3) Make an advance payment if either the correct office estimates the fees will exceed $250 or you owe for past FOIA fees. If you owe past due FOIA fees, you must pay the estimated amount, plus any past due charges and interest.

(b) If you make a request on behalf of another person for information pertaining to that person, your request must include an authorization signed by the latter, allowing SBA to release such information to you.

(c) To make a Privacy Act request for records about yourself, you must follow the procedures detailed in ยง 102.34(b) of subpart B.
