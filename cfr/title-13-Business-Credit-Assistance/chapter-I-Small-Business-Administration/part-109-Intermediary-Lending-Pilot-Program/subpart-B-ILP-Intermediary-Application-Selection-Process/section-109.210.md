(a) *General.* SBA will evaluate and select applicants to participate in the ILP program in accordance with this section and the NOFA. SBA reserves the right, in its discretion, to loan less than all available funds.

(b) *Number of ILP Intermediaries.* SBA will make loans to not more than 20 of the selected ILP Intermediaries in each of the fiscal years for which funding is available.

(c) *Eligibility and completeness.* SBA will not consider any application that is not complete or that is submitted by an applicant that does not meet the eligibility and participation criteria established by SBA. SBA, at its sole discretion, may request from an applicant additional information, including information concerning participation criteria or the application, in order to allow SBA to consider that applicant's application. Failure to provide such additional information may be considered grounds to reject the application.

(d) *Evaluation criteria.* Eligible and complete applications will be evaluated and scored based on the criteria established by SBA, as set forth in the NOFA. In general, eligible applications with the highest scores will be granted ILP Intermediary status, up to the maximum number allowed by statute. SBA reserves the right to select ILP Intermediaries in such a way as to ensure geographic diversity of areas served by ILP Intermediaries.
