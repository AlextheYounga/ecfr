##### ยง 29.933 What is the effect of an appeal on negotiations? #####

A pending appeal of a termination decision will not affect or prevent the award of another funding agreement or TTP Agreement.

However, if the Department terminates all or a portion of a compact or funding agreement due to a finding of gross mismanagement or imminent jeopardy that is sustained on appeal, and the Tribe has not corrected the adverse findings, the Department has discretion to reject a proposal to award the Tribe a new funding agreement or provide new funds in an existing funding agreement.
