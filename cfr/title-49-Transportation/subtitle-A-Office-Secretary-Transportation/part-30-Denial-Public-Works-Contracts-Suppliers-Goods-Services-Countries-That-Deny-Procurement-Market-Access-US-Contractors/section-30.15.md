(b) *General.* This clause implements the procurement provisions contained in the Continuing Resolution on the Fiscal Year 1988 Budget, Public Law No. 100-202, and the Airport and Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987, Public Law No. 100-223.

(c) *Restrictions.* The Contractor shall not knowingly enter into any subcontract under this contract: (1) With a subcontractor of a foreign country included on the list of countries that discriminate against U.S. firms published by the United States Trade Representative (U.S.T.R.); or (2) for the supply of any product for use on the Federal Public works project under this contract that is produced or manufactured in a foreign country included on the list of countries that discriminate against U.S. firms published by the U.S.T.R.

(d) *Certification.* The Contractor may rely upon the certification of a prospective subcontractor that it is not a subcontractor of a foreign country included on the list of countries that discriminates against U.S. firms published by the U.S.T.R. and that products supplied by such subcontractor for use on the Federal public works project under this contract are not products of a foreign country included on the list of countries that discriminate against U.S. firms published by the U.S.T.R., unless the contractor has knowledge that the certification is erroneous.
