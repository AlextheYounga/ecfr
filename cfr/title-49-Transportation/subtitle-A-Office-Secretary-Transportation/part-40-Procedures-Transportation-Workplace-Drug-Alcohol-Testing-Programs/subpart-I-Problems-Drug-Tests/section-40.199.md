##### § 40.199 What problems always cause a drug test to be cancelled? #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 52246, Nov. 13, 2017.

(a) As the MRO, when the laboratory discovers a “fatal flaw” during its processing of incoming specimens (see § 40.83), the laboratory will report to you that the specimen has been “Rejected for Testing” (with the reason stated). You must always cancel such a test.

(b) The following are “fatal flaws”:

(1) There is no printed collector's name *and* no collector's signature;

(2) The specimen ID numbers on the specimen bottle and the CCF do not match;

(3) The specimen bottle seal is broken or shows evidence of tampering (and a split specimen cannot be redesignated, see § 40.83(g)); and

(4) Because of leakage or other causes, there is an insufficient amount of urine in the primary specimen bottle for analysis and the specimens cannot be redesignated (see § 40.83(g)).

(c) You must report the result as provided in § 40.161 .
