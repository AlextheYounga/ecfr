##### § 40.87 What are the cutoff concentrations for drug tests? #####

(a) As a laboratory, you must use the cutoff concentrations displayed in the following table for initial and confirmatory drug tests. All cutoff concentrations are expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). The table follows:

|      6-Acetylmorphine      |            10 ng/mL             |     6-Acetylmorphine      |              10 ng/mL.               |
|       Phencyclidine        |            25 ng/mL             |       Phencyclidine       |              25 ng/mL.               |
|  Amphetamines<sup>3</sup>  |                                 |                           |                                      |
|    AMP/MAMP<sup>4</sup>    |            500 ng/mL            |        Amphetamine        |              250 ng/mL.              |
|                            |                                 |Methamphetamine<sup>5</sup>|              250 ng/mL.              |
|      MDMA<sup>6</sup>      |            500 ng/mL            |           MDMA            |              250 ng/mL.              |
|                            |                                 |      MDA<sup>7</sup>      |              250 ng/mL.              |
|                            |                                 |     MDEA<sup>8</sup>      |              250 ng/mL               |

<sup>1</sup> Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA).

<sup>2</sup> Morphine is the target analyte for codeine/morphine testing.

<sup>3</sup> Either a single initial test kit or multiple initial test kits may be used provided the single test kit detects each target analyte independently at the specified cutoff.

<sup>4</sup> Methamphetamine is the target analyte for amphetamine/methamphetamine testing.

<sup>5</sup> To be reported positive for methamphetamine, a specimen must also contain amphetamine at a concentration equal to or greater than 100 ng/mL.

<sup>6</sup> Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).

<sup>7</sup> Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA).

<sup>8</sup> Methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA).

(b) On an initial drug test, you must report a result below the cutoff concentration as negative. If the result is at or above the cutoff concentration, you must conduct a confirmation test.

(c) On a confirmation drug test, you must report a result below the cutoff concentration as negative and a result at or above the cutoff concentration as confirmed positive.

(d) You must report quantitative values for morphine or codeine at 15,000 ng/mL or above.
