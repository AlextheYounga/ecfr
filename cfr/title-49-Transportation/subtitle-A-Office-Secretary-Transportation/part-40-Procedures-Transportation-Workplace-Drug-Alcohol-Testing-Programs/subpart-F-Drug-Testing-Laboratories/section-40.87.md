Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 27643, May 2, 2023.

(a) As a laboratory, you must use the cutoff concentrations displayed in the following table for initial and confirmatory drug tests. All cutoff concentrations are expressed in nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). The table follows:

|          Initial test analyte          |Initial test cutoff<sup>1</sup>|    Confirmatory test analyte    |Confirmatory test cutoff concentration|
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|Marijuana metabolites (THCA)<sup>2</sup>|     50 ng/mL<sup>3</sup>      |              THCA               |              15 ng/mL.               |
|  Cocaine metabolite (Benzoylecgonine)  |     150 ng/mL<sup>3</sup>     |         Benzoylecgonine         |              100 ng/mL.              |
|        Codeine/  <br/>Morphine         |          2000 ng/mL           |     Codeine  <br/>Morphine      |    2000 ng/mL.  <br/>2000 ng/mL.     |
|    Hydrocodone/  <br/>Hydromorphone    |           300 ng/mL           | Hydrocodone  <br/>Hydromorphone |     100 ng/mL.  <br/>100 ng/mL.      |
|      Oxycodone/  <br/>Oxymorphone      |           100 ng/mL           |   Oxycodone  <br/>Oxymorphone   |     100 ng/mL.  <br/>100 ng/mL.      |
|            6-Acetylmorphine            |           10 ng/mL            |        6-Acetylmorphine         |              10 ng/mL.               |
|             Phencyclidine              |           25 ng/mL            |          Phencyclidine          |              25 ng/mL.               |
|   Amphetamine/  <br/>Methamphetamine   |           500 ng/mL           |Amphetamine  <br/>Methamphetamine|     250 ng/mL.  <br/>250 ng/mL.      |
|    MDMA<sup>4</sup>/MDA<sup>5</sup>    |           500 ng/mL           |         MDMA  <br/>MDA          |     250 ng/mL.  <br/>250 ng/mL.      |

<sup>1</sup> For grouped analytes (i.e., two or more analytes that are in the same drug class and have the same initial test cutoff):

Immunoassay: The test must be calibrated with one analyte from the group identified as the target analyte. The cross-reactivity of the immunoassay to the other analyte(s) within the group must be 80 percent or greater; if not, separate immunoassays must be used for the analytes within the group.

Alternate technology: Either one analyte or all analytes from the group must be used for calibration, depending on the technology. At least one analyte within the group must have a concentration equal to or greater than the initial test cutoff or, alternatively, the sum of the analytes present (i.e., equal to or greater than the laboratory's validated limit of quantification) must be equal to or greater than the initial test cutoff.

<sup>2</sup> An immunoassay must be calibrated with the target analyte, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA).

<sup>3</sup>Alternate technology (THCA and Benzoylecgonine): When using an alternate technology initial test for the specific target analytes of THCA and Benzoylecgonine, the laboratory must use the same cutoff for the initial and confirmatory tests (i.e., 15 ng/mL for THCA and 100ng/mL for Benzoylecgonine).

<sup>4</sup> Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).

<sup>5</sup> Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA).

(b) On an initial drug test, you must report a result below the cutoff concentration as negative. If the result is at or above the cutoff concentration, you must conduct a confirmation test.

(c) On a confirmation drug test, you must report a result below the cutoff concentration as negative and a result at or above the cutoff concentration as confirmed positive.

(d) You must report quantitative values for morphine or codeine at 15,000 ng/mL or above.
