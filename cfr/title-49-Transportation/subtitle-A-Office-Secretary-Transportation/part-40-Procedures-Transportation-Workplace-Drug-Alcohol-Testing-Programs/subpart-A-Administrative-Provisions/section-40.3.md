##### § 40.3 What do the terms used in this part mean? #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 27636, May 2, 2023.

In this part, the terms listed in this section have the following meanings:

*Adulterated specimen.* A specimen that has been altered, as evidenced by test results showing either a substance that is not a normal constituent for that type of specimen or showing an abnormal concentration of an endogenous substance.

*Affiliate.* Persons are affiliates of one another if, directly or indirectly, one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party controls or has the power to control both. Indicators of control include, but are not limited to: interlocking management or ownership; shared interest among family members; shared facilities or equipment; or common use of employees. Following the issuance of a public interest exclusion, an organization having the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees as the service agent concerning whom a public interest exclusion is in effect is regarded as an affiliate. This definition is used in connection with the public interest exclusion procedures of Subpart R of this part.

*Air blank.* In evidential breath testing devices (EBTs) using gas chromatography technology, a reading of the device's internal standard. In all other EBTs, a reading of ambient air containing no alcohol.

*Alcohol.* The intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol or other low molecular weight alcohols, including methyl or isopropyl alcohol.

*Alcohol concentration.* The alcohol in a volume of breath expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as indicated by a breath test under this part.

*Alcohol confirmation test.* A subsequent test using an EBT, following a screening test with a result of 0.02 or greater, that provides quantitative data about the alcohol concentration.

*Alcohol screening device (ASD).* A breath or saliva device, other than an EBT, that is approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and appears on ODAPC's Web page for “Approved Screening Devices to Measure Alcohol in Bodily Fluids” because it conforms to the model specifications from NHTSA.

*Alcohol screening test.* An analytic procedure to determine whether an employee may have a prohibited concentration of alcohol in a breath or saliva specimen.

*Alcohol testing site.* A place selected by the employer where employees present themselves for the purpose of providing breath or saliva for an alcohol test.

*Alcohol use.* The drinking or swallowing of any beverage, liquid mixture or preparation (including any medication), containing alcohol.

*Aliquot.* A fractional part of a specimen used for testing. It is taken as a sample representing the whole specimen.

*Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT).* A person who instructs and assists employees in the alcohol testing process and operates an evidential breath testing device.

*Cancelled test.* A drug or alcohol test that has a problem identified that cannot be or has not been corrected, or which this part otherwise requires to be cancelled. A cancelled test is neither a positive nor a negative test.

*Chain of custody.* The procedure used to document the handling of the urine specimen from the time the employee gives the specimen to the collector until the specimen is destroyed. This procedure uses the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF) as approved by the Office of Management and Budget.

*Collection container.* A container into which the employee urinates to provide the specimen for a drug test.

*Collection site.* A place selected by the employer where employees present themselves for the purpose of providing a urine specimen for a drug test.

*Collector.* A person who instructs and assists employees at a collection site, who receives and makes an initial inspection of the specimen provided by those employees, and who initiates and completes the CCF.

*Confirmatory drug test.* A second analytical procedure performed on a different aliquot of the original specimen to identify and quantify the presence of a specific drug or drug metabolite.

*Confirmatory validity test.* A second test performed on a different aliquot of the original urine specimen to further support a validity test result.

*Confirmed drug test.* A confirmation test result received by an MRO from a laboratory.

*Consortium/Third-party administrator (C/TPA).* A service agent that provides or coordinates the provision of a variety of drug and alcohol testing services to employers. C/TPAs typically perform administrative tasks concerning the operation of the employers' drug and alcohol testing programs. This term includes, but is not limited to, groups of employers who join together to administer, as a single entity, the DOT drug and alcohol testing programs of its members. C/TPAs are not “employers” for purposes of this part.

*Continuing education.* Training for substance abuse professionals (SAPs) who have completed qualification training and are performing SAP functions, designed to keep SAPs current on changes and developments in the DOT drug and alcohol testing program.

*Designated employer representative (DER).* An employee authorized by the employer to take immediate action(s) to remove employees from safety-sensitive duties, or cause employees to be removed from these covered duties, and to make required decisions in the testing and evaluation processes. The DER also receives test results and other communications for the employer, consistent with the requirements of this part. Service agents cannot act as DERs.

*Dilute specimen.* A urine specimen with creatinine and specific gravity values that are lower than expected for human urine.

*DOT, The Department, DOT Agency.* These terms encompass all DOT agencies, including, but not limited to, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and the Office of the Secretary (OST).

*Drugs.* The drugs for which tests are required under this part and DOT agency regulations are marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine (PCP), and opioids.

*Employee.* Any person who is designated in a DOT agency regulation as subject to drug testing and/or alcohol testing. The term includes individuals currently performing safety-sensitive functions designated in DOT agency regulations and applicants for employment subject to pre-employment testing. For purposes of drug testing under this part, the term employee has the same meaning as the term “donor” as found on CCF and related guidance materials produced by the Department of Health and Human Services.

*Employer.* A person or entity employing one or more employees (including an individual who is self-employed) subject to DOT agency regulations requiring compliance with this part. The term includes an employer's officers, representatives, and management personnel. Service agents are not employers for the purposes of this part.

*Error Correction Training.* Training provided to BATs, collectors, and screening test technicians (STTs) following an error that resulted in the cancellation of a drug or alcohol test. Error correction training must be provided in person or by a means that provides real-time observation and interaction between the instructor and trainee.

*Evidential Breath Testing Device (EBT).* A device that is approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for the evidential testing of breath at the .02 and .04 alcohol concentrations, and appears on ODAPC's Web page for “Approved Evidential Breath Measurement Devices” because it conforms with the model specifications available from NHTSA.

*HHS.* The Department of Health and Human Services or any designee of the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services.
