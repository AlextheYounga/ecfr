##### § 40.3 What do the terms used in this part mean? #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 52243, Nov. 13, 2017.

In this part, the terms listed in this section have the following meanings:

*Adulterated specimen.* A specimen that has been altered, as evidenced by test results showing either a substance that is not a normal constituent for that type of specimen or showing an abnormal concentration of an endogenous substance.

*Affiliate.* Persons are affiliates of one another if, directly or indirectly, one controls or has the power to control the other, or a third party controls or has the power to control both. Indicators of control include, but are not limited to: interlocking management or ownership; shared interest among family members; shared facilities or equipment; or common use of employees. Following the issuance of a public interest exclusion, an organization having the same or similar management, ownership, or principal employees as the service agent concerning whom a public interest exclusion is in effect is regarded as an affiliate. This definition is used in connection with the public interest exclusion procedures of Subpart R of this part.

*Air blank.* In evidential breath testing devices (EBTs) using gas chromatography technology, a reading of the device's internal standard. In all other EBTs, a reading of ambient air containing no alcohol.

*Alcohol.* The intoxicating agent in beverage alcohol, ethyl alcohol or other low molecular weight alcohols, including methyl or isopropyl alcohol.

*Alcohol concentration.* The alcohol in a volume of breath expressed in terms of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath as indicated by a breath test under this part.

*Alcohol confirmation test.* A subsequent test using an EBT, following a screening test with a result of 0.02 or greater, that provides quantitative data about the alcohol concentration.

*Alcohol screening device (ASD).* A breath or saliva device, other than an EBT, that is approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and placed on a conforming products list (CPL) for such devices.

*Alcohol screening test.* An analytic procedure to determine whether an employee may have a prohibited concentration of alcohol in a breath or saliva specimen.

*Alcohol testing site.* A place selected by the employer where employees present themselves for the purpose of providing breath or saliva for an alcohol test.

*Alcohol use.* The drinking or swallowing of any beverage, liquid mixture or preparation (including any medication), containing alcohol.

*Aliquot.* A fractional part of a specimen used for testing. It is taken as a sample representing the whole specimen.

*Blind specimen or blind performance test specimen.* A specimen submitted to a laboratory for quality control testing purposes, with a fictitious identifier, so that the laboratory cannot distinguish it from an employee specimen.

*Breath Alcohol Technician (BAT).* A person who instructs and assists employees in the alcohol testing process and operates an evidential breath testing device.

*Cancelled test.* A drug or alcohol test that has a problem identified that cannot be or has not been corrected, or which this part otherwise requires to be cancelled. A cancelled test is neither a positive nor a negative test.

*Chain of custody.* The procedure used to document the handling of the urine specimen from the time the employee gives the specimen to the collector until the specimen is destroyed. This procedure uses the Federal Drug Testing Custody and Control Form (CCF) as approved by the Office of Management and Budget.
