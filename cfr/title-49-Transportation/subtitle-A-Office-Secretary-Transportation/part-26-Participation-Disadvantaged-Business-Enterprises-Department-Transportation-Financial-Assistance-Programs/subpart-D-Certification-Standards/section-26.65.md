##### § 26.65 Business Size Determinations. #####

(a) *By NAICS Code.* A firm (including its affiliates) must be a small business, as defined by the Small Business Administration (SBA). The certifier must apply the SBA business size limit in 13 CFR part 121 which corresponds to the applicable primary industry classifications (NAICS codes). The firm is ineligible when its affiliated “receipts” (computed on a cash basis), as defined in 13 CFR 121.104(a) and averaged over the firm's preceding five fiscal years, exceed the applicable SBA size cap(s).

(b) *Statutory Cap.* Even if a firm is a small business under paragraph (a) of this section, it is ineligible to perform DBE work on FHWA or FTA assisted contracts if its affiliated annual gross receipts, as defined in 13 CFR 121.104, over the firm's previous three fiscal years exceed $30.40 million (as of March 1, 2023). The Department will adjust this amount annually and post the adjusted amount on its website available at *https://www.transportation.gov/DBEsizestandards.*
