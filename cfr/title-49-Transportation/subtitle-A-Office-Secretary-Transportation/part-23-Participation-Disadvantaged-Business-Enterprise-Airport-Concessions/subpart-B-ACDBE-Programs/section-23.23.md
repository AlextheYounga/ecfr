##### § 23.23 What administrative provisions must be in a recipient's ACDBE program? #####

(a) If, as a recipient that must have an ACDBE program, the program must include provisions for a policy statement, liaison officer, and directory, as provided in part 26, §§ 26.23, 26.25, and 26.31, as well as certification of ACDBEs as provided by Subpart C of this part. You must include a statement in your program committing you to operating your ACDBE program in a nondiscriminatory manner.

(b) You may combine your provisions for implementing these requirements under this part and part 26 (*e.g.*, a single policy statement can cover both Federally-assisted airport contracts and concessions; the same individual can act as the liaison officer for both part 23 and part 26 matters).
