##### ยง 633.21 Basic requirement. #####

(a) If a project meets the definition of major capital project, the recipient shall submit a project management plan prepared in accordance with ยง 633.25 of this part, as a condition of Federal financial assistance. As a general rule, the PMP must be submitted during the grant review process and is part of FTA's grant application review. This section applies if:

(1) The project fails under one of the automatic major capital investment project categories (ยง 633.5(1) or (2) of this part); or

(2) FTA makes a determination that a project is a major capital project, consistent with the definition of major capital project in ยง 633.5. This determination normally will be made during the grant review process. However, FTA may make such determination after grant approval.

(b)(1) FTA will notify the recipient when it must submit the PMP. Normally, FTA will notify the recipient sometime during the grant review process. If FTA determines the project is major under its discretionary authority after the grant has been approved, FTA will inform the recipient of its determination as soon as possible.

(2) Once FTA has notified the recipient that it must submit a plan, the recipient will have a minimum of 90 days to submit the plan.
