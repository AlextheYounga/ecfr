A small public transportation provider only must include in its safety assurance process the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) *Safety performance monitoring and measurement.* A transit agency must establish activities to:

(1) Monitor its system for compliance with, and sufficiency of, the agency's procedures for operations and maintenance;

(2) Monitor its operations to identify any safety risk mitigations that may be ineffective, inappropriate, or were not implemented as intended;

(3) Conduct investigations of safety events to identify causal factors; and

(4) Monitor information reported through any internal safety reporting programs.

(c) *Management of change.* (1) A transit agency must establish a process for identifying and assessing changes that may introduce new hazards or impact the transit agency's safety performance.

(2) If a transit agency determines that a change may impact its safety performance, then the transit agency must evaluate the proposed change through its Safety Risk Management process.

(d) *Continuous improvement.* (1) A transit agency must establish a process to assess its safety performance.

(2) If a transit agency identifies any deficiencies as part of its safety performance assessment, then the transit agency must develop and carry out, under the direction of the Accountable Executive, a plan to address the identified safety deficiencies.
