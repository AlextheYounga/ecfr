##### ยง 639.31 Early lease termination or modification. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a capital lease under this part is terminated or its terms substantially modified before the end of the period used in the cost-effectiveness evaluation, or if the recipient by an affirmative act or omission vitiates the cost-effectiveness determination of the lease, future lease costs will no longer qualify as eligible capital expenses. In addition, the recipient must reimburse the project -

(1) Any Federal funds paid for the portion of the lease term eliminated by early termination; and

(2) The Federal share of the excess, if any, of the present value of lease costs, which exceeds the purchase costs as calculated under subpart C of this part for the period of the lease up to the point of termination.

(b) Penalties resulting from early termination of a capital lease under this part are not eligible for Federal financial assistance.

(c) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply if a lessor defaults on or otherwise does not meet its obligations under the capital lease and the recipient takes appropriate action to ensure that the procurement continues to be cost-effective. FTA shall be notified of any such event.
