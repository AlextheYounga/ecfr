(2) There is or will be no existing Federal interest in the capital asset as of the date the lease will take effect unless as determined pursuant to ยง 639.13(b); and

(3) Lease of the capital asset is more cost-effective than purchase or construction of the asset, as determined under subpart C of this part.
