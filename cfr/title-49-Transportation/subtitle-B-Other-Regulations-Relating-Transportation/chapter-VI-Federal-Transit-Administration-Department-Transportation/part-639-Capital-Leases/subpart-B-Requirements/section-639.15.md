##### ยง 639.15 Eligible forms of grant. #####

A recipient may choose to receive capital assistance for a capital lease approved under this part -

(a) In a single grant under which lease payments may be drawn down periodically for the life of the lease; or

(b) In increments that are obligated by FTA periodically (usually in annual section 9 grants). In this case, a recipient -

(1) Must certify to FTA that it has the financial capacity to meet its future obligations under the lease in the event Federal funds are not available for capital assistance in subsequent years; and

(2) May incur costs under its lease before FTA's obligation of future increments of funding for such a lease. These costs are reimbursable in future grants, so long as the terms of the lease do not substantially change.
