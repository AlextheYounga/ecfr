##### § 107.117 Emergency processing. #####

(a) An application is granted emergency processing if the Associate Administrator, on the basis of the application and any inquiry undertaken, finds that -

(1) Emergency processing is necessary to prevent significant injury to persons or property (other than the hazardous material to be transported) that could not be prevented if the application were processed on a routine basis; or

(2) Emergency processing is necessary for immediate national security purposes or to prevent significant economic loss that could not be prevented if the application were processed on a routine basis.

(b) Where the significant economic loss is to the applicant, or to a party in a contractual relationship to the applicant with respect to the activity to be undertaken, the Associate Administrator may deny emergency processing if timely application could have been made.

(c) A request for emergency processing on the basis of potential economic loss must reasonably describe and estimate the potential loss.

(d) An application submitted under this section must conform to § 107.105 to the extent that the receiving Department official deems necessary to process the application. An application on an emergency basis must be submitted to the Department modal contact official for the initial mode of transportation to be utilized, as follows:

The Associate Administrator will review an application for emergency processing of a special permit in conformance with the standard operating procedures specified in appendix A of this part (“Standard Operating Procedures for Special Permits and Approvals”) to determine if it is complete and conforms with the requirements of this subpart.
