If a recipient agency fails to comply with any term of an award (whether stated in a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, a State plan or application, a notice of award, or elsewhere) a noncompliance action may be taken as specified in 40 CFR 18.43. The recipient agency may appeal any such actions as specified in 49 CFR part 18. Costs incurred by the recipient agency during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the Associate Administrator authorizes it in writing. Grant awards may be terminated in whole or in part with the consent of the recipient at any agreed upon effective date, or by the recipient upon written notification.
