##### ยง 110.90 Grant monitoring, reports, and records retention. #####

(a) *Grant monitoring.* Project managers are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of grant, subgrant and contract-supported activities. Project managers must monitor performance of supported activities to assure compliance with applicable Federal requirements and achievement of performance goals. Monitoring must cover each program, function, activity, or task covered by the grant. Monitoring and reporting requirements for planning and training are contained in this part; general grant reporting requirements are specified in 49 CFR 18.40.

(b) *Reports.* (1) The project manager shall submit a performance report at the completion of an activity for which reimbursement is being requested or with a request to amend the grant. The final performance report is due 90 days after the expiration or termination of the grant.

(2) Project managers shall submit an original and two copies of all performance reports. Performance reports for planning and training must include comparison of actual accomplishments to the stated goals and objectives established for the performance period, and the reasons for not achieving those goals and objectives, if applicable.

(3) Project managers shall report developments or events that occur between the required performance reporting dates which have significant impact upon the planning and training activity such as:

(i) Problems, delays, or adverse conditions which will impair the ability to meet the objective of the grant; and

(ii) Favorable developments which enable meeting time schedules and objectives sooner or at less cost than anticipated or producing more beneficial results than originally planned.

(4) Financial reporting, except as provided in ยง 110.70 and 49 CFR 18.41, shall be supplied quarterly using Standard Form 270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, to report the status of funds. The project manager shall report separately on planning and training.

(c) *Records retention.* In accordance with 49 CFR 18.42, all financial and programmatic records, supporting documents, statistical records, training materials, and other documents generated under a grant shall be maintained by the project manager for three years from the date the project manager submits the final financial status report (SF 269) or Request for Advance or Reimbursement (SF 270). The project manager shall designate a repository and single-point of contact for planning and for training, or both, for these purposes. If any litigation, claim, negotiation, audit or other action involving the records has been started before the expiration of the 3-year period, the records must be retained until completion of the action and resolution of all issues which arise from it, or until the end of the regular 3-year period, whichever is later.
