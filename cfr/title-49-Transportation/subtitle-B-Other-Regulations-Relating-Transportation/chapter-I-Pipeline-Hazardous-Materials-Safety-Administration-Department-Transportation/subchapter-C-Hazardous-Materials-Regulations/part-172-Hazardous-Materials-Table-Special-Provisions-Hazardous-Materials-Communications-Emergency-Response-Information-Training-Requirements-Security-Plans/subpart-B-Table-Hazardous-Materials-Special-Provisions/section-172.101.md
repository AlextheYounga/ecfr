##### § 172.101 Purpose and use of hazardous materials table. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 25472, Apr. 10, 2024.

(a) The Hazardous Materials Table (Table) in this section designates the materials listed therein as hazardous materials for the purpose of transportation of those materials. For each listed material, the Table identifies the hazard class or specifies that the material is forbidden in transportation, and gives the proper shipping name or directs the user to the preferred proper shipping name. In addition, the Table specifies or references requirements in this subchapter pertaining to labeling, packaging, quantity limits aboard aircraft and stowage of hazardous materials aboard vessels.

(b) *Column 1: Symbols.* Column 1 of the Table contains six symbols (“ + ”, “A”, “D”, “G”, “I” and “W”) as follows:

(1) The plus (+) sign fixes the proper shipping name, hazard class and packing group for that entry without regard to whether the material meets the definition of that class, packing group or any other hazard class definition. When the plus sign is assigned to a proper shipping name in Column (1) of the § 172.101 Table, it means that the material is known to pose a risk to humans. When a plus sign is assigned to mixtures or solutions containing a material where the hazard to humans is significantly different from that of the pure material or where no hazard to humans is posed, the material may be described using an alternative shipping name that represents the hazards posed by the material. An appropriate alternate proper shipping name and hazard class may be authorized by the Associate Administrator.

(2) The letter “A” denotes a material that is subject to the requirements of this subchapter only when offered or intended for transportation by aircraft, unless the material is a hazardous substance or a hazardous waste. A shipping description entry preceded by an “A” may be used to describe a material for other modes of transportation provided all applicable requirements for the entry are met.

(3) The letter “D” identifies proper shipping names which are appropriate for describing materials for domestic transportation but may be inappropriate for international transportation under the provisions of international regulations (e.g., IMO, ICAO). An alternate proper shipping name may be selected when either domestic or international transportation is involved.

(4) The letter “G” identifies proper shipping names for which one or more technical names of the hazardous material must be entered in parentheses, in association with the basic description. (See § 172.203(k).)

(5) The letter “I” identifies proper shipping names which are appropriate for describing materials in international transportation. An alternate proper shipping name may be selected when only domestic transportation is involved.

(6) The letter “W” denotes a material that is subject to the requirements of this subchapter only when offered or intended for transportation by vessel, unless the material is a hazardous substance or a hazardous waste. A shipping description entry preceded by a “W” may be used to describe a material for other modes of transportation provided all applicable requirements for the entry are met.

(c) *Column 2: Hazardous materials descriptions and proper shipping names.* Column 2 lists the hazardous materials descriptions and proper shipping names of materials designated as hazardous materials. Modification of a proper shipping name may otherwise be required or authorized by this section. Proper shipping names are limited to those shown in Roman type (not italics).

(1) Proper shipping names may be used in the singular or plural and in either capital or lower case letters. Words may be alternatively spelled in the same manner as they appear in the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code. For example “aluminum” may be spelled “aluminium” and “sulfur” may be spelled “sulphur”. However, the word “inflammable” may not be used in place of the word “flammable”.

(2) Punctuation marks and words in italics are not part of the proper shipping name, but may be used in addition to the proper shipping name. The word “or” in italics indicates that there is a choice of terms in the sequence that may alternately be used as the proper shipping name or as part of the proper shipping name, as appropriate. For example, for the hazardous materials description “Carbon dioxide, solid or Dry ice” either “Carbon dioxide, solid” or “Dry ice” may be used as the proper shipping name; and for the hazardous materials description “Articles, pressurized pneumatic or hydraulic,” either “Articles, pressurized pneumatic” or “Articles, pressurized hydraulic” may be used as the proper shipping name.

(3) The word “poison” or “poisonous” may be used interchangeably with the word “toxic” when only domestic transportation is involved. The abbreviation “n.o.i.” or “n.o.i.b.n.” may be used interchangeably with “n.o.s.”.

(4) Except for hazardous wastes, when qualifying words are used as part of the proper shipping name, their sequence in the package markings and shipping paper description is optional. However, the entry in the Table reflects the preferred sequence.

(5) When one entry references another entry by use of the word “see”, if both names are in Roman type, either name may be used as the proper shipping name (e.g., Ethyl alcohol, *see* Ethanol).

(6) When a proper shipping name includes a concentration range as part of the shipping description, the actual concentration, if it is within the range stated, may be used in place of the concentration range. For example, an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide containing 30 percent peroxide may be described as “Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solution *with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide”* or “Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solution *with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide.*” Also, the percent sign (%) may be used in place of the word “percent” when words in italics containing the word “percent” are used in addition to the proper shipping name.

(7) Use of the prefix “mono” is optional in any shipping name, when appropriate. Thus, Iodine monochloride may be used interchangeably with Iodine chloride. In “Glycerol alpha-monochlorohydrin” the term “mono” is considered a prefix to the term “chlorohydrin” and may be deleted.

(8) Use of the word “liquid” or “solid”. The word “liquid” or “solid” may be added to a proper shipping name when a hazardous material specifically listed by name may, due to differing physical states, be a liquid or solid. When the packaging specified in Column 8 is inappropriate for the physical state of the material, the table provided in paragraph (i)(4) of this section should be used to determine the appropriate packaging section.

(9) *Hazardous wastes.* If the word “waste” is not included in the hazardous material description in Column 2 of the Table, the proper shipping name for a hazardous waste (as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter), shall include the word “Waste” preceding the proper shipping name of the material. For example: Waste acetone.

(10) *Mixtures and solutions.* (i) A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more hazard class that is not identified specifically by name, comprised of a single predominant hazardous material identified in the Table by technical name and one or more hazardous and/or non-hazardous material, must be described using the proper shipping name of the hazardous material and the qualifying word “mixture” or “solution”, as appropriate, unless—

(A) Except as provided in § 172.101(i)(4) the packaging specified in Column 8 is inappropriate to the physical state of the material;

(B) The shipping description indicates that the proper shipping name applies only to the pure or technically pure hazardous material;

(C) The hazard class, packing group, or subsidiary hazard of the mixture or solution is different from that specified for the entry;

(D) There is a significant change in the measures to be taken in emergencies;

(E) The material is identified by special provision in Column 7 of the § 172.101 Table as a material poisonous by inhalation; however, it no longer meets the definition of poisonous by inhalation or it falls within a different hazard zone than that specified in the special provision; or

(F) The material can be appropriately described by a shipping name that describes its intended application, such as “Coating solution”, “Extracts, flavoring” or “Compound, cleaning liquid.”.

(ii) If one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(10)(i)(A) through (F) of this section is satisfied then the proper shipping name selection process in (c)(12)(ii) must be used.

(iii) A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more hazard class that is not identified in the Table specifically by name, comprised of two or more hazardous materials in the same hazard class, must be described using an appropriate shipping description (e.g., “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.”). The name that most appropriately describes the material shall be used; e.g., an alcohol not listed by its technical name in the Table shall be described as “Alcohol, n.o.s.” rather than “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.”. Some mixtures may be more appropriately described according to their application, such as “Coating solution” or “Extracts, flavoring liquid” rather than by an n.o.s. entry. Under the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the technical names of at least two components most predominately contributing to the hazards of the mixture or solution may be required in association with the proper shipping name.

(11) Except for a material subject to or prohibited by § 173.21, § 173.54, § 173.56(d), § 173.56(e), § 173.224(c) or § 173.225(b) of this subchapter, a material that is considered to be a hazardous waste or a sample of a material for which the hazard class is uncertain and must be determined by testing may be assigned a tentative proper shipping name, hazard class, identification number and packing group, if applicable, based on the shipper's tentative determination according to:

(i) Defining criteria in this subchapter;

(ii) The hazard precedence prescribed in § 173.2a of this subchapter;

(iii) The shipper's knowledge of the material;

(iv) In addition to paragraphs (c)(11)(i) through (iii) of this section, for a sample of a material other than a waste, the following must be met:

(A) Except when the word “Sample” already appears in the proper shipping name, the word “Sample” must appear as part of the proper shipping name or in association with the basic description on the shipping paper.

(B) When the proper shipping description for a sample is assigned a “G” in Column (1) of the § 172.101 Table, and the primary constituent(s) for which the tentative classification is based are not known, the provisions requiring a technical name for the constituent(s) do not apply; and

(C) A sample must be transported in a combination packaging that conforms to the requirements of this subchapter that are applicable to the tentative packing group assigned, and may not exceed a net mass of 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) per package.

Note to paragraph (c)(11):

For the transportation of samples of self-reactive materials, organic peroxides, explosives or lighters, *see* § 173.224(c)(3), § 173.225(c)(2), § 173.56(d) or § 173.308(b)(2) of this subchapter, respectively.

(12) Except when the proper shipping name in the Table is preceded by a plus (+)—

(i) If it is specifically determined that a material meets the definition of a hazard class, packing group or hazard zone, other than the class, packing group or hazard zone shown in association with the proper shipping name, or does not meet the defining criteria for a subsidiary hazard shown in Column 6 of the Table, the material shall be described by an appropriate proper shipping name listed in association with the correct hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or subsidiary hazard for the material.

(ii) *Generic or n.o.s. descriptions.* If an appropriate technical name is not shown in the Table, selection of a proper shipping name shall be made from the generic or n.o.s. descriptions corresponding to the specific hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or subsidiary hazard, if any, for the material. The name that most appropriately describes the material shall be used; e.g., an alcohol not listed by its technical name in the Table shall be described as “Alcohol, n.o.s.” rather than “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.”. Some mixtures may be more appropriately described according to their application, such as “Coating solution” or “Extracts, flavoring, liquid”, rather than by an n.o.s. entry, such as “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.” It should be noted, however, that an n.o.s. description as a proper shipping name may not provide sufficient information for shipping papers and package markings. Under the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the technical name of one or more constituents which makes the product a hazardous material may be required in association with the proper shipping name.

(iii) *Multiple hazard materials.* If a material meets the definition of more than one hazard class, and is not identified in the Table specifically by name (e.g., acetyl chloride), the hazard class of the material shall be determined by using the precedence specified in § 173.2a of this subchapter, and an appropriate shipping description (e.g., “Flammable liquid, corrosive n.o.s.”) shall be selected as described in paragraph (c)(12)(ii) of this section.

(iv) If it is specifically determined that a material is not a forbidden material and does not meet the definition of any hazard class, the material is not a hazardous material.

(13) *Self-reactive materials and organic peroxides.* A generic proper shipping name for a self-reactive material or an organic peroxide, as listed in Column 2 of the Table, must be selected based on the material's technical name and concentration, in accordance with the provisions of § 173.224 or § 173.225 of this subchapter, respectively.

(14) A proper shipping name that describes all isomers of a material may be used to identify any isomer of that material if the isomer meets criteria for the same hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) and packing group, unless the isomer is specifically identified in the Table.

(15) Unless a hydrate is specifically listed in the Table, a proper shipping name for the equivalent anhydrous substance may be used, if the hydrate meets the same hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) and packing group.

(16) Unless it is already included in the proper shipping name in the § 172.101 Table, the qualifying words “liquid” or “solid” may be added in association with the proper shipping name when a hazardous material specifically listed by name in the § 172.101 Table may, due to the differing physical states of the various isomers of the material, be either a liquid or a solid (for example “Dinitrotoluenes, liquid” and “Dinitrotoluenes, solid”). Use of the words “liquid” or “solid” is subject to the limitations specified for the use of the words “mixture” or “solution” in paragraph (c)(10) of this section. The qualifying word “molten” may be added in association with the proper shipping name when a hazardous material, which is a solid in accordance with the definition in § 171.8 of this subchapter, is offered for transportation in the molten state (for example, “Alkylphenols, solid, n.o.s., molten”).

(17) Unless it is already included in the proper shipping name in the § 172.101 Table, the qualifying word “stabilized” may be added in association with the proper shipping name, as appropriate, where without stabilization the substance would be forbidden for transportation according to § 173.21(f) of this subchapter.

(d) *Column 3: Hazard class or Division.* Column 3 contains a designation of the hazard class or division corresponding to each proper shipping name, or the word “Forbidden”.

(1) A material for which the entry in this column is “Forbidden” may not be offered for transportation or transported. This prohibition does not apply if the material is diluted, stabilized or incorporated in a device and it is classed in accordance with the definitions of hazardous materials contained in part 173 of this subchapter.

(2) When a reevaluation of test data or new data indicates a need to modify the “Forbidden” designation or the hazard class or packing group specified for a material specifically identified in the Table, this data should be submitted to the Associate Administrator.

(3) A basic description of each hazard class and the section reference for class definitions appear in § 173.2 of this subchapter.

(4) Each reference to a Class 3 material is modified to read “Combustible liquid” when that material is reclassified in accordance with § 173.150(e) or (f) of this subchapter or has a flash point above 60 °C (140 °F) but below 93 °C (200 °F).

(e) *Column 4: Identification number.* Column 4 lists the identification number assigned to each proper shipping name. Those preceded by the letters “UN” are associated with proper shipping names considered appropriate for international transportation as well as domestic transportation. Those preceded by the letters “NA” are associated with proper shipping names not recognized for transportation outside of the United States. Identification numbers in the “NA9000” series are associated with proper shipping names not appropriately covered by international hazardous materials (dangerous goods) transportation standards, or not appropriately addressed by international transportation standards for emergency response information purposes, except for transportation in the United States. Those preceded by the letters “ID” are associated with proper shipping names recognized by the ICAO Technical Instructions (see § 171.7 of this subchapter for availability).

(f) *Column 5: Packing group.* Column 5 specifies one or more packing groups assigned to a material corresponding to the proper shipping name and hazard class for that material. Class 2, Class 7, and Division 6.2 do not have packing groups. Articles in classes other than Class 1 are not assigned to packing groups. For packing purposes, any requirement for a specific packaging performance level is set out in the applicable packing authorizations of part 173. Packing Groups I, II, and III indicate the degree of danger presented by the material is great, medium, or minor, respectively. If more than one packing group is indicated for an entry, the packing group for the hazardous material is determined using the criteria for assignment of packing groups specified in subpart D of part 173. When a reevaluation of test data or new data indicates a need to modify the specified packing group(s), the data should be submitted to the Associate Administrator. Each reference in this column to a material that is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose proper shipping name preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter “A” or “W,” is modified to read “III” on those occasions when the material is offered for transportation or transported by a mode in which its transportation is not otherwise subject to requirements of this subchapter.

(g) *Column 6: Labels.* Column 6 specifies codes which represent the hazard warning labels required for a package filled with a material conforming to the associated hazard class and proper shipping name, unless the package is otherwise excepted from labeling by a provision in subpart E of this part, or part 173 of this subchapter. The first code is indicative of the primary hazard of the material. Additional label codes are indicative of subsidiary hazards. Provisions in § 172.402 may require that a label other than that specified in Column 6 be affixed to the package in addition to that specified in Column 6. No label is required for a material classed as a combustible liquid or for a Class 3 material that is reclassed as a combustible liquid. For “Empty” label requirements, see § 173.428 of this subchapter. The codes contained in Column 6 are defined according to the following table:

<sup>1</sup> Refers to the appropriate compatibility group letter.

<sup>2</sup> The packing group for a material is indicated in column 5 of the table.

(h) *Column 7: Special provisions.* Column 7 specifies codes for special provisions applicable to hazardous materials. When Column 7 refers to a special provision for a hazardous material, the meaning and requirements of that special provision are as set forth in § 172.102 of this subpart.

(i) *Column 8: Packaging authorizations.* Columns 8A, 8B and 8C specify the applicable sections for exceptions, non-bulk packaging requirements and bulk packaging requirements, respectively, in part 173 of this subchapter. Columns 8A, 8B and 8C are completed in a manner which indicates that “§ 173.” precedes the designated numerical entry. For example, the entry “202” in Column 8B associated with the proper shipping name “Gasoline” indicates that for this material conformance to non-bulk packaging requirements prescribed in § 173.202 of this subchapter is required. When packaging requirements are specified, they are in addition to the standard requirements for all packagings prescribed in § 173.24 of this subchapter and any other applicable requirements in subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter.

(1) Exceptions. Column 8A contains exceptions from some of the requirements of this subchapter. The referenced exceptions are in addition to those specified in subpart A of part 173 and elsewhere in this subchapter. A “None” in this column means no packaging exceptions are authorized, except as may be provided by special provisions in Column 7.

(2) Non-bulk packaging. Column 8B references the section in part 173 of this subchapter which prescribes packaging requirements for non-bulk packagings. A “None” in this column means non-bulk packagings are not authorized, except as may be provided by special provisions in Column 7. Each reference in this column to a material which is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose proper shipping name is preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter “A” or “W”, is modified to include “§ 173.203” or “§ 173.213”, as appropriate for liquids and solids, respectively, on those occasions when the material is offered for transportation or transported by a mode in which its transportation is not otherwise subject to the requirements of this subchapter.

(3) *Bulk packaging.* Column (8C) specifies the section in part 173 of this subchapter that prescribes packaging requirements for bulk packagings, subject to the limitations, requirements, and additional authorizations of Columns (7) and (8B). A “None” in Column (8C) means bulk packagings are not authorized, except as may be provided by special provisions in Column (7) and in packaging authorizations Column (8B). Additional authorizations and limitations for use of UN portable tanks are set forth in Column 7. For each reference in this column to a material that is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose proper shipping name is preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter “A” or “W” and that is offered for transportation or transported by a mode in which its transportation is not otherwise subject to the requirements of this subchapter:

(i) The column reference is § 173.240 or § 173.241, as appropriate.

(ii) For a solid material, the exception provided in special provision B54 is applicable.

(iii) For a Class 9 material, which meets the definition of an elevated temperature material, the column reference is § 173.247.

(4) For a hazardous material which is specifically named in the Table and whose packaging sections specify packagings not applicable to the form of the material (e.g., packaging specified is for solid material and the material is being offered for transportation in a liquid form) the following table should be used to determine the appropriate packaging section:

|Packaging section reference for solid materials|Corresponding packaging section for liquid materials|
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|                   § 173.187                   |                     § 173.181                      |
|                   § 173.211                   |                     § 173.201                      |
|                   § 173.212                   |                     § 173.202                      |
|                   § 173.213                   |                     § 173.203                      |
|                   § 173.240                   |                     § 173.241                      |
|                   § 173.242                   |                     § 173.243                      |

(5) *Cylinders.* For cylinders, both non-bulk and bulk packaging authorizations are set forth in Column (8B). Notwithstanding a designation of “None” in Column (8C), a bulk cylinder may be used when specified through the section reference in Column (8B).

(j) *Column 9: Quantity limitations.* Columns 9A and 9B specify the maximum quantities that may be offered for transportation in one package by passenger-carrying aircraft or passenger-carrying rail car (Column 9A) or by cargo aircraft only (Column 9B), subject to the following:

(1) “Forbidden” means the material may not be offered for transportation or transported in the applicable mode of transport.

(2) The quantity limitation is “net” except where otherwise specified, such as for “Consumer commodity” which specifies “30 kg gross.”

(3) When articles or devices are specifically listed by name, the net quantity limitation applies to the entire article or device (less packaging and packaging materials) rather than only to its hazardous components.

(4) A package offered or intended for transportation by aircraft and which is filled with a material forbidden on passenger-carrying aircraft but permitted on cargo aircraft only, or which exceeds the maximum net quantity authorized on passenger-carrying aircraft, shall be labelled with the CARGO AIRCRAFT ONLY label specified in § 172.448 of this part.

(5) The total net quantity of hazardous material for an outer non-bulk packaging that contains more than one hazardous material may not exceed the lowest permitted maximum net quantity per package as shown in Column 9A or 9B, as appropriate. If one material is a liquid and one is a solid, the maximum net quantity must be calculated in kilograms. *See* § 173.24a(c)(1)(iv).

(k) *Column 10: Vessel stowage requirements.* Column 10A [Vessel stowage] specifies the authorized stowage locations on board cargo and passenger vessels. Column 10B [Other provisions] specifies codes for stowage and handling requirements for specific hazardous materials. Hazardous materials offered for transportation as limited quantities are allocated stowage category A and are not subject to the stowage codes assigned by column 10B. The meaning of each code in Column 10B is set forth in § 176.84 of this subchapter. Section 176.63 of this subchapter sets forth the physical requirements for each of the authorized locations listed in Column 10A. (For bulk transportation by vessel, see 46 CFR parts 30 to 40, 70, 98, 148, 151, 153 and 154.) The authorized stowage locations specified in Column 10A are defined as follows:

(1) Stowage category “A” means the material may be stowed “on deck” or “under deck” on a cargo vessel or on a passenger vessel.

(2) Stowage category “B” means—

(i) The material may be stowed “on deck” or “under deck” on a cargo vessel and on a passenger vessel carrying a number of passengers limited to not more than the larger of 25 passengers, or one passenger per each 3 m of overall vessel length; and

(ii) “On deck only” on passenger vessels in which the number of passengers specified in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section is exceeded.

(3) Stowage category “C” means the material must be stowed “on deck only” on a cargo vessel or on a passenger vessel.

(4) Stowage category “D” means the material must be stowed “on deck only” on a cargo vessel or on a passenger vessel carrying a number of passengers limited to not more than the larger of 25 passengers or one passenger per each 3 m of overall vessel length, but the material is prohibited on a passenger vessel in which the limiting number of passengers is exceeded.

(5) Stowage category “E” means the material may be stowed “on deck” or “under deck” on a cargo vessel or on a passenger vessel carrying a number of passengers limited to not more than the larger of 25 passengers, or one passenger per each 3 m of overall vessel length, but is prohibited from carriage on a passenger vessel in which the limiting number of passengers is exceeded.

(6) Stowage category “01” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) or on a passenger vessel.

(7) Stowage category “02” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) or “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” in closed cargo transport units on a passenger vessel.

(8) Stowage category “03” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) but the material is prohibited on a passenger vessel.

(9) Stowage category “04” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units or “under deck” in closed cargo transports on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) but the material is prohibited on a passenger vessel.

(10) Stowage category “05” means the material may be stowed “on deck” in closed cargo transport units on a cargo vessel (up to 12 passengers) but the material is prohibited on a passenger vessel.

(l) *Changes to the Table.* (1) Unless specifically stated otherwise in a rule document published in the Federal Register amending the Table—

(i) Such a change does not apply to the shipment of any package filled prior to the effective date of the amendment; and

(ii) Stocks of preprinted shipping papers and package markings may be continued in use, in the manner previously authorized, until depleted or for a one-year period, subsequent to the effective date of the amendment, whichever is less.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this section, any alteration of a shipping description or associated entry which is listed in the § 172.101 Table must receive prior written approval from the Associate Administrator.

(3) The proper shipping name of a hazardous material changed in the May 6, 1997 final rule, in effect on October 1, 1997, only by the addition or omission of the word “compressed,” “inhibited,” “liquefied” or “solution” may continue to be used to comply with package marking requirements, until January 1, 2003.

Appendix A to § 172.101—List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities

1. This appendix lists materials and their corresponding reportable quantities (RQ's) that are listed or designated as “hazardous substances” under section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14) (CERCLA; 42 U.S.C. 9601 *et seq*). This listing fulfills the requirement of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), that all “hazardous substances,” as defined in 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), be listed and regulated as hazardous materials under 49 U.S.C. 5101-5127. That definition includes substances listed under sections 311(b)(2)(A) and 307(a) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A) and 1317(a), section 3001 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6921, and section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412. In addition, this list contains materials that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has determined to be hazardous substances in accordance with section 102 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9602. It should be noted that 42 U.S.C. 9656(b) provides that common and contract carriers may be held liable under laws other than CERCLA for the release of a hazardous substance as defined in that Act, during transportation that commenced before the effective date of the listing and regulating of that substance as a hazardous material under 49 U.S.C. 5101-5127.

2. This appendix is divided into two TABLES which are entitled “TABLE 1—HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN RADIONUCLIDES” and “TABLE 2—RADIONUCLIDES.” A material listed in this appendix is regulated as a hazardous material and a hazardous substance under this subchapter if it meets the definition of a hazardous substance in § 171.8 of this subchapter.

3. The procedure for selecting a proper shipping name for a hazardous substance is set forth in § 172.101(c).

4. Column 1 of TABLE 1, entitled *“Hazardous substance”,* contains the names of those elements and compounds that are hazardous substances. Following the listing of elements and compounds is a listing of waste streams. These waste streams appear on the list in numerical sequence and are referenced by the appropriate “D”, “F”, or “K” numbers. Column 2 of TABLE 1, entitled *“Reportable quantity (RQ)”,* contains the reportable quantity (RQ), in pounds and kilograms, for each hazardous substance listed in Column 1 of TABLE 1.

5. A series of notes is used throughout TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 to provide additional information concerning certain hazardous substances. These notes are explained at the end of each TABLE.

6. TABLE 2 lists radionuclides that are hazardous substances and their corresponding RQ's. The RQ's in table 2 for radionuclides are expressed in units of curies and terabecquerels, whereas those in table 1 are expressed in units of pounds and kilograms. If a material is listed in both table 1 and table 2, the lower RQ shall apply. Radionuclides are listed in alphabetical order. The RQ's for radionuclides are given in the radiological unit of measure of curie, abbreviated “Ci”, followed, in parentheses, by an equivalent unit measured in terabecquerels, abbreviated “TBq”.

7. For mixtures of radionuclides, the following requirements shall be used in determining if a package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance: (i) if the identity and quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of each radionuclide in a mixture or solution is known, the ratio between the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) and the RQ for the radionuclide must be determined for each radionuclide. A package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance when the sum of the ratios for the radionuclides in the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than one; (ii) if the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture or solution is known but the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) of one or more of the radionuclides is unknown, an RQ of a hazardous substance is present in a package when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than the lowest RQ of any individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution; and (iii) if the identity of one or more radionuclides in a mixture or solution is unknown (or if the identity of a radionuclide by itself is unknown), an RQ of a hazardous substance is present when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) in a package is equal to or greater than either one curie or the lowest RQ of any known individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution, whichever is lower.

$ The RQs for all radionuclides apply to chemical compounds containing the radionuclides and elemental forms regardless of the diameter of pieces of solid material.

† The RQ of one curie applies to all radionuclides not otherwise listed. Whenever the RQs in TABLE 1—HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN RADIONUCLIDES and this table conflict, the lowest RQ shall apply. For example, uranyl acetate and uranyl nitrate have RQs shown in TABLE 1 of 100 pounds, equivalent to about one-tenth the RQ level for uranium-238 in this table.

\*\* The method to determine the RQs for mixtures or solutions of radionuclides can be found in paragraph 7 of the note preceding TABLE 1 of this appendix. RQs for the following four common radionuclide mixtures are provided: radium-226 in secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.053 curie); natural uranium (0.1 curie); natural uranium in secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.052 curie); and natural thorium in secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.011 curie).

\*\*\* Indicates that the name was added by PHMSA because it appears in the list of radionuclides in 49 CFR 173.435. The reportable quantity (RQ), if not specifically listed elsewhere in this appendix, shall be determined in accordance with the procedures in paragraph 7 of this appendix.

Appendix B to § 172.101—List of Marine Pollutants

1. See § 171.4 of this subchapter for applicability to marine pollutants. This appendix lists potential marine pollutants as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter.

2. Marine pollutants listed in this appendix are not necessarily listed by name in the § 172.101 Table. If a marine pollutant not listed by name or by synonym in the § 172.101 Table meets the definition of any hazard Class 1 through 8, then you must determine the class and division of the material in accordance with § 173.2a of this subchapter. You must also select the most appropriate hazardous material description and proper shipping name. If a marine pollutant not listed by name or by synonym in the § 172.101 Table does not meet the definition of any Class 1 through 8, then you must offer it for transportation under the most appropriate of the following two Class 9 entries: “Environmentally hazardous substances, liquid, n.o.s.,” UN3082, or “Environmentally hazardous substances, solid, n.o.s.” UN3077.

3. This appendix contains two columns. The first column, entitled “S.M.P.” (for severe marine pollutants), identifies whether a material is a severe marine pollutant. If the letters “PP” appear in this column for a material, the material is a severe marine pollutant, otherwise it is not. The second column, entitled “Marine Pollutant” , lists the marine pollutants.

4. If a material is not listed in this appendix and meets the criteria for a marine pollutant as provided in Chapter 2.9 of the IMDG Code, (incorporated by reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), the material may be transported as a marine pollutant in accordance with the applicable requirements of this subchapter.

5. If a material or a solution meeting the definition of a marine pollutant in § 171.8 of this subchapter does not meet the criteria for a marine pollutant as provided in section 2.9.3.3 and 2.9.3.4 of the IMDG Code, (incorporated by reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), it may be excepted from the requirements of this subchapter as a marine pollutant if that exception is approved by the Associate Administrator.
