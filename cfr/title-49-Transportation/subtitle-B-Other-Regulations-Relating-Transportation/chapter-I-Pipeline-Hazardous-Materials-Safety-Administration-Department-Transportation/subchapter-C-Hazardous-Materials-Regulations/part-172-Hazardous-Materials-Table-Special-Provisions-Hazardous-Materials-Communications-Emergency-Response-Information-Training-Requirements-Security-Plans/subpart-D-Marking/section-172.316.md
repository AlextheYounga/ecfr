##### § 172.316 Packagings containing materials classed as ORM-D. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 79772, Dec. 27, 2022.

(a) Each non-bulk packaging containing a material classed as ORM-D must be marked on at least one side or end with the ORM-D designation immediately following or below the proper shipping name of the material. The ORM designation must be placed within a rectangle that is approximately 6.3 mm (0.25 inches) larger on each side than the designation. Until December 31, 2020, the designation ORM-D is for an ORM-D material, as defined in § 173.144, that is packaged in accordance with §§ 173.63(b), 173.150 through 173.156, and 173.306.

(b) When the ORM-D marking including the proper shipping name can not be affixed on the package surface, it may be on an attached tag.

(c) The marking ORM-D is the certification by the person offering the packaging for transportation that the material is properly described, classed, packaged, marked and labeled (when appropriate) and in proper condition for transportation according to the applicable regulations of this subchapter. This form of certification does not preclude the requirement for a certificate on a shipping paper when required by subpart C of this part.
