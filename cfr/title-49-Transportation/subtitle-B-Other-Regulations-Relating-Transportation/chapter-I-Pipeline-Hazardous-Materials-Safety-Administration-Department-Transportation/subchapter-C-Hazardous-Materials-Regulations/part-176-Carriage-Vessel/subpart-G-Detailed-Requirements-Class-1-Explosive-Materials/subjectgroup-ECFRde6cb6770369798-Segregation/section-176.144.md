Explosive articles in compatibility group G, other than fireworks, may be stowed with articles of compatibility groups C, D, and E, provided no explosive substances are carried in the same compartment, magazine or cargo transport unit.                                                                                                                                    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|                                                                                                                                                                          2. Explosives in compatibility group L may only be stowed in the same compartment, magazine or cargo transport unit with identical explosives within compatibility group L.                                                                                                                                                                           |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|                                                                                                                                   3. Different types of articles of Division 1.6, compatibility group N, may only be transported together when it is proven that there is no additional risk of sympathetic detonation between the articles. Otherwise they must be treated as division 1.1.                                                                                                                                   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|                                                                                                                                                             4. When articles of compatibility group N are transported with articles or substances of compatibility groups C, D or E, the goods of compatibility group N must be treated as compatibility group D.                                                                                                                                                              |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|                                                                                                                                                                       5. When articles of compatibility group N are transported together with articles or substances of compatibility group S, the entire load must be treated as compatibility group N.                                                                                                                                                                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|6. Any combination of articles in compatibility groups C, D and E must be treated as compatibility group E. Any combination of substances in compatibility groups C and D must be treated as the most appropriate compatibility group shown in Table 2 of ยง 173.52 taking into account the predominant characteristics of the combined load. This overall classification code must be displayed on any label or placard on a unit load or cargo transport unit as prescribed in subpart E (Labeling) and subpart F (Placarding).|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

(b) Where Class 1 (explosive) materials of different compatibility groups are allowed to be stowed in the same compartment, magazine, or cargo transport unit, the stowage arrangements must conform to the most stringent requirements for the entire load.

(c) Where a mixed load of Class 1 (explosive) materials of different hazard divisions and/or stowage arrangements is carried within a compartment, magazine, or cargo transport unit, the entire load must be treated as belonging to the hazard division having the greatest hazard. (For example, if a load of Division 1.1 (explosive) materials is mixed with Division 1.3 (explosive) materials, the load is treated as a Division 1.1 (explosive) material as defined in ยง 173.50(b) of this subchapter and the stowage must conform to the most stringent requirements for the entire load).

(d) If some of the Class 1 (explosive) materials in a stowage mixture require non-metallic lining of the closed cargo transport unit, Class 1 (explosive) materials requiring ordinary stowage may be stowed in the same closed cargo transport. When a closed cargo transport unit is used for such substances that require non-metallic lining of the closed cargo transport unit, the other Class 1 (explosive) materials stowed therein must have no exposed parts of any ferrous metal or aluminum alloy, unless separated by a partition.

(e) Segregation on deck: When Class 1 (explosive) materials in different compatibility groups are carried on deck, they must be stored not less than 6 m (20 feet) apart unless they are allowed under Table 176.144(a) to be stowed in the same compartment, magazine, or cargo transport unit.

(f) On a barge used to transfer class 1 (explosive) materials from a waterfront facility to a vessel at an explosives anchorage (or from the vessel to the water front facility), if compliance with paragraph (e) of this section is not practicable, a sandbag barrier at least 0.6 m (2 feet) in thickness may be substituted for the 6 m (20 feet) separation.
