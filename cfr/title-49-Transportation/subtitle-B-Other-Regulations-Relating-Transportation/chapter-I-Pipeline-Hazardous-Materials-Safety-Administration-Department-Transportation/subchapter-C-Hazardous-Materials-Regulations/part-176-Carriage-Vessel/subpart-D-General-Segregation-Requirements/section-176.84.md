##### § 176.84 Other requirements for stowage, cargo handling, and segregation for cargo vessels and passenger vessels. #####

(a) *General.* When Column 10B of the § 172.101 Table refers to a numbered or alpha-numeric stowage provision for water shipments, the meaning and requirements of that provision are set forth in this section. Terms in quotation marks are defined in § 176.83. Other terms used in the table in this section such as “acids”, “chlorates” and “permanganates” indicate different chemical groups referred to here as segregation groups. Materials falling within a segregation group are considered to have certain similar chemical properties and, although not exhaustive in nature, the materials belonging to each group include those substances identified in section 3.1.4 of the IMDG Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) as set forth in § 176.83(m).

<sup>1</sup> For waste cyanides or waste cyanide mixtures or solutions, refer to § 173.12(e) of this subchapter.

<sup>2</sup> Class 8 materials in PG II or III that otherwise are required to be segregated from one another may be transported in the same cargo transport unit, whether in the same packaging or not, provided the substances do not react dangerously with each other to cause combustion and/or evolution of considerable heat, or of flammable, toxic or asphyxiant gases, or the formation of corrosive or unstable substances; and the package does not contain more than 30 L (7.8 gallons) for liquids or 30 kg (66 lbs.) for solids.

<sup>3</sup> These requirements apply to the loading of hazardous materials in cargo transport units as well as the stowage of cargo transport units.

(c) *Provisions for the stowage of Class 1 (explosive) materials:* (1) Explosive substances and explosive articles must be stowed in accordance with Column (10A) and Column (10B) of the 172.101 Table of this subchapter.

(2) The following notes in column 10B of the § 172.101 Table apply to the transport of Class 1 (explosive) materials by vessel:
