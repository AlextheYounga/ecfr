##### § 176.905 Stowage of motor vehicles or mechanical equipment. #####

(a) A vehicle or any mechanical equipment powered by an internal combustion engine, a fuel cell, batteries or a combination thereof, is subject to the following requirements when carried as cargo on a vessel:

(1) Before being loaded on a vessel, each vehicle or mechanical equipment must be inspected for fuel leaks and identifiable faults in the electrical system that could result in short circuit or other unintended electrical source of ignition. A vehicle or mechanical equipment showing any signs of leakage or electrical fault may not be transported.

(2) The fuel tank of a vehicle or mechanical equipment powered by liquid fuel may not be more than one-fourth full.

(3) Whenever possible, each vehicle or mechanical equipment must be stowed to allow for its inspection during transportation.

(4) Vehicles or mechanical equipment may be refueled when necessary in the hold of a vessel in accordance with § 176.78 of this part.

(b) All equipment used for handling vehicles or mechanical equipment must be designed so that the fuel tank and the fuel system of the vehicle or mechanical equipment are protected from stress that might cause rupture or other damage incident to handling.

(c) Two hand-held, portable, dry chemical fire extinguishers of at least 4.5 kg (10 pounds) capacity each must be separately located in an accessible location in each hold or compartment in which any vehicle or mechanical equipment is stowed.

(d) “NO SMOKING” signs must be conspicuously posted at each access opening to the hold or compartment.

(e) Each portable electrical light, including a flashlight, used in the stowage area must be an approved, explosion-proof type. All electrical connections for any light must be made to outlets outside the space in which any vehicle or mechanical equipment is stowed.

(f) Each hold or compartment must be ventilated and fitted with an overhead water sprinkler system or fixed fire extinguisher system.

(g) Each hold or compartment must be equipped with a smoke or fire detection system capable of alerting personnel on the bridge.

(h) All electrical equipment in the hold or compartment other than fixed explosion-proof lighting must be disconnected from its power source at a location outside the hold or compartment during the handling and transportation of any vehicle or mechanical equipment. Where the disconnecting means is a switch or circuit breaker, it must be locked in the open position until all vehicles have been removed.

(i) *Exceptions.* A vehicle or mechanical equipment is excepted from the requirements of this subchapter if any of the following are met:

(1) The vehicle or mechanical equipment has an internal combustion engine using liquid fuel that has a flashpoint less than 38 °C (100 °F), the fuel tank is empty, installed batteries are protected from short circuit, and the engine is run until it stalls for lack of fuel;

(2) The vehicle or mechanical equipment has an internal combustion engine using liquid fuel that has a flashpoint of 38 °C (100 °F) or higher, the fuel tank contains 450 L (119 gallons) of fuel or less, installed batteries are protected from short circuit, and there are no fuel leaks in any portion of the fuel system;

(3) The vehicle or mechanical equipment is stowed in a hold or compartment designated by the administration of the country in which the vessel is registered as specially designed and approved for vehicles and mechanical equipment and there are no signs of leakage from the battery, engine, fuel cell, compressed gas cylinder or accumulator, or fuel tank, as appropriate. For vehicles with batteries connected and fuel tanks containing gasoline transported by U.S. vessels, see 46 CFR 70.10-1 and 90.10-38;

(4) The vehicle or mechanical equipment is electrically powered solely by wet electric storage batteries (including non-spillable batteries) or sodium batteries and the installed batteries are protected from short circuit;

(5) The vehicle or mechanical equipment is equipped with liquefied petroleum gas or other compressed gas fuel tanks, the tanks are completely emptied of liquefied or compressed gas and the positive pressure in the tank does not exceed 2 bar (29 psig), the fuel shut-off or isolation valve is closed and secured, and installed batteries are protected from short circuit; or

(6) The vehicle or mechanical equipment is powered by a fuel cell engine, the engine is protected from inadvertent operation by closing fuel supply lines or by other means, and the fuel supply reservoir has been drained and sealed.

(j) Except as provided in § 173.220(f) of this subchapter, the provisions of this subchapter do not apply to items of equipment such as fire extinguishers, compressed gas accumulators, airbag inflators and the like which are installed in the vehicle or mechanical equipment if they are necessary for the operation of the vehicle or equipment, or for the safety of its operator or passengers.
