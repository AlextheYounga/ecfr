(a) *Definitions.* For definitions of compressed gases, see § 173.115.

(b) *General requirements.* (1) Tank car tanks containing compressed gases must not be shipped unless they were loaded by or with the consent of the owner thereof.

(2) Tank car tanks must not contain gases capable of combining chemically and must not be loaded with any gas which combines chemically with the gas previously loaded therein, until all residue has been removed and interior of tank thoroughly cleaned.

(3) For tanks of the DOT-106A and 110A class, the tanks must be placed in position and attached to car structure by the shipper.

(4) Wherever the word “approved” is used in this part of the regulations, it means approval by the Association of American Railroads Committee on Tank Cars as prescribed in § 179.3 of this subchapter.

(5) Each tank car used for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia or any material that meets the criteria of Division 2.1 or 2.3 must have gaskets for manway cover plates and for mounting of fittings designed (for temperature, application, media, pressure, and size) to create a positive seal so that, under conditions normally incident to transportation, there will not be an identifiable release of the material to the environment. The use of sealants to install gaskets is prohibited.

(c) *Authorized gases, filling limits for tank cars.* A compressed gas in a tank car or a multi-unit tank car must be offered for transportation in accordance with § 173.31 and this section. The gases listed below must be loaded and offered for transportation in accordance with the following table:

Notes: 1. The percent filling density for liquefied gases is hereby defined as the percent ratio of the mass of gas in the tank to the mass of water that the tank will hold. For determining the water capacity of the tank in kilograms, the mass of 1 L of water at 15.5 °C in air is 1 kg. (the mass of one gallon of water at 60 °F in air is 8.32828 pounds).

2. The liquefied gas must be loaded so that the outage is at least two percent of the total capacity of the tank at the reference temperature of 46 °C (115 °F) for a noninsulated tank; 43 °C (110 °F) for a tank having a thermal protection system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential; and 41 °C (105 °F) for an insulated tank having an insulation system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 1.5333 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential.

3. The requirements of § 173.24b(a) apply.

4. The gas pressure at 54.44 °C (130 °F.) in any non-insulated tank car may not exceed7/10 of the marked test pressure, except that a tank may be charged with helium to a pressure 10 percent in excess of the marked maximum gas pressure at 54.44 °C (130 °F.) of each tank.

5. The liquid portion of the gas at −17.77 °C (0 °F.) must not completely fill the tank.

6. The maximum permitted filling density is 125 percent. The quantity of chlorine loaded into a single unit-tank car may not be loaded in excess of the normal lading weights nor in excess of 81.65 Mg (90 tons).

(2) *Metering device.* (i) Tank cars loaded with anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution through the use of a metering device in conformance with this section are not required to be weighed, but must have their outage measured with a magnetic gauging device to determine that the tank car is properly loaded in conformance with this paragraph. Written procedures for loading a tank car using a metering device must be developed and made available at each location where such loading takes place. Certification in writing of the inspection and completion of these loading and/or unloading procedures must be maintained for each tank car and maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, and all necessary records must be completed. At a minimum, these procedures will specify:

(A) The tank car must be offered for transportation in conformance with all applicable government regulations.

(B) Any defects found when the tank car is examined before shipping must be recorded, and the tank must not be loaded until the repairs to eliminate each defect are completed.

(C) The tank car must be allowed to sit undisturbed for at least 10 minutes after loading to allow material within the tank to settle. After this has occurred a final check for leaks must be conducted prior to offering the tank car for transportation.

(ii) One out of every 10 tank cars loaded by the use of the metering device must be gauged utilizing the fixed gauging equipment on the tank car to verify by calculation the amount of anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution contained in the tank car.

(iii) *Recordkeeping.* The following information must be maintained and be made available to any representative of the DOT upon request for each tank car loaded with the use of a metering device:

(M) Quantity of vapor ammonia in tank car (gallons/liters), and

(N) Total calculated ammonia (liquid & vapor) in tank car (pounds/kilograms).

(f) [Reserved]

(g) Special requirements for hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid, and vinyl fluoride,stabilized.

(1) The shipper shall notify the Federal Railroad Administration whenever a tank car is not received by the consignee within 20 days from the date of shipment. Notification to the Federal Railroad Administration may be made by e-mail to *Hmassist@fra.dot.gov* or telephone call to (202) 493-6229.

(2) A tank car containing hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid must have the auxiliary valve on the pressure relief device closed during transportation.

(3) See § 179.102-17 of this subchapter for additional requirements.

(4) Tank cars containing hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid, must be unloaded to such an extent that any residue remaining in the tank at a reference temperature of 32 °C (90 °F) will not actuate the reclosing pressure relief device.

(h) *Special requirements for liquefied petroleum gas* - (1) *Odorization.* All liquefied petroleum gas must be odorized as required in this paragraph to indicate positively, by a distinctive odor, the presence of gas down to a concentration in air of not over one-fifth the lower limit of combustibility; however, odorization is not required if it is harmful in the use or further processing of the liquefied petroleum gas or if it will serve no useful purpose as a warning agent in such use or further processing.

(i) The lower limits of combustibility of the more commonly used liquefied petroleum gases are: Propane, 2.15 percent; butane, 1.55 percent. These figures represent volumetric percentages of gas-air mixtures in each case.

(ii) The use of 1.0 pound of ethyl mercaptan per 10,000 gallons of liquefied petroleum gas is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph. Use of another odorant is not prohibited so long as there is enough to meet the requirements of this paragraph (h).

(2) *Odorant fade.* In addition to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the offeror must ensure that enough odorant will remain in the tank car during the course of transportation. The shipper must have procedures in place to:

(i) Ensure quantitative testing methods are used to measure the amount of odorant in the liquefied petroleum gas;

(ii) Ensure that, when the odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is manually injected, the required amount of odorant is added;

(iii) Ensure that, when odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is automatically injected, equipment calibration checks are conducted to ensure the required amount of odorant is consistently added;

(iv) Ensure quality control measures are in place to make sure that persons who receive tank cars that have been subjected to any condition that could lead to corrosion of the tank car or receive new or recently cleaned tank cars are notified of this information and that a person filling these packagings implement quality control measures so that potential odorant fade is addressed;

(v) Inspect a tank car for signs of oxidation or corrosion; and

(vi) Take corrective action needed to ensure enough odorization remains in the tank car during the course of transportation, such as increasing the amount of odorant added to the liquefied petroleum gas.

(i) [Reserved]
