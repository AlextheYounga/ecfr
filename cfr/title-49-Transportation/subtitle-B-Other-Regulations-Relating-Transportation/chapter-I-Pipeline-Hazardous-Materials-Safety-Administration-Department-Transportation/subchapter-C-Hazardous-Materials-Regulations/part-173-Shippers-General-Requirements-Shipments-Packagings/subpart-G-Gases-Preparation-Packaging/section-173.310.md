##### § 173.310 Exceptions for radiation detectors. #####

Radiation detectors, radiation sensors, electron tube devices, or ionization chambers, herein referred to as “radiation detectors,” that contain only Division 2.2 gases, are excepted from the specification packaging in this subchapter and, except when transported by air, from labeling and placarding requirements of this subchapter when designed, packaged, and transported as follows:

(a) Radiation detectors must be single-trip, hermetically sealed, welded metal inside containers that will not fragment upon impact.

(b) Radiation detectors must not have a design pressure exceeding 4.83 MPa (700 psig) and a capacity exceeding 355 fluid ounces (641 cubic inches). They must be designed and fabricated with a burst pressure of not less than three times the design pressure if the radiation detector is equipped with a pressure relief device, and not less than four times the design pressure if the detector is not equipped with a pressure relief device.

(c) Radiation detectors must be shipped in a strong outer packaging capable of withstanding a drop test of at least 1.2 meters (4 feet) without breakage of the radiation detector or rupture of the outer packaging. If the radiation detector is shipped as part of other equipment, the equipment must be packaged in strong outer packaging or the equipment itself must provide an equivalent level of protection.

(d) Emergency response information accompanying each shipment and available from each emergency response telephone number for radiation detectors must identify those receptacles that are not fitted with a pressure relief device and provide appropriate guidance for exposure to fire.
