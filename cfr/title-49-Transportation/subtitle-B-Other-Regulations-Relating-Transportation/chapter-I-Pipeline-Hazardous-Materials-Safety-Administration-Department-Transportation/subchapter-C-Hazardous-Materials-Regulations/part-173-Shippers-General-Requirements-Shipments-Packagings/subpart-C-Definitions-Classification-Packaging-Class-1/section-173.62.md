(c) Explosives must be packaged in accordance with the following table:

(1) The first column lists, in alphanumeric sequence, the packing methods prescribed for explosives in the Explosives Table of paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) The second column specifies the inner packagings that are required. If inner packagings are not required, a notation of “Not necessary” appears in the column. The term “Not necessary” means that a suitable inner packaging may be used but is not required.

(3) The third column specifies the intermediate packagings that are required. If intermediate packagings are not required, a notation of “Not necessary” appears in the column. The term “Not necessary” means that a suitable intermediate packaging may be used but is not required.

(4) The fourth column specifies the outer packagings which are required. If inner packagings and/or intermediate packagings are specified in the second and third columns, then the packaging specified in the fourth column must be used as the outer packaging of a combination packaging; otherwise it may be used as a single packaging.

(5) Packing Instruction 101 may be used for any explosive substance or article if an equivalent level of safety is shown to be maintained subject to the approval of the Associate Administrator.

For UN Nos. 0077, 0132, 0234, 0235 and 0236, packagings must be lead free  <br/>2. For UN0160 and UN0161, when metal drums (1A2, 1B2 or 1N2) are used as the outer packaging, metal packagings must be so constructed that the risk of explosion, by reason of increased internal pressure from internal or external causes, is prevented.  <br/>3. For UN0160, UN0161, and UN0508, inner packagings are not necessary if drums are used as the outer packaging  <br/>4. For UN0508 and UN0509, metal packagings must not be used. Packagings of other material with a small amount of metal, for example metal closures or other metal fittings such as those mentioned in part 178 of this subchapter, are not considered metal packagings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                         paper, kraft, plastics, textile, sift-proof, woven plastics, sift-proof, Receptacles, fiberboard, metal, paper, plastics, wood, plastics, sift-proof                                                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                 natural wood, ordinary (4C1). natural wood, sift-proof walls (4C2). plywood (4D). reconstituted wood (4F).<br/>fiberboard (4G).

For liquid explosives, inner packagings must be surrounded with non-combustible absorbent cushioning material in sufficient quantity to absorb the entire liquid content. Metal receptacles should be cushioned from each other. The net mass of explosive per package may not exceed 30 kg when boxes are used as outer packaging. The net volume of explosive in each package other than boxes must not exceed 120 liters  <br/>2. For UN 0075, 0143, 0495 and 0497 when boxes are used as the outer packaging, inner packagings must have taped screw cap closures and be not more than 5 liters capacity each. A composite packaging consisting of a plastic receptacle in a metal drum (6HA1) may be used in lieu of combination packagings.

This packing instruction may only be used for explosives of UN 0082 when they are mixtures of ammonium nitrate or other inorganic nitrates with other combustible substances that are not explosive ingredients. Such explosives must not contain nitroglycerin, similar liquid organic nitrates, liquid or solid nitrocarbons, or chlorates.  <br/>2. This packing instruction may only be used for explosives of UN 0241 that consist of water as an essential ingredient and high proportions of ammonium nitrate or other oxidizers, some or all of which are in solution. The other constituents may include hydrocarbons or aluminum powder, but must not include nitro-derivatives such as trinitrotoluene.  <br/>3. Metal IBCs must not be used for UN 0082, UN 0222 and UN 0241.  <br/>4. Flexible IBCs may only be used for solids.  <br/>5. For UN 0222, when other than metal or rigid plastics IBCs are used, they must be offered for transportation in a closed freight container or a closed transport vehicle.  <br/>6. For UN 0222, flexible IBCs must be sift-proof and water-resistant or must be fitted with a sift-proof and water-resistant liner.                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                    metal (11A), (11B), (11N), (21A), (21B), (21N), (31A), (31B), (31N).  <br/>flexible (13H2), (13H3), (13H4), (13L2), (13L3), (13L4), (13M2).  <br/>rigid plastics (11H1), (11H2), (21H1), (21H2), (31H1), (31H2).  <br/>composite (11HZ1), (11HZ2), (21HZ1), (21HZ2), (31HZ1), (31HZ2).                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Large and robust explosives articles, normally intended for military use, without their means of initiation or with their means of initiation containing at least two effective protective features, may be carried unpackaged. When such articles have propelling charges or are self-propelled, their ignition systems must be protected against stimuli encountered during normal conditions of transport. A negative result in Test Series 4 on an unpackaged article indicates that the article can be considered for transport unpackaged. Such unpackaged articles may be fixed to cradles or contained in crates or other suitable handling devices  <br/>2.

For UN 0029, 0267 and 0455, bags and reels may not be used as inner packagings.  <br/>2. For UN 0030, 0255 and 0456, inner packagings are not required when detonators are packed in pasteboard tubes, or when their leg wires are wound on spools with the caps either placed inside the spool or securely taped to the wire on the spool, so as to restrict free moving of the caps and to protect them from impact forces.  <br/>3. For UN 0360, 0361 and 0500, detonators are not required to be attached to the safety fuse, metal-clad mild detonating cord, detonating cord, or shock tube. Inner packagings are not required if the packing configuration restricts free moving of the caps and protects them from impact forces.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                              paper  <br/>plastics  <br/>Receptacles  <br/>fiberboard  <br/>metal  <br/>plastics  <br/>wood  <br/>Reels                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                   steel (4A).  <br/>aluminum (4B).  <br/>other metal (4N).  <br/>wood, natural, ordinary (4C1).  <br/>natural wood, sift proof walls (4C2).  <br/>plastics, solid (4H2).  <br/>plywood (4D).  <br/>reconstituted wood (4F).  <br/>fiberboard (4G).  <br/>Drums.  <br/>steel (1A1 or 1A2).  <br/>Aluminum (1B1 or 1B2).  <br/>other metal (1N1 or 1N2).  <br/>Plywood (1D).  <br/>fiber (1G).  <br/>plastics (1H1 or 1H2).                                                                                                                                    |
