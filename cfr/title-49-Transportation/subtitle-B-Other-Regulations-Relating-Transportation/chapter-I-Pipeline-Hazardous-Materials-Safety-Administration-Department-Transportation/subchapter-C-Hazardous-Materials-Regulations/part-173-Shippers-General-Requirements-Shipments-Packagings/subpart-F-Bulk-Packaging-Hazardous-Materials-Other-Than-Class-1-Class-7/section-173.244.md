Note 1 to table 1 to paragraph (a)(2): Each tank car must have a reclosing pressure relief device having a start-to-discharge pressure of 10.34 Bar (150 psig). Restenciling to a lower test pressure is not authorized.

Note 2 to table 1 to paragraph (a)(2): Each tank car must have a reclosing pressure relief device having a start-to-discharge pressure of 15.51 Bar (225 psig). Restenciling to a lower test pressure is not authorized.

(3) As an alternative to the authorized tank car specification listed in the table in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a car of the same authorized tank car specification but of the next lower test pressure, as prescribed in column 5 of the table at § 179.101-1 of this subchapter, may be used provided that both of the following conditions are met:

(i) The difference between the alternative and the required minimum plate thicknesses, based on the calculation prescribed in § 179.100-6 of this subchapter, must be added to the alternative tank car jacket and head shield. When the jacket and head shield are made from steel with a minimum tensile strength from 70,000 p.s.i. to 80,000 p.s.i., but the required minimum plate thickness calculation is based on steel with a minimum tensile strength of 81,000 p.s.i., the thickness to be added to the jacket and head shield must be increased by a factor of 1.157. Forming allowances for heads are not required to be considered when calculating thickness differences.

(ii) The tank car jacket and head shield are manufactured from carbon steel plate as prescribed in § 179.100-7(a) of this subchapter.

(b) *Cargo tanks:* Specifications MC 330 and MC 331 cargo tank motor vehicles and, except for Division 4.2 materials, MC 312 and DOT 412 cargo tank motor vehicles.

(c) *Portable tanks:* DOT 51 portable tanks and UN portable tanks that meet the requirements of this subchapter, when a T code is specified in Column (7) of the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter for the specific hazardous material, are authorized. Additionally, a DOT 51 or UN portable tank used for Division 6.1 liquids, Hazard Zone A or B, must be certified and stamped to the ASME Code as specified in § 178.273(b)(6) of this subchapter.
