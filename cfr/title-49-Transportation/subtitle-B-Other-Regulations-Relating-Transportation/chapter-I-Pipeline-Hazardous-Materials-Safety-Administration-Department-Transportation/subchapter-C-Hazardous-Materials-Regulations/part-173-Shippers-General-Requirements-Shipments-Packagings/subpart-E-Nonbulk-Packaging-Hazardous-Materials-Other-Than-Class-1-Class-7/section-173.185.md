Lithium cells and batteries are subject to these tests regardless of whether the cells used to construct the battery are of a tested type.

(i) Cells and batteries manufactured according to a type meeting the requirements of sub-section 38.3 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Revision 3, Amendment 1 or any subsequent revision and amendment applicable at the date of the type testing may continue to be transported, unless otherwise provided in this subchapter.

(ii) Cell and battery types only meeting the requirements of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Revision 3, are no longer valid. However, cells and batteries manufactured in conformity with such types before July 2003 may continue to be transported if all other applicable requirements are fulfilled.

(2) Each person who manufactures lithium cells or batteries must create a record of satisfactory completion of the testing required by this paragraph prior to offering the lithium cell or battery for transport and must:

(i) Maintain this record for as long as that design is offered for transportation and for one year thereafter; and

(ii) Make this record available to an authorized representative of the Federal, state or local government upon request.

(3) Except for cells or batteries meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, each lithium cell or battery must:
