##### § 173.185 Lithium cells and batteries. #####

As used in this section, *lithium cell(s)* or *battery(ies)* includes both lithium metal and lithium ion chemistries. *Equipment* means the device or apparatus for which the lithium cells or batteries will provide electrical power for its operation.

(a) *Classification.* (1) Each lithium cell or battery must be of the type proven to meet the criteria in part III, sub-section 38.3 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Lithium cells and batteries are subject to these tests regardless of whether the cells used to construct the battery are of a tested type.

(i) Cells and batteries manufactured according to a type meeting the requirements of sub-section 38.3 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Revision 3, Amendment 1 or any subsequent revision and amendment applicable at the date of the type testing may continue to be transported, unless otherwise provided in this subchapter.

(ii) Cell and battery types only meeting the requirements of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Revision 3, are no longer valid. However, cells and batteries manufactured in conformity with such types before July 2003 may continue to be transported if all other applicable requirements are fulfilled.

(2) Each person who manufactures lithium cells or batteries must create a record of satisfactory completion of the testing required by this paragraph prior to offering the lithium cell or battery for transport and must:

(i) Maintain this record for as long as that design is offered for transportation and for one year thereafter; and

(ii) Make this record available to an authorized representative of the Federal, state or local government upon request.

(3) Except for cells or batteries meeting the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, each lithium cell or battery must:

(i) Incorporate a safety venting device or be designed to preclude a violent rupture under conditions normally incident to transport;

(ii) Be equipped with means of preventing external short circuits; and

(iii) Be equipped with an means of preventing dangerous reverse current flow (*e.g.,* diodes or fuses) if a battery contains cells, or a series of cells that are connected in parallel.

(b) *Packaging.* (1) Each package offered for transportation containing lithium cells or batteries, including lithium cells or batteries packed with, or contained in, equipment, must meet all applicable requirements of subpart B of this part.

(2) Lithium cells or batteries, including lithium cells or batteries packed with, or contained in, equipment, must be packaged in a manner to prevent:

(i) Short circuits;

(ii) Movement within the outer package; and

(iii) Accidental activation of the equipment.

(3) For packages containing lithium cells or batteries offered for transportation:

(i) The lithium cells or batteries must be placed in non-metallic inner packagings that completely enclose the cells or batteries, and separate the cells or batteries from contact with equipment, other devices, or conductive materials (*e.g.,* metal) in the packaging.

(ii) The inner packagings containing lithium cells or batteries must be placed in one of the following packagings meeting the requirements of part 178, subparts L and M, of this subchapter at the Packing Group II level:

(C) Metal (3A2, 3B2) or plastic (3H2) jerrican.

(iii) When packed with equipment, lithium cells or batteries must:

(A) Be placed in inner packagings that completely enclose the cell or battery, then placed in an outer packaging. The completed package for the cells or batteries must meet the Packing Group II performance requirements as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section; or

(B) Be placed in inner packagings that completely enclose the cell or battery, then placed with equipment in a package that meets the Packing Group II performance requirements as specified in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.

(4) When lithium cells or batteries are contained in equipment:

(i) The outer packaging, when used, must be constructed of suitable material of adequate strength and design in relation to the capacity and intended use of the packaging, unless the lithium cells or batteries are afforded equivalent protection by the equipment in which they are contained;

(ii) Equipment must be secured against movement within the outer packaging and be packed so as to prevent accidental operation during transport; and

(iii) Any spare lithium cells or batteries packed with the equipment must be packaged in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(5) Lithium batteries that weigh 12 kg (26.5 pounds) or more and have a strong, impact-resistant outer casing and assemblies of such batteries, may be packed in strong outer packagings; in protective enclosures (for example, in fully enclosed or wooden slatted crates); or on pallets or other handling devices, instead of packages meeting the UN performance packaging requirements in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii) and (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Batteries or battery assemblies must be secured to prevent inadvertent movement, and the terminals may not support the weight of other superimposed elements. Batteries or battery assemblies packaged in accordance with this paragraph are not permitted for transportation by passenger-carrying aircraft, and may be transported by cargo aircraft only if approved by the Associate Administrator.
