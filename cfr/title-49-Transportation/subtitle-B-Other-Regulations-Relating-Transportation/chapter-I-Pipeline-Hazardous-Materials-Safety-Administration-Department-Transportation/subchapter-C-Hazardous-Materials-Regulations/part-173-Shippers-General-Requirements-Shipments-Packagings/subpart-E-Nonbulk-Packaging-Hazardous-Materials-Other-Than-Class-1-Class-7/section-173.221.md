##### ยง 173.221 Polymeric beads, expandable and Plastic molding compound. #####

(a) Non-bulk shipments of Polymeric beads (or granules), expandable *evolving flammable vapor* and Plastic molding compound *in dough, sheet or extruded rope form, evolving flammable vapor* must be packed in: metal (4A, 4B, or 4N), wooden (4C1 or 4C2), plywood (4D), fiberboard (4G), reconstituted wood (4F), plastic (4H1 or 4H2) boxes, plywood drums (1D) or fiber drums (1G) with sealed inner plastic liners; in vapor tight metal or plastic drums (1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 1B2, 1N1, 1N2, 1H1 or 1H2); in vapor tight metal or plastic jerricans (3A1, 3A2, 3B1, 3B2, 3H1, or 3H2); or packed in non-specification packagings when transported in dedicated vehicles or freight containers. The packagings need not conform to the requirements for package testing in part 178 of this subchapter, but must be capable of containing any evolving gases from the contents during normal conditions of transportation.

(b) Bulk shipments of Polymeric beads (or granules), expandable, *evolving flammable vapor* or Plastic molding compounds *in dough, sheet or extruded rope, evolving flammable vapor* may be packed in non-specification bulk packagings. Except for transportation by highway and rail, bulk packagings must be capable of containing any gases evolving from the contents during normal conditions of transportation.

(c) For transportation by vessel, the provisions of ยง 176.907 must be met.

(d) *Exceptions.* When it can be demonstrated that no flammable vapor, resulting in a flammable atmosphere, is evolved according to test U1 (Test method for substances liable to evolve flammable vapors) of Part III, sub-section 38.4.4 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see ยง 171.7 of this subchapter), polymeric beads, expandable need not be classed as Class 9 (UN2211). This test should only be performed when de-classification of a substance is considered.
