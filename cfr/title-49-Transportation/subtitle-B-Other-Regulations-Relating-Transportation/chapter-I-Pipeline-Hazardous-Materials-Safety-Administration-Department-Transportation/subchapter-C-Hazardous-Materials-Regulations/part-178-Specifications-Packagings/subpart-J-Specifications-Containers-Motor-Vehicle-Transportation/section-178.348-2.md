##### § 178.348-2 Material and thickness of material. #####

(a) The type and thickness of material for DOT 412 specification cargo tanks must conform to § 178.345-2, but in no case may the thickness be less than that determined by the minimum thickness requirements in § 178.320(a). The following Tables I and II identify the “Specified Minimum Thickness” values to be employed in that determination.
