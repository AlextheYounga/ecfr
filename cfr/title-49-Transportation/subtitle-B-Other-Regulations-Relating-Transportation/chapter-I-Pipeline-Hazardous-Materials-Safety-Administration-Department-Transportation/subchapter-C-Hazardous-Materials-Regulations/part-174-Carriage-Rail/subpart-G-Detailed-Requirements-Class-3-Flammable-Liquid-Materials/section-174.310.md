##### § 174.310 Requirements for the operation of high-hazard flammable trains. #####

(a) *Applicability.* Each rail carrier operating a high-hazard flammable train (as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter) must comply with each of the following additional safety requirements with respect to each high-hazard flammable train that it operates:

(1) *Routing.* The additional planning requirements for transportation by rail in accordance with part 172, subpart I of this subchapter;

(2) *Speed restrictions.* All trains are limited to a maximum speed of 50 mph. The train is further limited to a maximum speed of 40 mph while that train travels within the limits of high-threat urban areas (HTUAs) as defined in § 1580.3 of this title, unless all tank cars containing a Class 3 flammable liquid meet or exceed the DOT Specification 117 standards, the DOT Specification 117P performance standards, or the DOT Specification 117R retrofit standards provided in part 179, subpart D of this subchapter.

(3) *Braking.* (i) Each rail carrier operating a high-hazard flammable train (as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter) operating at a speed in excess of 30 mph must ensure the train is equipped and operated with either a two-way end-of-train (EOT) device, as defined in 49 CFR 232.5, or a distributed power (DP) system, as defined in 49 CFR 229.5.

(ii) By January 1, 2021, each rail carrier operating a high-hazard flammable unit train (HHFUT) comprised of at least one tank car loaded with a Packing Group I material, at a speed exceeding 30 mph must ensure the train is equipped with ECP brakes that meet the requirements of 49 CFR part 232, subpart G, except for buffer cars, and must be operated in ECP brake mode as established in 49 CFR part 232, subpart G.

(iii) By May 1, 2023, each rail carrier operating a high-hazard flammable unit train (HHFUT) not described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section, at a speed exceeding 30 mph must ensure the train is equipped with ECP brakes that meet the requirements of 49 CFR part 232, subpart G, except for buffer cars, and must be operated in ECP brake mode as established in 49 CFR part 232, subpart G.

(iv) Each buffer car in an high-hazard flammable unit train that is not equipped with ECP brakes will be counted in determining the percentage of cars with effective and operative brakes during the operation of the train, as required under 49 CFR 232.609.

(v) Alternate brake systems may be submitted for approval through the processes and procedures outlined in 49 CFR part 232, subpart F.

(4) *New tank cars.* After October 1, 2015, tank cars manufactured for use in a HHFT must meet:

(i) DOT Specification 117, or 117P performance standard in part 179, subpart D of this subchapter; or

(ii) An authorized tank specification as specified in part 173, subpart F of this subchapter.

(5) *Retrofit reporting* Owners of non-jacketed DOT-111 tank cars in PG I service in an HHFT, who are unable to meet the January 1, 2017, retrofit deadline specified in § 173.243 (a)(1) are required to submit a report by March 1, 2017, to Department of Transportation. A group representing owners may submit a consolidated report to the Department of Transportation in lieu of individual reports from each tank car owner. The report must include the following information regarding the retrofitting progress:

(i) The total number of tank cars retrofitted to meet the DOT-117R specification;

(ii) The total number of tank cars built or retrofitted to meet the DOT-117P specification;

(iii) The total number of DOT-111 tank cars (including those built to CPC-1232 industry standard) that have not been modified;

(iv) The total number of tank cars built to meet the DOT-117 specification; and

(v) The total number of tank cars built or retrofitted to a DOT-117, 117R or 117P specification that are ECP brake ready or ECP brake equipped.

(vi) Entities required to submit a report under this paragraph shall submit subsequent follow-up reports containing the information identified in this paragraph within 60 days of being notified by PHMSA and FRA.

(b) [Reserved]
