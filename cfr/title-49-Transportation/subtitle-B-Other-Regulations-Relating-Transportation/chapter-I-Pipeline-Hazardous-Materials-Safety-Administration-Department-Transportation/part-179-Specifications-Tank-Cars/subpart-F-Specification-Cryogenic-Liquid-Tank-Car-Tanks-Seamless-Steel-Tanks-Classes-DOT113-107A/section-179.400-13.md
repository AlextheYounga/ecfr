##### § 179.400-13 Support system for inner tank. #####

(a) The inner tank must be supported within the outer jacket by a support system of approved design. The system and its areas of attachment to the outer jacket must have adequate strength and ductility at operating temperatures to support the inner tank when filled with the lading to any level incident to transportation.

(b) The support system must be designed to support, without yielding, impact loads producing accelerations of the following magnitudes and directions when the inner tank is fully loaded and the car is equipped with a conventional draft gear:

Longitudinal7“g”Transverse3“g”Vertical3“g”The longitudinal acceleration may be reduced to 3“g” where a cushioning device of approved design, which has been tested to demonstrate its ability to limit body forces to 400,000 pounds maximum at 10 miles per hour, is used between the coupler and the tank structure.

(c) The inner tank and outer jacket must be permanently bonded to each other electrically, by either the support system, piping, or a separate electrical connection of approved design.
