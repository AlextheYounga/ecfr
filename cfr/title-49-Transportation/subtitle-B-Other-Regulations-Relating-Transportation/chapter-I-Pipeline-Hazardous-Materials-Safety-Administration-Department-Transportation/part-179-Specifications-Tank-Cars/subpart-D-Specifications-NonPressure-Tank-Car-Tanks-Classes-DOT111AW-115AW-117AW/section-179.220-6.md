##### § 179.220-6 Thickness of plates. #####

(a) The wall thickness, after forming of the inner container shell and 2:1 ellipsoidal heads must be not less than specified in § 179.221-1, or not less than that calculated by the following formula:

(b) The wall thickness after forming of the inner container heads, if flanged and dished, must be not less than specified in § 179.221-1, or not less than that calculated by the following formula:

(c) The wall thickness after forming of the cylindrical section and heads of the outer shell must be not less than seven-sixteenths of an inch.

(d) See § 179.220-9 for plate thickness requirements for inner container when divided into compartments.
