The repair work must be performed under the supervision of an independent inspection agency. Upon completion of the re-threading, the threads must be gauged in accordance with Federal Standard H-28 or an equivalent standard containing the same specification limits. The re-threaded cylinder must be stamped clearly and legibly with the words “RETHREAD” on the shoulder, top head, or neck.
