##### ยง 195.583 What must I do to monitor atmospheric corrosion control? #####

(a) You must inspect each pipeline or portion of pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion, as follows:

|If the pipeline is  <br/>located:|                      Then the frequency of inspection is:                       |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|             Onshore             |At least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.|
|            Offshore             |  At least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months.  |

(b) During inspections you must give particular attention to pipe at soil-to-air interfaces, under thermal insulation, under disbonded coatings, at pipe supports, in splash zones, at deck penetrations, and in spans over water.

(c) If you find atmospheric corrosion during an inspection, you must provide protection against the corrosion as required by ยง 195.581.
