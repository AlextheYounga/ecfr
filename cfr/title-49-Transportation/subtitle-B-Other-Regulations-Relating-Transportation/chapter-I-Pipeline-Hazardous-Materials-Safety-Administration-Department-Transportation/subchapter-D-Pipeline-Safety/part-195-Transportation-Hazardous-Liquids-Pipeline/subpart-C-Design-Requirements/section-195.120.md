##### ยง 195.120 Passage of internal inspection devices. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each new pipeline and each line section of a pipeline where the line pipe, valve, fitting or other line component is replaced; must be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

(b) This section does not apply to:

(1) Manifolds;

(2) Station piping such as at pump stations, meter stations, or pressure reducing stations;

(3) Piping associated with tank farms and other storage facilities;

(4) Cross-overs;

(5) Sizes of pipe for which an instrumented internal inspection device is not commercially available;

(6) Offshore pipelines, other than main lines 10 inches (254 millimeters) or greater in nominal diameter, that transport liquids to onshore facilities; and

(7) Other piping that the Administrator under ยง 190.9 of this chapter, finds in a particular case would be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

(c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time constraints and other unforeseen construction problems need not construct a new or replacement segment of a pipeline to meet paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator determines and documents why an impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Within 30 days after discovering the emergency or construction problem the operator must petition, under ยง 190.9 of this chapter, for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial, the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.
