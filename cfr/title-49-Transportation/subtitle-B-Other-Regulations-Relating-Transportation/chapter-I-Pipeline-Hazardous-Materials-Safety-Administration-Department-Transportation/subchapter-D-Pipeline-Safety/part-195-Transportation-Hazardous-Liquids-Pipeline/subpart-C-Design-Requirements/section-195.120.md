##### § 195.120 Passage of In-Line Inspection tools. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 52294, Oct. 1, 2019.

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, each new pipeline and each replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a pipeline must be designed and constructed to accommodate the passage of an In-Line Inspection tool, in accordance with NACE SP0102-2010, Section 7 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 195.3).

(b) This section does not apply to:

(1) Manifolds;

(2) Station piping such as at pump stations, meter stations, or pressure reducing stations;

(3) Piping associated with tank farms and other storage facilities;

(4) Cross-overs;

(5) Sizes of pipe for which an instrumented internal inspection device is not commercially available;

(6) Offshore pipelines, other than main lines 10 inches (254 millimeters) or greater in nominal diameter, that transport liquids to onshore facilities; and

(7) Other piping that the Administrator under § 190.9 of this chapter, finds in a particular case would be impracticable to design and construct to accommodate the passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.

(c) An operator encountering emergencies, construction time constraints and other unforeseen construction problems need not construct a new or replacement segment of a pipeline to meet paragraph (a) of this section, if the operator determines and documents why an impracticability prohibits compliance with paragraph (a) of this section. Within 30 days after discovering the emergency or construction problem the operator must petition, under § 190.9 of this chapter, for approval that design and construction to accommodate passage of instrumented internal inspection devices would be impracticable. If the petition is denied, within 1 year after the date of the notice of the denial, the operator must modify that segment to allow passage of instrumented internal inspection devices.
