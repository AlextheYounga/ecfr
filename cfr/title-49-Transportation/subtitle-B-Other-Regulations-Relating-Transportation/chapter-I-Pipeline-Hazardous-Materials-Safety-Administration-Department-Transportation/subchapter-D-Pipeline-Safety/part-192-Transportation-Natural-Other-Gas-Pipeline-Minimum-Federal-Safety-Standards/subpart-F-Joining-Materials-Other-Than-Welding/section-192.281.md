##### ยง 192.281 Plastic pipe. #####

(a) *General.* A plastic pipe joint that is joined by solvent cement, adhesive, or heat fusion may not be disturbed until it has properly set. Plastic pipe may not be joined by a threaded joint or miter joint.

(b) *Solvent cement joints.* Each solvent cement joint on plastic pipe must comply with the following:

(1) The mating surfaces of the joint must be clean, dry, and free of material which might be detrimental to the joint.

(2) The solvent cement must conform to ASTM D2513-99, (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 192.7).

(3) The joint may not be heated to accelerate the setting of the cement.

(c) *Heat-fusion joints.* Each heat-fusion joint on plastic pipe must comply with the following:

(1) A butt heat-fusion joint must be joined by a device that holds the heater element square to the ends of the piping, compresses the heated ends together, and holds the pipe in proper alignment while the plastic hardens.

(2) A socket heat-fusion joint must be joined by a device that heats the mating surfaces of the joint uniformly and simultaneously to essentially the same temperature.

(3) An electrofusion joint must be joined utilizing the equipment and techniques of the fittings manufacturer or equipment and techniques shown, by testing joints to the requirements of ยง 192.283(a)(1)(iii), to be at least equivalent to those of the fittings manufacturer.

(4) Heat may not be applied with a torch or other open flame.

(d) *Adhesive joints.* Each adhesive joint on plastic pipe must comply with the following:

(1) The adhesive must conform to ASTM D 2517 (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 192.7).

(2) The materials and adhesive must be compatible with each other.

(e) *Mechanical joints.* Each compression type mechanical joint on plastic pipe must comply with the following:

(1) The gasket material in the coupling must be compatible with the plastic.

(2) A rigid internal tubular stiffener, other than a split tubular stiffener, must be used in conjunction with the coupling.
