##### § 192.283 Plastic pipe: Qualifying joining procedures. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 58718, Nov. 20, 2018.

(a) *Heat fusion, solvent cement, and adhesive joints.* Before any written procedure established under § 192.273(b) is used for making plastic pipe joints by a heat fusion, solvent cement, or adhesive method, the procedure must be qualified by subjecting specimen joints made according to the procedure to the following tests:

(1) The burst test requirements of -

(i) In the case of thermoplastic pipe, paragraph 6.6 (Sustained Pressure Test) or paragraph 6.7 (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Test) of ASTM D2513-99 for plastic materials other than polyethylene or ASTM D2513-09a (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7) for polyethylene plastic materials;

(ii) In the case of thermosetting plastic pipe, paragraph 8.5 (Minimum Hydrostatic Burst Pressure) or paragraph 8.9 (Sustained Static Pressure Test) of ASTM D2517 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7); or

(iii) In the case of electrofusion fittings for polyethylene (PE) pipe and tubing, paragraph 9.1 (Minimum Hydraulic Burst Pressure Test), paragraph 9.2 (Sustained Pressure Test), paragraph 9.3 (Tensile Strength Test), or paragraph 9.4 (Joint Integrity Tests) of ASTM F1055 (incorporated by reference, see § 192.7).

(2) For procedures intended for lateral pipe connections, subject a specimen joint made from pipe sections joined at right angles according to the procedure to a force on the lateral pipe until failure occurs in the specimen. If failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure qualifies for use; and

(3) For procedures intended for non-lateral pipe connections, follow the tensile test requirements of ASTM D638 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7), except that the test may be conducted at ambient temperature and humidity If the specimen elongates no less than 25 percent or failure initiates outside the joint area, the procedure qualifies for use.

(b) *Mechanical joints.* Before any written procedure established under § 192.273(b) is used for making mechanical plastic pipe joints that are designed to withstand tensile forces, the procedure must be qualified by subjecting 5 specimen joints made according to the procedure to the following tensile test:

(1) Use an apparatus for the test as specified in ASTM D 638 (except for conditioning), (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7).

(2) The specimen must be of such length that the distance between the grips of the apparatus and the end of the stiffener does not affect the joint strength.

(3) The speed of testing is 0.20 in (5.0 mm) per minute, plus or minus 25 percent.

(4) Pipe specimens less than 4 inches (102 mm) in diameter are qualified if the pipe yields to an elongation of no less than 25 percent or failure initiates outside the joint area.

(5) Pipe specimens 4 inches (102 mm) and larger in diameter shall be pulled until the pipe is subjected to a tensile stress equal to or greater than the maximum thermal stress that would be produced by a temperature change of 100 °F (38 °C) or until the pipe is pulled from the fitting. If the pipe pulls from the fitting, the lowest value of the five test results or the manufacturer's rating, whichever is lower must be used in the design calculations for stress.

(6) Each specimen that fails at the grips must be retested using new pipe.

(7) Results obtained pertain only to the specific outside diameter, and material of the pipe tested, except that testing of a heavier wall pipe may be used to qualify pipe of the same material but with a lesser wall thickness.

(c) A copy of each written procedure being used for joining plastic pipe must be available to the persons making and inspecting joints.

(d) Pipe or fittings manufactured before July 1, 1980, may be used in accordance with procedures that the manufacturer certifies will produce a joint as strong as the pipe.
