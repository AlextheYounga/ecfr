##### § 192.143 General requirements. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 58717, Nov. 20, 2018.

(a) Each component of a pipeline must be able to withstand operating pressures and other anticipated loadings without impairment of its serviceability with unit stresses equivalent to those allowed for comparable material in pipe in the same location and kind of service. However, if design based upon unit stresses is impractical for a particular component, design may be based upon a pressure rating established by the manufacturer by pressure testing that component or a prototype of the component.

(b) The design and installation of pipeline components and facilities must meet applicable requirements for corrosion control found in subpart I of this part.
