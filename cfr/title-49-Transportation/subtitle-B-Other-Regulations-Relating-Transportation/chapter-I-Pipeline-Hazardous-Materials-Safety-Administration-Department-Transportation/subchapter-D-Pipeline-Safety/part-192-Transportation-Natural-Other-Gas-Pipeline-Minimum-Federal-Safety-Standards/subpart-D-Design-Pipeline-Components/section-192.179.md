##### ยง 192.179 Transmission line valves. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 20982, Apr. 8, 2022.

(a) Each transmission line, other than offshore segments, must have sectionalizing block valves spaced as follows, unless in a particular case the Administrator finds that alternative spacing would provide an equivalent level of safety:

(1) Each point on the pipeline in a Class 4 location must be within 21/2 miles (4 kilometers)of a valve.

(2) Each point on the pipeline in a Class 3 location must be within 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) of a valve.

(3) Each point on the pipeline in a Class 2 location must be within 71/2 miles (12 kilometers) of a valve.

(4) Each point on the pipeline in a Class 1 location must be within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of a valve.

(b) Each sectionalizing block valve on a transmission line, other than offshore segments, must comply with the following:

(1) The valve and the operating device to open or close the valve must be readily accessible and protected from tampering and damage.

(2) The valve must be supported to prevent settling of the valve or movement of the pipe to which it is attached.

(c) Each section of a transmission line, other than offshore segments, between main line valves must have a blowdown valve with enough capacity to allow the transmission line to be blown down as rapidly as practicable. Each blowdown discharge must be located so the gas can be blown to the atmosphere without hazard and, if the transmission line is adjacent to an overhead electric line, so that the gas is directed away from the electrical conductors.

(d) Offshore segments of transmission lines must be equipped with valves or other components to shut off the flow of gas to an offshore platform in an emergency.
