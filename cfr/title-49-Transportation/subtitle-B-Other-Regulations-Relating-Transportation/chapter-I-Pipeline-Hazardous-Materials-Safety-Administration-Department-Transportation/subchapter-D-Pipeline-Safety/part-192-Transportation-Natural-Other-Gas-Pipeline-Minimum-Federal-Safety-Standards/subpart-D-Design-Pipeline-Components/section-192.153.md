Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 2239, Jan. 11, 2021.

(a) Except for branch connections and assemblies of standard pipe and fittings joined by circumferential welds, the design pressure of each component fabricated by welding, whose strength cannot be determined, must be established in accordance with paragraph UG-101 of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) (Section VIII, Division 1) (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 192.7).

(b) Each prefabricated unit that uses plate and longitudinal seams must be designed, constructed, and tested in accordance with section 1 of the ASME BPVC (Section VIII, Division 1 or Section VIII, Division 2) (incorporated by reference, *see* ยง 192.7), except for the following:

(1) Regularly manufactured butt-welding fittings.

(2) Pipe that has been produced and tested under a specification listed in appendix B to this part.

(3) Partial assemblies such as split rings or collars.

(4) Prefabricated units that the manufacturer certifies have been tested to at least twice the maximum pressure to which they will be subjected under the anticipated operating conditions.

(c) Orange-peel bull plugs and orange-peel swages may not be used on pipelines that are to operate at a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of the SMYS of the pipe.

(d) Except for flat closures designed in accordance with the ASME BPVC (Section VIII, Division 1 or 2), flat closures and fish tails may not be used on pipe that either operates at 100 p.s.i. (689 kPa) gage or more, or is more than 3 inches in (76 millimeters) nominal diameter.

(e) A component having a design pressure established in accordance with paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of this section and subject to the strength testing requirements of ยง 192.505(b) must be tested to at least 1.5 times the MAOP.
