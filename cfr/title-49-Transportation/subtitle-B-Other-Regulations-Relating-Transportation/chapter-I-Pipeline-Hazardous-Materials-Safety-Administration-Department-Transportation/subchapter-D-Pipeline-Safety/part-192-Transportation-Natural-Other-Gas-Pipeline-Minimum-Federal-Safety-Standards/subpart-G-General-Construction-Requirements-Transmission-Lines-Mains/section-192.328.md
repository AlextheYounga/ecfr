##### § 192.328 Additional construction requirements for steel pipe using alternative maximum allowable operating pressure. #####

For a new or existing pipeline segment to be eligible for operation at the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure calculated under § 192.620, a segment must meet the following additional construction requirements. Records must be maintained, for the useful life of the pipeline, demonstrating compliance with these requirements:

|To address this construction issue:|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                The pipeline segment must meet this additional construction requirement:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|   (d) Initial strength testing    |(1) The pipeline segment must not have experienced failures indicative of systemic material defects during strength testing, including initial hydrostatic testing. A root cause analysis, including metallurgical examination of the failed pipe, must be performed for any failure experienced to verify that it is not indicative of a systemic concern. The results of this root cause analysis must be reported to each PHMSA pipeline safety regional office where the pipe is in service at least 60 days prior to operating at the alternative MAOP. An operator must also notify a State pipeline safety authority when the pipeline is located in a State where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate pipeline is regulated by that State.|
