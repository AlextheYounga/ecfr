*Gas* means natural gas, flammable gas, or gas which is toxic or corrosive.

*Gathering line* means a pipeline that transports gas from a current production facility to a transmission line or main.

*Gulf of Mexico and its inlets* means the waters from the mean high water mark of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets open to the sea (excluding rivers, tidal marshes, lakes, and canals) seaward to include the territorial sea and Outer Continental Shelf to a depth of 15 feet (4.6 meters), as measured from the mean low water.

*Hazard to navigation* means, for the purposes of this part, a pipeline where the top of the pipe is less than 12 inches (305 millimeters) below the underwater natural bottom (as determined by recognized and generally accepted practices) in waters less than 15 feet (4.6 meters) deep, as measured from the mean low water.

*High-pressure distribution system* means a distribution system in which the gas pressure in the main is higher than the pressure provided to the customer.

*Line section* means a continuous run of transmission line between adjacent compressor stations, between a compressor station and storage facilities, between a compressor station and a block valve, or between adjacent block valves.

*Listed specification* means a specification listed in section I of appendix B of this part.

*Low-pressure distribution system* means a distribution system in which the gas pressure in the main is substantially the same as the pressure provided to the customer.

*Main* means a distribution line that serves as a common source of supply for more than one service line.

*Maximum actual operating pressure* means the maximum pressure that occurs during normal operations over a period of 1 year.

*Maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP)* means the maximum pressure at which a pipeline or segment of a pipeline may be operated under this part.

*Municipality* means a city, county, or any other political subdivision of a State.

*Offshore* means beyond the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast of the United States that is in direct contact with the open seas and beyond the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters.

*Operator* means a person who engages in the transportation of gas.

*Outer Continental Shelf* means all submerged lands lying seaward and outside the area of lands beneath navigable waters as defined in Section 2 of the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301) and of which the subsoil and seabed appertain to the United States and are subject to its jurisdiction and control.

*Person* means any individual, firm, joint venture, partnership, corporation, association, State, municipality, cooperative association, or joint stock association, and including any trustee, receiver, assignee, or personal representative thereof.

*Petroleum gas* means propane, propylene, butane, (normal butane or isobutanes), and butylene (including isomers), or mixtures composed predominantly of these gases, having a vapor pressure not exceeding 208 psi (1434 kPa) gage at 100 °F (38 °C).

*Pipe* means any pipe or tubing used in the transportation of gas, including pipe-type holders.

*Pipeline* means all parts of those physical facilities through which gas moves in transportation, including pipe, valves, and other appurtenance attached to pipe, compressor units, metering stations, regulator stations, delivery stations, holders, and fabricated assemblies.

*Pipeline environment* includes soil resistivity (high or low), soil moisture (wet or dry), soil contaminants that may promote corrosive activity, and other known conditions that could affect the probability of active corrosion.

*Pipeline facility* means new and existing pipelines, rights-of-way, and any equipment, facility, or building used in the transportation of gas or in the treatment of gas during the course of transportation.

*Service line* means a distribution line that transports gas from a common source of supply to an individual customer, to two adjacent or adjoining residential or small commercial customers, or to multiple residential or small commercial customers served through a meter header or manifold. A service line ends at the outlet of the customer meter or at the connection to a customer's piping, whichever is further downstream, or at the connection to customer piping if there is no meter.

*Service regulator* means the device on a service line that controls the pressure of gas delivered from a higher pressure to the pressure provided to the customer. A service regulator may serve one customer or multiple customers through a meter header or manifold.

*SMYS* means specified minimum yield strength is:

(1) For steel pipe manufactured in accordance with a listed specification, the yield strength specified as a minimum in that specification; or

(2) For steel pipe manufactured in accordance with an unknown or unlisted specification, the yield strength determined in accordance with § 192.107(b).

*State* means each of the several States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

*Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system* means a computer-based system or systems used by a controller in a control room that collects and displays information about a pipeline facility and may have the ability to send commands back to the pipeline facility.

*Transmission line* means a pipeline, other than a gathering line, that: (1) Transports gas from a gathering line or storage facility to a distribution center, storage facility, or large volume customer that is not down-stream from a distribution center; (2) operates at a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of SMYS; or (3) transports gas within a storage field.

Note:

A large volume customer may receive similar volumes of gas as a distribution center, and includes factories, power plants, and institutional users of gas.

*Transportation of gas* means the gathering, transmission, or distribution of gas by pipeline or the storage of gas, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.

*Underground natural gas storage facility* means a facility that stores natural gas in an underground facility incident to natural gas transportation, including -

(1) A depleted hydrocarbon reservoir;

(2) An aquifer reservoir; or

(3) A solution-mined salt cavern reservoir, including associated material and equipment used for injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation wells, and wellhead equipment, piping, rights-of-way, property, buildings, compressor units, separators, metering equipment, and regulator equipment.

*Weak link* means a device or method used when pulling polyethylene pipe, typically through methods such as horizontal directional drilling, to ensure that damage will not occur to the pipeline by exceeding the maximum tensile stresses allowed.

*Welder* means a person who performs manual or semi-automatic welding.

*Welding operator* means a person who operates machine or automatic welding equipment.
