(a) Each segment of a plastic pipeline must be tested in accordance with this section.

(b) The test procedure must insure discovery of all potentially hazardous leaks in the segment being tested.

(c) The test pressure must be at least 150 percent of the maximum operating pressure or 50 p.s.i. (345 kPa) gage, whichever is greater. However, the maximum test pressure may not be more than three times the pressure determined under § 192.121, at a temperature not less than the pipe temperature during the test.

(d) During the test, the temperature of thermoplastic material may not be more than 100 °F (38 °C), or the temperature at which the material's long-term hydrostatic strength has been determined under the listed specification, whichever is greater.
