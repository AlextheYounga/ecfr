Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 2241, Jan. 11, 2021.Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 12834, Mar. 5, 2021, delaying the above amendment until Mar. 21, 2021.

Except for service lines and plastic pipelines, each segment of a pipeline that is to be operated at a hoop stress less than 30 percent of SMYS and at or above 100 p.s.i. (689 kPa) gage must be tested in accordance with the following:

(a) The pipeline operator must use a test procedure that will ensure discovery of all potentially hazardous leaks in the segment being tested.

(b) If, during the test, the segment is to be stressed to 20 percent or more of SMYS and natural gas, inert gas, or air is the test medium -

(1) A leak test must be made at a pressure between 100 p.s.i. (689 kPa) gage and the pressure required to produce a hoop stress of 20 percent of SMYS; or

(2) The line must be walked to check for leaks while the hoop stress is held at approximately 20 percent of SMYS.

(c) The pressure must be maintained at or above the test pressure for at least 1 hour.
