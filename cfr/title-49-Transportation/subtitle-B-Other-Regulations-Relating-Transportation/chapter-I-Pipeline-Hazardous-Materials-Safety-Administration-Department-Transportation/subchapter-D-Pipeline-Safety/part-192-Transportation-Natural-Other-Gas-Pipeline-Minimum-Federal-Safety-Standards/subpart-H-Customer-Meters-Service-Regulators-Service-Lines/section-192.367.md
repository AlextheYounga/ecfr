Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 58719, Nov. 20, 2018.

(a) *Location.* Each service line connection to a main must be located at the top of the main or, if that is not practical, at the side of the main, unless a suitable protective device is installed to minimize the possibility of dust and moisture being carried from the main into the service line.

(b) *Compression-type connection to main.* Each compression-type service line to main connection must:

(1) Be designed and installed to effectively sustain the longitudinal pull-out or thrust forces caused by contraction or expansion of the piping, or by anticipated external or internal loading; and

(2) If gaskets are used in connecting the service line to the main connection fitting, have gaskets that are compatible with the kind of gas in the system.
