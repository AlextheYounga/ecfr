##### ยง 192.452 How does this subpart apply to converted pipelines and regulated onshore gathering lines? #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 63298, Nov. 15, 2021.

(a) *Converted pipelines.* Notwithstanding the date the pipeline was installed or any earlier deadlines for compliance, each pipeline which qualifies for use under this part in accordance with ยง 192.14 must meet the requirements of this subpart specifically applicable to pipelines installed before August 1, 1971, and all other applicable requirements within 1 year after the pipeline is readied for service. However, the requirements of this subpart specifically applicable to pipelines installed after July 31, 1971, apply if the pipeline substantially meets those requirements before it is readied for service or it is a segment which is replaced, relocated, or substantially altered.

(b) *Regulated onshore gathering lines.* For any regulated onshore gathering line under ยง 192.9 existing on April 14, 2006, that was not previously subject to this part, and for any onshore gathering line that becomes a regulated onshore gathering line under ยง 192.9 after April 14, 2006, because of a change in class location or increase in dwelling density:

(1) The requirements of this subpart specifically applicable to pipelines installed before August 1, 1971, apply to the gathering line regardless of the date the pipeline was actually installed; and

(2) The requirements of this subpart specifically applicable to pipelines installed after July 31, 1971, apply only if the pipeline substantially meets those requirements.
