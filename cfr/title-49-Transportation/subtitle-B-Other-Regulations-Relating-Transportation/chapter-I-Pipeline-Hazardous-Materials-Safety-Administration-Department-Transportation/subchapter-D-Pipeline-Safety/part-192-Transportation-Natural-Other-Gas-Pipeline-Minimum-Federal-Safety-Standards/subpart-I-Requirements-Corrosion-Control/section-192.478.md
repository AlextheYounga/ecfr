##### ยง 192.478 Internal corrosion control: Onshore transmission monitoring and mitigation. #####

(a) Each operator of an onshore gas transmission pipeline with corrosive constituents in the gas being transported must develop and implement a monitoring and mitigation program to mitigate the corrosive effects, as necessary. Potentially corrosive constituents include, but are not limited to: carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur, microbes, and liquid water, either by itself or in combination. An operator must evaluate the partial pressure of each corrosive constituent, where applicable, by itself or in combination, to evaluate the effect of the corrosive constituents on the internal corrosion of the pipe and implement mitigation measures as necessary.

(b) The monitoring and mitigation program described in paragraph (a) of this section must include:

(1) The use of gas-quality monitoring methods at points where gas with potentially corrosive contaminants enters the pipeline to determine the gas stream constituents.

(2) Technology to mitigate the potentially corrosive gas stream constituents. Such technologies may include product sampling, inhibitor injections, in-line cleaning pigging, separators, or other technology that mitigates potentially corrosive effects.

(3) An evaluation at least once each calendar year, at intervals not to exceed 15 months, to ensure that potentially corrosive gas stream constituents are effectively monitored and mitigated.

(c) An operator must review its monitoring and mitigation program at least once each calendar year, at intervals not to exceed 15 months, and based on the results of its monitoring and mitigation program, implement adjustments, as necessary.
