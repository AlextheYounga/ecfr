##### ยง 192.481 Atmospheric corrosion control: Monitoring. #####

(a) Each operator must inspect and evaluate each pipeline or portion of the pipeline that is exposed to the atmosphere for evidence of atmospheric corrosion, as follows:

|           Pipeline type:            |                                                 Then the frequency of inspection is:                                                 |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|(1) Onshore other than a Service Line|                          At least once every 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.                           |
|      (2) Onshore Service Line       |At least once every 5 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 63 months, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section.|
|            (3) Offshore             |                            At least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months.                             |

(b) During inspections the operator must give particular attention to pipe at soil-to-air interfaces, under thermal insulation, under disbonded coatings, at pipe supports, in splash zones, at deck penetrations, and in spans over water.

(c) If atmospheric corrosion is found during an inspection, the operator must provide protection against the corrosion as required by ยง 192.479.

(d) If atmospheric corrosion is found on a service line during the most recent inspection, then the next inspection of that pipeline or portion of pipeline must be within 3 calendar years, but with intervals not exceeding 39 months.
