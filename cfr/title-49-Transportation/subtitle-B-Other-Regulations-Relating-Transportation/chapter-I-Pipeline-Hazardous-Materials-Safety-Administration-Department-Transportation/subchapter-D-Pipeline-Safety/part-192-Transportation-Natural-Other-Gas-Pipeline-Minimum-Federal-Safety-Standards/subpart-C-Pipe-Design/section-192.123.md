##### § 192.123 Design limitations for plastic pipe. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) and paragraph (f) of this section, the design pressure may not exceed a gauge pressure of 100 psig (689 kPa) for plastic pipe used in:

(1) Distribution systems; or

(2) Classes 3 and 4 locations.

(b) Plastic pipe may not be used where operating temperatures of the pipe will be:

(1) Below −20 °F (−20 °C), or −40 °F (−40 °C) if all pipe and pipeline components whose operating temperature will be below −29 °C (−20 °F) have a temperature rating by the manufacturer consistent with that operating temperature; or

(2) Above the following applicable temperatures:

(i) For thermoplastic pipe, the temperature at which the HDB used in the design formula under § 192.121 is determined.

(ii) For reinforced thermosetting plastic pipe, 150 °F (66 °C).

(c) The wall thickness for thermoplastic pipe may not be less than 0.062 inches (1.57 millimeters).

(d) The wall thickness for reinforced thermosetting plastic pipe may not be less than that listed in the following table:

|Nominal size in inches (millimeters).|Minimum wall thickness inches (millimeters).|
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|               2 (51)                |                0.060 (1.52)                |
|               3 (76)                |                0.060 (1.52)                |
|               4 (102)               |                0.070 (1.78)                |
|               6 (152)               |                0.100 (2.54)                |

(e) The design pressure for thermoplastic pipe produced after July 14, 2004 may exceed a gauge pressure of 100 psig (689 kPa) provided that:

(1) The design pressure does not exceed 125 psig (862 kPa);

(2) The material is a polyethylene (PE) pipe with the designation code as specified within ASTM D2513-09a (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7);

(3) The pipe size is nominal pipe size (IPS) 12 or less; and

(4) The design pressure is determined in accordance with the design equation defined in § 192.121.

(f) The design pressure for polyamide-11 (PA-11) pipe produced after January 23, 2009 may exceed a gauge pressure of 100 psig (689 kPa) provided that:

(1) The design pressure does not exceed 200 psig (1379 kPa);

(2) The pipe size is nominal pipe size (IPS or CTS) 4-inch or less; and

(3) The pipe has a standard dimension ratio of SDR-11 or greater (*i.e.*, thicker pipe wall).
