##### § 192.112 Additional design requirements for steel pipe using alternative maximum allowable operating pressure. #####

For a new or existing pipeline segment to be eligible for operation at the alternative maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) calculated under § 192.620, a segment must meet the following additional design requirements. Records for alternative MAOP must be maintained, for the useful life of the pipeline, demonstrating compliance with these requirements:

Test results and acceptance criteria addressing coating adhesion, cathodic disbondment, and coating condition must be provided to each PHMSA pipeline safety regional office where the pipeline is in service at least 60 days prior to operating above 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius). An operator must also notify a State pipeline safety authority when the pipeline is located in a State where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate pipeline is regulated by that State.                                                                                                                                       |

The monitoring program must include examinations using direct current voltage gradient (DCVG), alternating current voltage gradient (ACVG), or an equivalent method of monitoring coating integrity. An operator must specify the periodicity at which these examinations occur and criteria for repairing identified indications. An operator must submit its long-term coating integrity monitoring program to each PHMSA pipeline safety regional office in which the pipeline is located for review before the pipeline segments may be operated at temperatures in excess of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius). An operator must also notify a State pipeline safety authority when the pipeline is located in a State where PHMSA has an interstate agent agreement, or an intrastate pipeline is regulated by that State.|
