##### § 192.121 Design of plastic pipe. #####

Subject to the limitations of § 192.123, the design pressure for plastic pipe is determined by either of the following formulas:

In the absence of an HDB established at the specified temperature, the HDB of a higher temperature may be used in determining a design pressure rating at the specified temperature by arithmetic interpolation using the procedure in Part D.2 of PPI TR-3/2008, *HDB/PDB/SDB/MRS Policies* (incorporated by reference, *see* § 192.7). For reinforced thermosetting plastic pipe, 11,000 psig (75,842 kPa). [Note: Arithmetic interpolation is not allowed for PA-11 pipe.]t = Specified wall thickness, inches (mm).D = Specified outside diameter, inches (mm).SDR = Standard dimension ratio, the ratio of the average specified outside diameter to the minimum specified wall thickness, corresponding to a value from a common numbering system that was derived from the American National Standards Institute preferred number series 10.D F = 0.32 or= 0.40 for PA-11 pipe produced after January 23, 2009 with a nominal pipe size (IPS or CTS) 4-inch or less, and a SDR of 11 or greater (i.e. thicker pipe wall).[Amdt. 192-111, 74 FR 62505, Nov. 30, 2009, as amended by Amdt. 192-114, 75 FR 48603, Aug. 11, 2010]
