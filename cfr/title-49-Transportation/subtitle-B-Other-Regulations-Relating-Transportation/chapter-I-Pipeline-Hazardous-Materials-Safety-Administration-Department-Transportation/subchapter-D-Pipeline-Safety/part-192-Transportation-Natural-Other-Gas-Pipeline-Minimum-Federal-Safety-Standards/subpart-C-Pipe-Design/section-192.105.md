##### § 192.105 Design formula for steel pipe. #####

(a) The design pressure for steel pipe is determined in accordance with the following formula:

*P* = (2 *St/D*) × *F × E × T**P* = Design pressure in pounds per square inch (kPa) gauge.*S* = Yield strength in pounds per square inch (kPa) determined in accordance with § 192.107.*D* = Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches (millimeters).*t* = Nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches (millimeters). If this is unknown, it is determined in accordance with § 192.109. Additional wall thickness required for concurrent external loads in accordance with § 192.103 may not be included in computing design pressure.*F* = Design factor determined in accordance with § 192.111.*E* = Longitudinal joint factor determined in accordance with § 192.113.*T* = Temperature derating factor determined in accordance with § 192.115.

(b) If steel pipe that has been subjected to cold expansion to meet the SMYS is subsequently heated, other than by welding or stress relieving as a part of welding, the design pressure is limited to 75 percent of the pressure determined under paragraph (a) of this section if the temperature of the pipe exceeds 900 °F (482 °C) at any time or is held above 600 °F (316 °C) for more than 1 hour.
