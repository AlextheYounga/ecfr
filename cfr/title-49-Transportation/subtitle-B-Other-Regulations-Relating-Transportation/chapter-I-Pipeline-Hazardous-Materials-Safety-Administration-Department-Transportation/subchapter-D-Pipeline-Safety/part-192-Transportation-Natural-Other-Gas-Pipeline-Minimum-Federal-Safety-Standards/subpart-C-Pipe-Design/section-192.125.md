##### § 192.125 Design of copper pipe. #####

(a) Copper pipe used in mains must have a minimum wall thickness of 0.065 inches (1.65 millimeters) and must be hard drawn.

(b) Copper pipe used in service lines must have wall thickness not less than that indicated in the following table:

|Standard size inch (millimeter)|Nominal O.D. inch (millimeter)|Wall thickness inch (millimeter)|             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|
|            Nominal            |          Tolerance           |                                |             |
|           1/2 (13)            |          .625 (16)           |          .040 (1.06)           |.0035 (.0889)|
|           5/8 (16)            |          .750 (19)           |          .042 (1.07)           |.0035 (.0889)|
|           3/4 (19)            |          .875 (22)           |          .045 (1.14)           | .004 (.102) |
|            1 (25)             |          1.125 (29)          |          .050 (1.27)           | .004 (.102) |
|           11/4 (32)           |          1.375 (35)          |          .055 (1.40)           |.0045 (.1143)|
|           11/2 (38)           |          1.625 (41)          |          .060 (1.52)           |.0045 (.1143)|

(c) Copper pipe used in mains and service lines may not be used at pressures in excess of 100 p.s.i. (689 kPa) gage.

(d) Copper pipe that does not have an internal corrosion resistant lining may not be used to carry gas that has an average hydrogen sulfide content of more than 0.3 grains/100 ft3 (6.9/m3) under standard conditions. Standard conditions refers to 60 °F and 14.7 psia (15.6 °C and one atmosphere) of gas.
