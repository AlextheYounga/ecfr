##### ยง 191.23 Reporting safety-related conditions. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 52242, Oct. 1, 2019.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each operator shall report in accordance with ยง 191.25 the existence of any of the following safety-related conditions involving facilities in service:

(1) In the case of a pipeline (other than an LNG facility) that operates at a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of its specified minimum yield strength, general corrosion that has reduced the wall thickness to less than that required for the maximum allowable operating pressure, and localized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might result.

(2) In the case of an underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well, general corrosion that has reduced the wall thickness to less than that required for the maximum well operating pressure, and localized corrosion pitting to a degree where leakage might result.

(3) Unintended movement or abnormal loading by environmental causes, such as an earthquake, landslide, or flood, that impairs the serviceability of a pipeline or the structural integrity or reliability of an underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well for an underground natural gas storage facility, or LNG facility that contains, controls, or processes gas or LNG.

(4) Any crack or other material defect that impairs the structural integrity or reliability of an underground natural gas storage facility or LNG facility that contains, controls, or processes gas or LNG.

(5) Any material defect or physical damage that impairs the serviceability of a pipeline that operates at a hoop stress of 20% or more of its specified minimum yield strength or underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observations well for an underground natural gas storage facility.

(6) Any malfunction or operating error that causes the pressure of a pipeline or underground natural gas storage facility or LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG to rise above its maximum well operating pressure (or working pressure for LNG facilities) plus the margin (build-up) allowed for operation of pressure limiting or control devices.

(7) A leak in a pipeline or an underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well for an underground natural gas storage facility, or LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG that constitutes an emergency.

(8) Inner tank leakage, ineffective insulation, or frost heave that impairs the structural integrity of an LNG storage tank.

(9) Any safety-related condition that could lead to an imminent hazard and causes (either directly or indirectly by remedial action of the operator), for purposes other than abandonment, a 20% or more reduction in operating pressure or shutdown of operation of a pipeline or an underground natural gas storage facility, including injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well for an underground natural gas storage facility, or an LNG facility that contains or processes gas or LNG.

(b) A report is not required for any safety-related condition that -

(1) Exists on a master meter system or a customer-owned service line;

(2) Is an incident or results in an incident before the deadline for filing the safety-related condition report;

(3) Exists on a pipeline (other than an LNG facility or Underground Natural Gas Storage facility) that is more than 220 yards (200 meters) from any building intended for human occupancy or outdoor place of assembly, except that reports are required for conditions within the right-of-way of an active railroad, paved road, street, or highway; or

(4) Is corrected by repair or replacement in accordance with applicable safety standards before the deadline for filing the safety-related condition report, except that reports are required for conditions under paragraph (a)(1) of this section other than localized corrosion pitting on an effectively coated and cathodically protected pipeline.
