(a) *OPID request.* Effective January 1, 2012, each operator of a gas pipeline, gas pipeline facility, underground natural gas storage facility, LNG plant or LNG facility must obtain from PHMSA an Operator Identification Number (OPID). An OPID is assigned to an operator for the pipeline or pipeline system for which the operator has primary responsibility. To obtain an OPID, an operator must complete an OPID Assignment Request DOT Form PHMSA F 1000.1 through the National Registry of Pipeline, Underground Natural Gas Storage Facility, and LNG Operators in accordance with § 191.7.

(b) *OPID validation.* An operator who has already been assigned one or more OPID by January 1, 2011, must validate the information associated with each OPID through the National Registry of Pipeline, Underground Natural Gas Storage Facility, and LNG Operators at *http://opsweb.phmsa.dot.gov,* and correct that information as necessary, no later than June 30, 2012.

(c) *Changes.* Each operator of a gas pipeline, gas pipeline facility, underground natural gas storage facility, LNG plant, or LNG facility must notify PHMSA electronically through the National Registry of Pipeline, Underground Natural Gas Storage Facility, and LNG Operators at *http://opsweb.phmsa.dot.gov* of certain events.

(1) An operator must notify PHMSA of any of the following events not later than 60 days before the event occurs:

(i) Construction or any planned rehabilitation, replacement, modification, upgrade, uprate, or update of a facility, other than a section of line pipe, that costs $10 million or more. If 60 day notice is not feasible because of an emergency, an operator must notify PHMSA as soon as practicable;

(ii) Construction of 10 or more miles of a new or replacement pipeline;

(iii) Construction of a new LNG plant or LNG facility; or

(iv) Construction of a new underground natural gas storage facility or the abandonment, drilling or well workover (including replacement of wellhead, tubing, or a new casing) of an injection, withdrawal, monitoring, or observation well for an underground natural gas storage facility.

(v) Reversal of product flow direction when the reversal is expected to last more than 30 days. This notification is not required for pipeline systems already designed for bi-directional flow; or

(ii) A change in the name of the operator;

(iii) A change in the entity (*e.g.,* company, municipality) responsible for an existing pipeline, pipeline segment, pipeline facility, underground natural gas storage facility, or LNG facility;

(iv) The acquisition or divestiture of 50 or more miles of a pipeline or pipeline system subject to Part 192 of this subchapter;

(v) The acquisition or divestiture of an existing LNG plant or LNG facility subject to Part 193 of this subchapter; or

(vi) The acquisition or divestiture of an existing underground natural gas storage facility subject to part 192 of this subchapter.
