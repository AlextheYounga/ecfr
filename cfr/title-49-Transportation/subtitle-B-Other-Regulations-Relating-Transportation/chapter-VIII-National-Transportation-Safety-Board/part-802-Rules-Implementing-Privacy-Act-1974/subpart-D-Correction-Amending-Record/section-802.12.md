##### § 802.12 Initial adverse agency determination on correction or amendment. #####

If the System Manager determines that the record should not be corrected or amended in whole or in part, he will forthwith make such finding in writing, after consulting with the General Counsel, or his designee. The requester shall be notified of the refusal to correct or amend the record. The notification shall be in writing, signed by the System Manager, and shall include—

(a) The reason for the denial;

(b) The name and title or position of each person responsible for the denial of the request;

(c) The appeal procedures for the individual for a review of the denial; and

(d) Notice that the denial from the System Manager is appealable within 30 days from the receipt thereof by the requester to the Board.

The System Manager is allotted 10 working days (or within such extended period as is provided in the section concerning “unusual circumstances” *infra*) to respond to the request for review. If the requester does not receive an answer within such time, the delay shall constitute a denial of the request and shall permit the requester immediately to appeal to the Board, or to a district court.
