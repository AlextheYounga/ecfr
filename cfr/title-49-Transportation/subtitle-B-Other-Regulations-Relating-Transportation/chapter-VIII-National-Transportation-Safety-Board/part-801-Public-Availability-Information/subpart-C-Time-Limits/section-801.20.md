##### ยง 801.20 Processing of requests. #####

(a) The NTSB processes FOIA requests upon receipt. The NTSB FOIA Office may notify the requester that the NTSB has received the request. The FOIA Office will then place each request on one of three tracks:

(1) Track 1: Requests for which there are no records, requests that meet the criteria for expedited processing, or requests that seek records that have been produced in response to a prior request.

(2) Track 2: Requests that do not involve voluminous records or lengthy consultations with other entities.

(3) Track 3: Requests that involve voluminous records and for which lengthy or numerous consultations are required, or those requests which may involve sensitive records.

(b) Regarding expedited processing, if a requester states that he or she has a compelling need for the expedited treatment of their request, then the NTSB FOIA Office will determine whether to expedite the request and, where appropriate, do so.
