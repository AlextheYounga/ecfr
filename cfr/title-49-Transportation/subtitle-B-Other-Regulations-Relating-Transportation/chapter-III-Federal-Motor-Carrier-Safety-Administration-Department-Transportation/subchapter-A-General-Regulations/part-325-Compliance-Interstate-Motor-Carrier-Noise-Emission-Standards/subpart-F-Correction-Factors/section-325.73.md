##### § 325.73 Microphone distance correction factors.1 #####

1 Table 1, in § 325.7 is a tabulation of the maximum allowable sound level readings taking into account both the distance correction factors contained in § 325.73 and the ground surface correction factors contained in § 325.75.

If the distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point is other than 50 feet (15.2 m), the maximum observed sound level reading generated by the motor vehicle in accordance with § 325.39 of this part or the numerical average of the recorded maximum observed sound level readings generated by the motor vehicle in accordance with § 325.59 of this part shall be corrected as specified in the following table:

|If the distance between the microphone location point and the microphone target point is|The value dB(A) to be applied to the observed sound level reading is—|
