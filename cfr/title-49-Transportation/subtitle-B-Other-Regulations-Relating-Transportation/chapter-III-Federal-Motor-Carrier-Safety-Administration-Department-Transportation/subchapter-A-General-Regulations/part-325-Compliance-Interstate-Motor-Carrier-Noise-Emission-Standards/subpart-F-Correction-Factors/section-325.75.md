##### § 325.75 Ground surface correction factors. 1 #####

1 Table 1, in § 325.7 is a tabulation of the maximum allowable sound level readings taking into account both the distance correction factors contained in § 325.73 and the ground surface correction factors contained in § 325.75.

(a) *Highway operations.* When measurements are made in accordance with the rules in subpart D of this part upon a test site which is “hard,” a correction factor of 2 dB(A) shall be subtracted from the maximum observed sound level reading generated by the motor vehicle to determine whether the motor vehicle conforms to the Standards for Highway Operations, 40 CFR 202.20.

(b) *Stationary test.* When measurements are made in accordance with the rules in subpart E of this part upon a test site which is “soft,” a correction factor of 2 dB(A) shall be added to the numerical average of the recorded maximum observed sound level readings generated by the motor vehicle to determine whether the motor vehicle conforms to the Standard for Operation Under Stationary Test, 40 CFR 202.21.
