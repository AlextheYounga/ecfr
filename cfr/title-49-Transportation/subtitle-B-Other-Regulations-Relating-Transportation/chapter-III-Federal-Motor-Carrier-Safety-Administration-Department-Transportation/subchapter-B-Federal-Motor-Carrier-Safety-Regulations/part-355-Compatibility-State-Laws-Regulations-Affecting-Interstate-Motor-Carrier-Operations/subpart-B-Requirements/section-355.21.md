##### § 355.21 Regulatory review. #####

(a) *General.* Each State shall annually analyze its laws and regulations, including those of its political subdivisions, which pertain to commercial motor vehicle safety to determine whether its laws and regulations are compatible with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. Guidelines for the regulatory review are provided in the appendix to this part.

(b) *Responsibility.* The State agency designated as lead agency for the administration of grants made pursuant to part 350 of this subchapter is responsible for reviewing and analyzing State laws and regulations for compliance with this part. In the absence of an officially designated Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) lead agency or in its discretion, the State shall designate another agency responsible to review and determine compliance with these regulations.

(c) *State review.* (1) The State shall determine which of its laws and regulations pertaining to commercial motor vehicle safety are the same as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety or Federal Hazardous Materials Regulations. With respect to any State law or regulation which is not the same as the FMCSRs (FHMRs must be identical), the State shall identify such law or regulation and determine whether:

(i) It has the same effect as a corresponding section of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations;

(ii) It applies to interstate commerce;

(iii) It is more stringent than the FMCSRs in that it is more restrictive or places a greater burden on any entity subject to its provisions.

(2) If the inconsistent State law or regulation applies to interstate commerce and is more stringent than the FMCSRs, the State shall determine:

(i) The safety benefits associated with such State law or regulation; and

(ii) The effect of the enforcement of such State law or regulation on interstate commerce.

(3) If the inconsistent State law or regulation does not apply to interstate commerce or is less stringent than the FMCSRs, the guidelines for participation in the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program in §§ 350.341, 350.343, and 350.345 of this subchapter shall apply.
