##### § 350.213 What must a State CVSP include? #####

The State's CVSP must reflect a performance-based program, and contain the following eighteen items:

(a) A general overview section that must include the following two items:

(1) A statement of the State agency goal or mission.

(2) A program summary of the effectiveness of the prior years' activities in reducing CMV accidents, injuries and fatalities, and improving driver and motor carrier safety performance. Data periods used must be consistent from year to year. This may be calendar year or fiscal year or any 12-month period of time for which the State's data is current. The summary must show trends supported by safety and program performance data collected over several years. It must identify safety or performance problems in the State and those problems must be addressed in the new or modified CVSP.

(b) A brief narrative describing how the State program addresses the national program elements listed in § 350.109. The plan must address these elements even if there are no planned activities in a program area. The rationale for the resource allocation decision must be explained. The narrative section must include a description of how the State supports the activities identified in § 350.201(q) and (t).

(1) Activities aimed at removing impaired CMV drivers from the highways through adequate enforcement of restrictions on the use of alcohol and controlled substances and by ensuring ready roadside access to alcohol detection and measuring equipment.

(2) Activities aimed at providing an appropriate level of training to MCSAP personnel to recognize drivers impaired by alcohol or controlled substances.

(3) Criminal interdiction activities, including human trafficking, and appropriate strategies for carrying out those interdiction activities, including interdiction activities affecting the transportation of controlled substances by any occupant of a CMV.

(4) Activities to enforce registration requirements under 49 U.S.C. 13902 and 31134 and to cooperate in the enforcement of financial responsibility requirements under 49 U.S.C. 13906, 31138 and 31139 and 49 CFR part 387.

(c) A definitive problem statement for each objective, supported by data or other information. The CVSP must identify the source of the data, and who is responsible for its collection, maintenance, and analysis.

(d) Performance objectives, stated in quantifiable terms, to be achieved through the State plan. Objectives must include a measurable reduction in highway accidents or hazardous materials incidents involving CMVs. The objective may also include documented improvements in other program areas (e.g., legislative or regulatory authority, enforcement results, or resource allocations).

(e) Strategies to be employed to achieve performance objectives. Strategies may include education, enforcement, legislation, use of technology and improvements to safety infrastructure.

(f) Specific activities intended to achieve the stated strategies and objectives. Planned activities must be eligible under this program as defined in §§ 350.309 and 350.311.

(g) Specific quantifiable performance measures, as appropriate. These performance measures will be used to assist the State in monitoring the progress of its program and preparing an annual evaluation.

(h) A description of the State's method for ongoing monitoring of the progress of its plan. This should include who will conduct the monitoring, the frequency with which it will be carried out, and how and to whom reports will be made.

(i) An objective evaluation that discusses the progress towards individual objectives listed under the “Performance Objectives” section of the previous year's CVSP and identifies any safety or performance problems discovered. States will identify those problems as new objectives or make modifications to the existing objectives in the next CVSP.

(j) A budget which supports the CVSP, describing the expenditures for allocable costs such as personnel and related costs, equipment purchases, printing, information systems costs, and other eligible costs consistent with §§ 350.311 and 350.309.

(k) A budget summary form including planned expenditures for that fiscal year and projected number of activities in each national program element, except data collection.

(l) The results of the annual review to determine the compatibility of State laws and regulations with the FMCSRs and HMRs.

(m) A copy of any new law or regulation affecting CMV safety enforcement that was enacted by the State since the last CVSP was submitted.

(n) Executed State Certification as outlined in § 350.211.

(o) List of MCSAP contacts.

(p) Annual Certification of Compatibility, § 350.331.

(q) State Training Plan.
