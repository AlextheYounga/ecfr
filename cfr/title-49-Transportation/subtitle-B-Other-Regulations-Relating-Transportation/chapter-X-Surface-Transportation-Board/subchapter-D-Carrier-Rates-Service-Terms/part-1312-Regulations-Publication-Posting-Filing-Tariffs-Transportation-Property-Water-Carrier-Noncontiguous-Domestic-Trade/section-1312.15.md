##### ยง 1312.15 Change of carrier or agent. #####

(a) *Change in carrier.* When a carrier's name is lawfully changed, or a fiduciary assumes possession and control of a carrier's property, all affected tariffs must be amended to reflect the change. The amendments required by this paragraph shall be filed promptly and, if possible, prior to their effective date, but in no case later than 60 days thereafter. Regardless of the date the tariff is actually filed, the effective date for an amendment required by this paragraph is the date the event occurs.

(b) *Change of agent.* When a new agent is appointed to take over an agency, or when an alternate agent assumes the duties of the principal agent, each of the superseded agent's effective tariffs shall immediately be amended to reflect the change, bearing an effective date the same as the date of the transfer. In the case of a new agent, this may only occur after one or more of the participating carriers issues a power of attorney to the new agent, and revokes the previous power of attorney. At the same time, all affected tariffs will be amended to reflect the new powers of attorney, and all carriers who have not issued them must be canceled from the tariff.
