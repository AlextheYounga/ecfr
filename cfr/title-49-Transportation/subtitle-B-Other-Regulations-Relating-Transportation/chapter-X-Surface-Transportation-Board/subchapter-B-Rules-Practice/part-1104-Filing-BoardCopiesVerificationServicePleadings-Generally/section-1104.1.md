Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 15078, Apr. 9, 2018.

(a) Except as provided in § 1115.7, pleadings should be addressed to the “Chief, Section of Administration, Office of Proceedings, Surface Transportation Board, Washington, DC 20423-0001,” and should designate the docket number and title of the proceeding, if known.

(b) The address of the person filing the pleading should be included on the first page of the pleading.

(c) All envelopes in which a pleading is being submitted should be marked in the lower left hand corner with the docket number, if known, (not the full title) and the pleading type.

(d) All multi-volume pleadings must be sequentially numbered on the cover of each volume to indicate the volume number of the pleading and the total number of volumes filed (e.g., the first volume in a 4-volume set should be labeled “volume 1 of 4,” the second volume “volume 2 of 4” and so forth).

(e) Persons filing pleadings and documents with the Board have the option of electronically filing (e-filing) certain types of pleadings and documents instead of filing paper copies. Details regarding the types of pleadings and documents eligible for e-filing, the procedures to be followed, and other pertinent information are available on the Board's Web site, *http://www.stb.dot.gov.* If the e-filing option is chosen (for those pleadings and documents that are appropriate for e-filing, as determined by reference to the information on the Board's Web site), then the applicable requirements will be those specified on the Web site, and any requirements of 49 CFR part 1104 that are specifically applicable to filing of paper copies will not apply to the e-filed pleadings and documents (these requirements include, but are not limited to, number of copies, stapling or binding specifications, submission of compact disks or floppy diskettes for documents of 20 pages or more, signature “in ink,” etc.). Persons are not required to e-file, and may continue to use the Board's processes for filing paper copies.
