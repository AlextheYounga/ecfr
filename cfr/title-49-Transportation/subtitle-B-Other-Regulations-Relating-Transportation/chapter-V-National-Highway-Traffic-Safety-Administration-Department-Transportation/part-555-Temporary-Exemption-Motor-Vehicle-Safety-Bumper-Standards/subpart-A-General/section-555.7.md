(a) The NHTSA publishes in the Federal Register, affording opportunity for comment, a notice of each application containing the information required by this part. However, if the NHTSA finds that an application does not contain the information required by this part, it so informs the applicant, pointing out the areas of insufficiency and stating that the application will not receive further consideration until the required information is submitted.

(b) No public hearing, argument, or other formal proceeding is held directly on an application filed under this part before its disposition under this section.

(c) Any interested person may, upon written request, appear informally before an appropriate official of the NHTSA to discuss an application for exemption or the action taken in response to a petition.

(d) If the Administrator determines that the application does not contain adequate justification, he denies it and notifies the petitioner in writing. He also publishes in the Federal Register a notice of the denial and the reasons for it.

(e) If the Administrator determines that the application contains adequate justification, he grants it, and notifies the petitioner in writing. He also publishes in the Federal Register a notice of the grant and the reasons for it.

(f) Unless a later effective date is specified in the notice of the grant, a temporary exemption is effective upon publication of the notice in the Federal Register and exempts vehicles manufactured on and after the effective date.
