|<sup>1</sup> Accuracy requirement only applies within the range of the physical sensor. For vehicles manufactured after September 1, 2014, if measurements captured by a sensor exceed the design range of the sensor, the reported element must indicate when the measurement first exceeded the design range of the sensor.|                                                                 |                         |                          |

(b) Acceleration Time-History data and format: the longitudinal, lateral, and normal acceleration time-history data, as applicable, must be filtered either during the recording phase or during the data downloading phase to include:

(1) The Time Step (TS) that is the inverse of the sampling frequency of the acceleration data and which has units of seconds;

(2) The number of the first point (NFP), which is an integer that when multiplied by the TS equals the time relative to time zero of the first acceleration data point;

(3) The number of the last point (NLP), which is an integer that when multiplied by the TS equals the time relative to time zero of the last acceleration data point; and

(4) NLP—NFP + 1 acceleration values sequentially beginning with the acceleration at time NFP \* TS and continue sampling the acceleration at TS increments in time until the time NLP \* TS is reached.
