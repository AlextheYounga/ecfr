(ii) Comply separately with the two standards specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) For model year 1979, the standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section for 4-wheel drive light trucks applies only to 4-wheel drive general utility vehicles. All other 4-wheel drive light trucks in that model year shall be included in the 2-wheel drive category for compliance purposes.

(c) For model years 1980 and 1981, manufacturers of limited product line light trucks may:

(1) Comply with the separate standard for limited product line light trucks, or

(2) Comply with the other standards specified in § 533.5(a), as applicable.

(d) For model years 1982-91, each manufacture may:

(1) Combine its 2- and 4-wheel drive light trucks (segregating captive import and other light trucks) and comply with the combined average fuel economy standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section; or

(2) Comply separately with the 2-wheel drive standards and the 4-wheel drive standards (segregating captive import and other light trucks) specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(e) For model year 1992, each manufacturer shall comply with the average fuel economy standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section (segregating captive import and other light trucks).

(f) For each model year 1996 and thereafter, each manufacturer shall combine its captive imports with its other light trucks and comply with the fleet average fuel economy standard in paragraph (a) of this section.

(g) For model years 2008-2010, at a manufacturer's option, a manufacturer's light truck fleet may comply with the fuel economy standard calculated for each model year according to Figure 1 and the appropriate values in Table V, with said option being irrevocably chosen for that model year and reported as specified in § 537.8.

(h) For model year 2011, a manufacturer's light truck fleet shall comply with the fleet average fuel economy standard calculated for that model year according to Figure 1 and the appropriate values in Table V.

(i) For model years 2012-2016, a manufacturer's light truck fleet shall comply with the fleet average fuel economy standard calculated for that model year according to Figures 2 and 3 and the appropriate values in Table VI.

(j) For model years 2017-2025, a manufacturer's light truck fleet shall comply with the fleet average fuel economy standard calculated for that model year according to Figures 2 and 4 and the appropriate values in Table VII.

(k) For model years 2022-2025, each manufacturer shall comply with the standards set forth in paragraph (j) in this section, if NHTSA determines in a rulemaking, initiated after January 1, 2017, and conducted in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 32902, that the standards in paragraph (j) are the maximum feasible standards for model years 2022-2025. If, for any of those model years, NHTSA determines that the maximum feasible standard for light trucks should be set at a different level, manufacturers shall comply with those different standards in lieu of the standards set forth for those model years in paragraph (j), and NHTSA will revise this section to reflect the different standards.
