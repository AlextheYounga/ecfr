(f) For each model year 1996 and thereafter, each manufacturer shall combine its captive imports with its other light trucks and comply with the fleet average fuel economy standard in paragraph (a) of this section.

(g) For model years 2008-2010, at a manufacturer's option, a manufacturer's light truck fleet may comply with the fuel economy standard calculated for each model year according to Figure 1 and the appropriate values in Table V, with said option being irrevocably chosen for that model year and reported as specified in ยง 537.8.

(h) For model year 2011, a manufacturer's light truck fleet shall comply with the fleet average fuel economy standard calculated for that model year according to Figure 1 and the appropriate values in Table V.

(k) For model years 2022-2025, each manufacturer shall comply with the standards set forth in paragraph (j) in this section, if NHTSA determines in a rulemaking, initiated after January 1, 2017, and conducted in accordance with 49 U.S.C. 32902, that the standards in paragraph (j) are the maximum feasible standards for model years 2022-2025. If, for any of those model years, NHTSA determines that the maximum feasible standard for light trucks should be set at a different level, manufacturers shall comply with those different standards in lieu of the standards set forth for those model years in paragraph (j), and NHTSA will revise this section to reflect the different standards.
