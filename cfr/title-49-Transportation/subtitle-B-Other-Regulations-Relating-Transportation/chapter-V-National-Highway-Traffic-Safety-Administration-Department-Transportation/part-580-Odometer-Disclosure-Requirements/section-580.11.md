##### § 580.11 Petition for approval of alternate disclosure requirements. #####

(a) A State may petition NHTSA for approval of disclosure requirements which differ from the disclosure requirements of § 580.5, § 580.7, or § 580.13(f) of this part.

(b) Each petition filed under this section shall -

(1) Be written in the English language;

(2) Be submitted to the Office of Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590;

(3) Set forth the motor vehicle disclosure requirements in effect in the State, including a copy of the applicable State law or regulation; and

(4) Explain how the State motor vehicle disclosure requirements are consistent with the purposes of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act.

(c) Notice of the petition and an initial determination pending a 30-day comment period will be published in the Federal Register. Notice of final grant or denial of a petition for approval of alternate motor vehicle disclosure requirements will be published in the Federal Register. The effect of the grant of a petition is to relieve a State from responsibility to conform the State disclosure requirements with § 580.5, § 580.7, or § 580.13(f), as applicable, for as long as the approved alternate disclosure requirements remain in effect in that State. The effect of a denial is to require a State to conform to the requirements of § 580.5, § 580.7 or § 580.13(f), as applicable, of this part until such time as the NHTSA approves any alternate motor vehicle disclosure requirements.
