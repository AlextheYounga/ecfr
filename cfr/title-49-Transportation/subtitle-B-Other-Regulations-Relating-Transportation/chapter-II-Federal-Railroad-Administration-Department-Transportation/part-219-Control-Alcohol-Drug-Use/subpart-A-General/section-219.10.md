Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 5733, Feb. 2, 2022.

Any person, as defined by § 219.5, who violates any requirement of this part or causes the violation of any such requirement is subject to a civil penalty of at least $919 and not more than $30,058 per violation, except that: Penalties may be assessed against individuals only for willful violations; where a grossly negligent violation or a pattern of repeated violations has created an imminent hazard of death or injury, or has caused death or injury, a penalty not to exceed $120,231 per violation may be assessed; and the standard of liability for a railroad will vary depending upon the requirement involved. See, *e.g.,* § 219.105, which is construed to qualify the responsibility of a railroad for the unauthorized conduct of an employee that violates § 219.101 or § 219.102 (while imposing a duty of due diligence to prevent such conduct). Each day a violation continues constitutes a separate offense. See FRA's website at *www.fra.dot.gov* for a statement of agency civil penalty policy.
