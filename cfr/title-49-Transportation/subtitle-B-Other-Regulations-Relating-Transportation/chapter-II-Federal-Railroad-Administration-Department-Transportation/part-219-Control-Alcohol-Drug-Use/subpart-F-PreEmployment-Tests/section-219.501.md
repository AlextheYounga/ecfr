##### ยง 219.501 Pre-employment drug testing. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 37936, June 10, 2016.

(a) Prior to the first time a covered employee performs covered service for a railroad, the employee must undergo testing for drugs. No railroad may allow a covered employee to perform covered service, unless the employee has been administered a test for drugs with a result that did not indicate the misuse of controlled substances. This requirement applies to final applicants for employment and to employees seeking to transfer for the first time from non-covered service to duties involving covered service.

(b) As used in subpart H of this part with respect to a test required under this subpart, the term covered employee includes an applicant for pre-employment testing only. In the case of an applicant who declines to be tested and withdraws the application for employment, no record may be maintained of the declination.
