Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 37937, June 10, 2016.

An applicant who has refused to submit to pre-employment testing under this section may not be employed in covered service based upon the application and examination with respect to which such refusal was made. This section does not create any right on the part of the applicant to have a subsequent application considered; nor does it restrict the discretion of the railroad to entertain a subsequent application for employment from the same person.
