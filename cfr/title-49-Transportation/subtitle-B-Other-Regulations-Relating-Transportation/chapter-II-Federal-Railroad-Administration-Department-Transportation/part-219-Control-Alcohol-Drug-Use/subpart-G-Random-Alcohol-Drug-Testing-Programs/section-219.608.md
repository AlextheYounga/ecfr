##### § 219.608 FRA Administrator's determination of random alcohol testing rate. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing must be 25 percent of covered employees.

(b) The Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is based on the violation rate for the entire industry. All information used for the determination is drawn from the alcohol MIS reports required by this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from employers, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry violation rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.

(c)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or more, the Administrator may lower this rate to 10 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of § 219.800 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 0.5 percent.

(2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of § 219.800 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the violation rate is less than 1.0 percent but equal to or greater than 0.5 percent.

(d)(1) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 10 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of § 219.800 for that calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 0.5 percent, but less than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 25 percent of all covered employees.

(2) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing is 25 percent or less, and the data received under the reporting requirements of § 219.800 for any calendar year indicate that the violation rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.

(e) The railroad must randomly select and test a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing determined by the Administrator. If the railroad conducts random alcohol testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual employer or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT agency alcohol testing rule.

(f) If a railroad is required to conduct random alcohol testing under the alcohol testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the railroad may -

(1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or

(2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the railroad is subject.
