##### ยง 219.602 FRA Administrator's determination of random drug testing rate. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing must be 50 percent of covered employees.

(b) The FRA Administrator's decision to increase or decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based on the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for this determination is drawn from the drug MIS reports required by this part. In order to ensure reliability of the data, the Administrator considers the quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional information or reports from railroads, and may make appropriate modifications in calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing will be applicable starting January 1 of the calendar year following publication.

(c) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the Administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if the Administrator determines that the data received under the reporting requirements of ยง 219.800 for two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is less than 1.0 percent.

(d) When the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the data received under the reporting requirements of ยง 219.800 for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the Administrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing to 50 percent of all covered employees.

(e) Selection of covered employees for testing must be made by a method employing objective, neutral criteria which ensures that every covered employee has a substantially equal statistical chance of being selected within a specified time frame. The method may not permit subjective factors to play a role in selection, i.e., no employee may be selected as a result of the exercise of discretion by the railroad. The selection method must be capable of verification with respect to the randomness of the selection process.

(f) The railroad must randomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during each calendar year to equal an annual rate not less than the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing determined by the Administrator. If the railroad conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of employees to be tested may be calculated for each individual railroad or may be based on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who are subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate under this part or any DOT agency drug testing rule.

(g) Each railroad must ensure that random drug tests conducted under this part are unannounced and that the dates for administering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar year.

(h) If a given covered employee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency for the same railroad, the employee must be subject to random drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by the DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's function.

(i) If a railroad is required to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more than one DOT agency, the railroad may -

(1) Establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the covered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or

(2) Randomly select such employees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the calendar year by any DOT agency to which the railroad is subject.
