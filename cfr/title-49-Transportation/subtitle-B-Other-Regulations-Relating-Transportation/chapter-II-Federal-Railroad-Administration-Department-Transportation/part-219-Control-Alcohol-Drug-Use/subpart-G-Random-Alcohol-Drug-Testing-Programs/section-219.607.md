(a) *General.* A random testing plan that a railroad submits under this subpart must address and comply with the requirements of this subpart. The railroad must also comply with these requirements in implementing the plan.

(b) *Model random testing plan.* A railroad (or a contractor or service agent that submits a part 219-compliant random testing plan to a railroad for submission as a part of the railroad's random testing plan) may complete, modify if necessary, and submit a plan based on the FRA model random testing plan that can be downloaded from FRA's Drug and Alcohol Program Web site.

(c) *Specific plan requirements.* Each random testing plan must contain the following items of information, each of which must be contained in a separate, clearly identified section:

(2) Total number of maintenance-of-way employees, including maintenance-of-way contractor employees and volunteers;

Individual collection sites do not have to be identified;

(7) Number of random testing pools and the proposed general pool entry assignments for each pool.

(11) If a railroad makes alternate selections, under what limited circumstances these alternate selections will be tested (see ยง 219.613);

(12) Frequency of random selections (*e.g.,* monthly);

(13) Designated testing window.
