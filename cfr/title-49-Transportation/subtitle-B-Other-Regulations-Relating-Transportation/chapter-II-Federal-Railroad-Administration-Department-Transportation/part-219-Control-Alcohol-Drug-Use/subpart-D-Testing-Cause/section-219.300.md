Such observations may include indications of the chronic and withdrawal effects of drugs.

(b)(1) With respect to an alcohol test, the required observations must be made by a supervisor trained in accordance with ยง 219.11(g). The supervisor who makes the determination that reasonable suspicion exists may not conduct testing on that employee.
