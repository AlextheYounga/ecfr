(a) Testing under this subpart may only be conducted promptly following the observations or events upon which the testing decision is based, consistent with the need to protect life and property.

(b) No employee may be required to participate in alcohol or drug testing under this section after the expiration of an eight-hour period from -

(2) In the case of an accident/incident, the time a responsible railroad supervisor receives notice of the event providing reasonable cause for conduct of the test.

(d) As used in this subpart, a “responsible railroad supervisor” means any responsible line supervisor (e.g., a trainmaster or road foreman of engines) or superior official in authority over the employee to be tested.

(e) In the case of a drug test, the eight-hour requirement is satisfied if the employee has been delivered to the collection site (where the collector is present) and the request has been made to commence collection of the drug testing specimens within that period.

(f) [Reserved]

(g) Section 219.23 prescribes the notice to an employee that is required to provide breath or a body fluid specimen under this part.
