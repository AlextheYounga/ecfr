##### § 219.104 Responsive action. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 37929, June 10, 2016.

(a) *Removal from covered service.* (1) If the railroad determines that an employee has violated § 219.101 or § 219.102, or the alcohol or controlled substances misuse rule of another DOT agency, the railroad must immediately remove the employee from covered service and the procedures described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section apply.

(2) If an employee refuses to provide breath or a body fluid specimen or specimens when required to by the railroad under a mandatory provision of this part, the railroad must immediately remove the employee from covered service, and the procedures described in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section apply.

(3)(i) This section does not apply to actions based on breath or body fluid tests for alcohol or drugs that are conducted exclusively under authority other than that provided in this part (e.g., testing under a company medical policy, for-cause testing policy wholly independent of subpart D of this part, or testing under a labor agreement).

(ii) This section and the information requirements listed in § 219.23 do not apply to applicants who refuse to submit to a pre-employment test or who have a pre-employment test with a result indicating the misuse of alcohol or controlled substances.

(b) *Notice.* Prior to or upon withdrawing the employee from covered service under this section, the railroad must provide notice to the employee of the reason for this action.

(c) *Hearing procedures.* (1) If the employee denies that the test result is valid evidence of alcohol or drug use prohibited by this subpart, the employee may demand and must be provided an opportunity for a prompt post-suspension hearing before a presiding officer other than the charging official. This hearing may be consolidated with any disciplinary hearing arising from the same accident or incident (or conduct directly related thereto), but the presiding officer must make separate findings as to compliance with §§ 219.101 and 219.102.

(2) The hearing must be convened within the period specified in the applicable collective bargaining agreement. In the absence of an agreement provision, the employee may demand that the hearing be convened within 10 calendar days of the suspension or, in the case of an employee who is unavailable due to injury, illness, or other sufficient cause, within 10 days of the date the employee becomes available for hearing.

(3) A post-suspension proceeding conforming to the requirements of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, together with the provisions for adjustment of disputes under sec. 3 of the Railway Labor Act (49 U.S.C. 153), satisfies the procedural requirements of this paragraph (c).

(4) Nothing in this part may be deemed to abridge any additional procedural rights or remedies not inconsistent with this part that are available to the employee under a collective bargaining agreement, the Railway Labor Act, or (with respect to employment at will) at common law with respect to the removal or other adverse action taken as a consequence of a positive test result in a test authorized or required by this part.

(5) Nothing in this part restricts the discretion of the railroad to treat an employee's denial of prohibited alcohol or drug use as a waiver of any privilege the employee would otherwise enjoy to have such prohibited alcohol or drug use treated as a non-disciplinary matter or to have discipline held in abeyance.

(d) The railroad must comply with the return-to-service and follow-up testing requirements, and the Substance Abuse Professional conflict-of-interest prohibitions, contained in §§ 40.305, 40.307, and 40.299 of this title, respectively.
