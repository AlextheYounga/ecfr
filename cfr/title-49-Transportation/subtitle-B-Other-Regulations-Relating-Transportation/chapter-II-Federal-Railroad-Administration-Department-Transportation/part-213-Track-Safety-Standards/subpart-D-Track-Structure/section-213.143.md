(b) For any heavy-point frog (HPF) on Class 5 track, the guard check gage may be less than 4′61/2″ but not be less than 4′63/8″, provided that:

(1) Each HPF and guard rails on both rails through the turnout are equipped with at least three serviceable through-gage plates with elastic rail fasteners and guard rail braces that permit adjustment of the guard check gage without removing spikes or other fasteners from the crossties; and

(2) Each HPF bears an identifying mark applied by either the track owner, railroad, or the frog manufacturer that identifies the frog as an HPF.
