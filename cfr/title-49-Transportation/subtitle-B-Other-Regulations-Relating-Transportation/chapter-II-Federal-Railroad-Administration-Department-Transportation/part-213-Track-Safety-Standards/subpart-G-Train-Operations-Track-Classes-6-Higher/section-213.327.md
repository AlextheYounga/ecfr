##### § 213.327 Track alinement. #####

(a) Uniformity at any point along the track is established by averaging the measured mid-chord offset values for nine consecutive points that are centered around that point and spaced according to the following table:

|Chord length|Spacing|
|------------|-------|
|    31′     | 7′9″  |
|    62′     | 15′6″ |
|    124′    | 31′0″ |

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a single alinement deviation from uniformity may not be more than the amount prescribed in the following table:

|Class of track|Tangent/  <br/>Curved track|The deviation from uniformity of the mid-chord offset for a 31-foot chord may not be more than—(inches)|The deviation from uniformity of the mid-chord offset for a 62-foot chord may not be more than—(inches)|The deviation from uniformity of the mid-chord offset for a 124-foot chord may not be more than—(inches)|

(e) For purposes of complying with this section, the ends of the chord shall be at points on the gage side of the rail, five-eighths of an inch below the top of the railhead. On tangent track, either rail may be used as the line rail; however, the same rail shall be used for the full length of that tangential segment of the track. On curved track, the line rail is the outside rail of the curve.
