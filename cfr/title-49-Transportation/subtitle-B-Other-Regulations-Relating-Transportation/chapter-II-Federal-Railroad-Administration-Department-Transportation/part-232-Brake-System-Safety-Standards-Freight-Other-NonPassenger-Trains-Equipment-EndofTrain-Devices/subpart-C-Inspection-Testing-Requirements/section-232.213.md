##### § 232.213 Extended haul trains. #####

(a) A railroad may be permitted to move a train up to, but not exceeding, 1,500 miles between brake tests and inspections if the railroad designates a train as an extended haul train. In order for a railroad to designate a train as an extended haul train, all of the following requirements must be met:

(1) The railroad must designate the train in writing to FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety. This designation must include the following:

(i) The train identification symbol or identification of the location where extended haul trains will originate and a description of the trains that will be operated as extended haul trains from those locations;

(ii) The origination and destination points for the train;

(iii) The type or types of equipment the train will haul; and

(iv) The locations where all train brake and mechanical inspections and tests will be performed.

(2) A Class I brake test pursuant to § 232.205 shall be performed at the initial terminal for the train by a qualified mechanical inspector as defined in § 232.5.

(3) A freight car inspection pursuant to part 215 of this chapter shall be performed at the initial terminal for the train and shall be performed by an inspector designated under § 215.11 of this chapter.

(4) All cars having conditions not in compliance with part 215 of this chapter at the initial terminal for the train shall be either repaired or removed from the train. Except for a car developing such a condition en route, no car shall be moved pursuant to the provisions of § 215.9 of this chapter in the train.

(5) The train shall have no more than one pick-up and one set-out en route, except for the set-out of defective equipment pursuant to the requirements of this chapter.

(i) Cars added to the train en route shall be inspected pursuant to the requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(5) of this section at the location where they are added to the train.

(ii) Cars set out of the train en route shall be inspected pursuant to the requirements contained in paragraph (a)(6) of this section at the location where they are set out of the train.

(6) In order for an extended haul train to proceed beyond 1,500 miles, the following requirements shall be met:

(i) If the train will move 1,000 miles or less from that location before receiving a Class IA brake test or reaching destination, a Class I brake test shall be conducted pursuant to § 232.205 to ensure 100 percent effective and operative brakes. The inbound inspection required by paragraph (a)(6) of this section may be used to meet this requirement provided it encompasses all the inspection elements contained in § 232.205.

(ii) If the train will move greater than 1,000 miles from that location without another brake inspection, the train must be identified as an extended haul train for that movement and shall meet all the requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(7) of this section. Such trains shall receive a Class I brake test pursuant to § 232.205 by a qualified mechanical inspector to ensure 100 percent effective and operative brakes, a freight car inspection pursuant to part 215 of this chapter by an inspector designated under § 215.11 of this chapter, and all cars containing non-complying conditions under part 215 of this chapter shall either be repaired or removed from the train. The inbound inspection required by paragraph (a)(6) of this section may be used to meet these inspection requirements provided it encompasses all the inspection elements contained paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(4) of this section.

(7) FRA inspectors shall have physical access to visually observe all brake and freight car inspections and tests required by this section.

(b) Failure to comply with any of the requirements contained in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered an improper movement of a designated priority train for which appropriate civil penalties may be assessed as outlined in appendix A to this part. Furthermore, FRA's Associate Administrator for Safety may revoke a railroad's ability to designate any or all trains as extended haul trains for repeated or willful noncompliance with any of the requirements contained in this section. Such a determination will be made in writing and will state the basis for such action.
