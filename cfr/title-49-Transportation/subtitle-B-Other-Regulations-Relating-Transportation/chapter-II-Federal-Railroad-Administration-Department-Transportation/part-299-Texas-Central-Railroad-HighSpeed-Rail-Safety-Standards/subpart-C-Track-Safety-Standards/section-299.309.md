(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, if a segment of track does not meet all of the requirements for its intended Class, it is to be reclassified to the next lower track Class for which it does meet all of the requirements of this part. However, if the segment of track does not at least meet the requirements for track Class H1 track, operations may continue at Class H1 speeds for a period of not more than 30 days without bringing the track into compliance, under the authority of an individual designated under § 299.353, after that individual determines that operations may safely continue and subject to any limiting conditions specified by such individual.

(c) If a segment of track designated as track Class H0 does not meet all of the requirements for its intended class, operations may continue at Class H0 speeds for a period of not more than 30 days without bringing the track into compliance, under the authority of an individual designated under § 299.353, after that individual determines that operations may safely continue and subject to any limiting conditions specified by such individual.

(d) No high-speed passenger trainset shall operate over track Class H0.
