##### ยง 230.112 Wheels and tires. #####

(a) *Mounting.* Wheels shall be securely mounted on axles. Prick punching or shimming the wheel fit will not be permitted. The diameter of wheels on the same axle shall not vary more than3/32 inch.

(b) *Gage.* Wheels used on standard gage track will be out of gage if the inside gage of flanges, measured on base line is less than 53 inches or more than 533/8 inches. Wheels used on less than standard gage track will be out of gage if the inside gage of flanges, measured on base line, is less than the relevant track gage less 31/2 inches or more than the relevant track gage less 31/8 inches.

(c) *Flange distance variance.* The distance back to back of flanges of wheels mounted on the same axle shall not vary more than1/4 inch.

(d) *Tire thickness.* Wheels may not have tires with a minimum thickness less than that indicated in the table in this paragraph (d). When retaining rings are used, measurements of tires to be taken from the outside circumference of the ring, and the minimum thickness of tires may be as much below the limits specified earlier in this paragraph (d) as the tires extend between the retaining rings, provided it does not reduce the thickness of the tire to less than 11/8 inches from the throat of flange to the counterbore for the retaining rings. The required minimum thickness for tires, by wheel center diameter and weight per axle, is as follows:

|Weight per axle (weight on drivers divided by number of pairs of driving wheels)|Diameter of wheel center (inches)|Minimum thickness (inches)|
