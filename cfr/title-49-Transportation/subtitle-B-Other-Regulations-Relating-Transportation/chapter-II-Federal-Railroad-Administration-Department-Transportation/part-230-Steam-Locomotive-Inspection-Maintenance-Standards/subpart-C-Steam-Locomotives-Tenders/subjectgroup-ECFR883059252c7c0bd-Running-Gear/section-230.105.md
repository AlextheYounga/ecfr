##### § 230.105 Lateral motion. #####

(a) *Condemning limits.* The total lateral motion or play between the hubs of the wheels and the boxes on any pair of wheels shall not exceed the following limits:

|                                        |          Inches          |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|Engine truck wheels (with swing centers)|            1             |
|Engine truck wheels (with rigid centers)|1<sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub>|
|         Trailing truck wheels          |            1             |
|             Driving wheels             |<sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub> |

(b) *Limits increased.* These limits may be increased on steam locomotives operating on track where the curvature exceeds 20 degrees when it can be shown that conditions require additional lateral motion.

(c) *Non-interference with other parts.* The lateral motion shall in all cases be kept within such limits that the driving wheels, rods, or crank pins will not interfere with other parts of the steam locomotive.
