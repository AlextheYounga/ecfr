(a) Each railroad's program shall include criteria and procedures for implementing this section.

(b) When evaluating a person's motor vehicle driving record, a railroad shall not consider information concerning motor vehicle driving incidents that occurred more than 36 months before the month in which the railroad is making its certification decision and shall only consider information concerning the following types of motor vehicle incidents:

(1) A conviction for, or completed state action to cancel, revoke, suspend, or deny a motor vehicle drivers license for, operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or a controlled substance;

(2) A conviction for, or completed state action to cancel, revoke, suspend, or deny a motor vehicle driver's license for, refusal to undergo such testing as is required by State law when a law enforcement official seeks to determine whether a person is operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance.

(c) If such an incident is identified,

(1) The railroad shall provide the data to the railroad's EAP Counselor, together with any information concerning the person's railroad service record, and shall refer the person for evaluation to determine if the person has an active substance abuse disorder;

(2) The person shall cooperate in the evaluation and shall provide any requested records of prior counseling or treatment for review exclusively by the EAP Counselor in the context of such evaluation; and

(3) If the person is evaluated as not currently affected by an active substance abuse disorder, the subject data shall not be considered further with respect to certification. However, the railroad shall, on recommendation of the EAP Counselor, condition certification upon participation in any needed aftercare and/or follow-up testing for alcohol or drugs deemed necessary by the EAP Counselor consistent with the technical standards specified in ยง 240.119(d)(3) of this part.

(4) If the person is evaluated as currently affected by an active substance abuse disorder, the person shall not be currently certified and the provisions of ยง 240.119(b) will apply.
