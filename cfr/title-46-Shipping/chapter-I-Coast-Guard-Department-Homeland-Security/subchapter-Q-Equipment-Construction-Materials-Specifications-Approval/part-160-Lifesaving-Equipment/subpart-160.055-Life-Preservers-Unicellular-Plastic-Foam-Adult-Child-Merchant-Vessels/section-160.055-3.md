(a) *General.* All components used in the construction of life preservers must meet the applicable requirements of subpart 164.019 of this chapter. The requirements for materials specified in this section are minimum requirements, and consideration will be given to the use of alternate materials in lieu of those specified. Detailed technical data and samples of all proposed alternate materials must be submitted for approval before those materials are incorporated in the finished product.

(b) *Unicellular plastic foam.* The unicellular plastic foam shall be all new material complying with the requirements of Subpart 164.015 of this chapter for Type A foam.

(c) *Envelope.* The life preserver envelope, or cover, shall be made of cotton drill. The color shall be Indian Orange, Cable No. 70072, Standard Color Card of America, issued by the Textile Color Association of the United States, Inc., 200 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y., or Scarlet Munsell 7.5 Red 6/10. The drill shall be evenly dyed, and the fastness of the color to laundering, water, crocking, and light shall be rated “good” when tested in accordance with Federal Test Method Standard No. 191, Methods 5610, 5630, 5650, and 5660. After dyeing, the drill shall be treated with a mildew-inhibitor of the type specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The finished goods shall contain not more than 2 percent residual sizing or other nonfibrous material, shall weigh not less than 6.5 ounces per square yard, shall have a thread count of not less than 74 in the warp and 56 in the filling, and shall have a breaking strength (grab method) of not less than 105 pounds in the warp and 70 pounds in the filling. Properly mildew-inhibited drills meeting the physical requirements of Federal Specification CCC-C-426 for Type I, Class 3 drill will be acceptable. If it is proposed to treat the fabric with a fire-retardant substance, full details shall be submitted to the Commandant for determination as to what samples will be needed for testing.

(d) *Thread.* Each thread must meet the requirements of subpart 164.023 of this chapter. Only one kind of thread may be used in each seam.

(e) *Mildew-inhibitor.* The mildew-inhibitor shall be dihydroxydichloro-diphenylmethane, known commercially as Compound G-4, applied by the aqueous method. The amount of inhibitor deposited shall be not more than 1.50 percent and not less than 1 percent of the dry weight of the finished goods.

(f) *Adhesive.* The adhesive shall be an all-purpose waterproof vinyl type. (Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co. EC-870 or EC-1070, United States Rubber Co. M-6256, Herculite Protective Fabrics Corp., CVV, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. R 828, or equal.)

(g) *Reinforcing fabric.* The reinforcing fabric shall be Type III, Class I, laminated vinyl-nylon high strength cloth in accordance with the requirements of Specification MIL-C-43006.

(h) *Webbing.* There are no restrictions as to color, but the fastness of the color to laundering, water, crocking, and light shall be rated “good” when tested in accordance with Federal Test Method Standard No. 191, Methods 5610, 5630, 5650, and 5660. The complete body strap assembly shall have a minimum breaking strength of 360 pounds.

(1) *Nylon webbing.* This webbing shall be 1-inch wide nylon webbing in accordance with the requirements of Specification MIL-W-17337.

(2) *Cotton webbing.* This webbing shall be 1-inch cotton webbing meeting the requirements of Specification MIL-W-530 for Type IIb webbing. This webbing shall be treated with a mildew-inhibitor of the type specified in paragraph (e) of this section.

(i) *Hardware.* All hardware shall be brass, bronze, or stainless steel, and of the approximate size indicated by the drawings. Steel hardware, protected against corrosion by plating, is not acceptable. Snap hook springs shall be phosphor bronze or other suitable corrosion-resistant material. Dee ring, o-ring, slide adjuster and snap hook ends shall be welded or brazed, or they may be a one-piece casting. The complete body strap assembly shall have a minimum breaking strength of 360 pounds.

(j) *Coating.* The coating for the plastic foam shall be a liquid elastomeric vinyl compound. The coating shall be International Orange in color (Color No. 12197 of Federal Standard 595) or Scarlet Munsel 7.5, Red 6/10 and shall meet the following requirements in Table 160.055-3(j):
