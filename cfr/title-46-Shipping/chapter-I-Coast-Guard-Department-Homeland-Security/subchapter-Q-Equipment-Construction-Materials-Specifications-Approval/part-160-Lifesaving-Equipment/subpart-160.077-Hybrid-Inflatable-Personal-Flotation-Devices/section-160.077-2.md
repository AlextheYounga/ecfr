(c) *First quality workmanship* means construction which is free from any defect materially affecting appearance or serviceability.

(d) *Hybrid PFD* means a personal flotation device that has at least one inflation chamber in combination with inherently buoyant material.

(e) *Inflation medium* means any solid, liquid, or gas, that, when activated, provides inflation for buoyancy.

(f) *Inspector* means an independent laboratory representative assigned to perform duties described in § 160.077-23.

(i) [Reserved]

(j) *Reference vest* means a model AK-1, adult PFD; model CKM-1, child medium PFD; or model CKS-2, child small PFD, meeting the requirements of subpart 160.047 of this chapter, except that, in lieu of the weight and displacement values prescribed in Tables 160.047-4(c)(2) and 160.047-4(c)(4), each insert must have the minimum weight of kapok and displacement as shown in Table 160.077-2(j). To achieve the specified volume displacement, front and back insert pad coverings may be larger than the dimensions prescribed by § 160.047-1(b) and the width of the front fabric envelope and height of the back fabric envelope may be increased to accommodate a circumference no greater than 1/4″ larger than the filled insert circumference. As an alternative, unicellular plastic foam inserts of the specified displacement and of an equivalent shape, as accepted by the Commandant, may be substituted for kapok inserts.
