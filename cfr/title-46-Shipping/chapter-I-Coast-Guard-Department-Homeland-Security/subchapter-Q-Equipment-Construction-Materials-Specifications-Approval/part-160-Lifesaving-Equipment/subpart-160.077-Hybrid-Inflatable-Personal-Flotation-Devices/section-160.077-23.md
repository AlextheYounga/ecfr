##### § 160.077-23 Production tests and inspections. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Production tests and inspections must be conducted in accordance with this section and subpart 159.007 of this chapter.

(2) The Commandant may prescribe additional production tests and inspections if needed to maintain quality control and check for compliance with the requirements of this subpart.

(b) *Test and Inspection Responsibilities.* In addition to responsibilities set out in part 159 of this chapter, each manufacturer of a hybrid PFD and each independent laboratory inspector must comply with the following, as applicable:

(1) *Manufacturer.* Each manufacturer must—(i) Perform all required tests and examinations on each PFD lot before the independent laboratory inspector tests and inspects the lot, except as provided in § 160.077-23(d)(5);

(ii) Perform required testing of each incoming lot of inflation chamber material before using that lot in production;

(iii) Have procedures for maintaining quality control of the materials used, manufacturing operations, and the finished product;

(iv) Have a continuing program of employee training and a program for maintaining production and test equipment;

(v) Have an inspector from the independent laboratory observe the production methods used in producing the first PFD lot produced and observe any revisions made thereafter in production methods;

(vi) Admit the inspector and any Coast Guard representative to any place in the factory where work is done on hybrid PFD's or component materials, and where completed PFD's are stored; and

(vii) Allow the inspector and any Coast Guard representative to take samples of completed PFD's or of component materials for tests prescribed in this subpart.

(2) *Independent Laboratory.* (i) An inspector may not perform or supervise any production test or inspection unless—

(A) The manufacturer has a current approval certificate; and

(B) The inspector has first observed the manufacturer's production methods and any revisions to those methods.

(ii) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, an inspector must perform or supervise testing and inspection of at least one PFD lot in each five lots produced.

(iii) During each inspection, the inspector must check for noncompliance with the manufacturer's quality control procedures.

(iv) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, at least once each calendar quarter, the inspector must, as a check on the manufacturer's compliance with this section, examine the manufacturer's records required by § 160.077-25 and observe the manufacturer perform each of the tests required by paragraph (h) of this section.

(v) If less than six lots are produced during any calendar year, only one lot inspection in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, and one records examination and test performance observation in accordance with paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section is required during that year. Each lot tested and inspected must be within seven lots of the previous lot inspected.

(c) *PFD Lots.* A lot number must be assigned to each group of PFD's produced. No lot may exceed 1000 PFD's. A new lot must be started whenever any change in materials or a production method is made, or whenever any substantial discontinuity in the production process occurs. Changes in lots of component materials must be treated as changes in materials. Lots must be numbered serially. The lot number assigned, along with the approval number, must enable the PFD manufacturer, by referring to the records required by this subpart, to determine who produced the components used in the PFD.

(d) *Samples.* (1) Samples used in testing and inspections must be selected at random. Sampling must be done only when all PFD's or materials in the lot are available for selection.

(2) Each sample PFD selected must be complete, unless otherwise specified in paragraph (h) of this section.

(3) Each adult test subject must have a freeboard of at least:

(i) 100 mm (4 inches) if the PFD being tested is to be approved as a Type I hybrid PFD; or

(ii) 120 mm (4.75 inches) if the PFD being tested is to be approved as a SOLAS lifejacket.

(4) The number of samples selected per lot must be at least the number listed in Table 160.077-23A or Table 160.077-23B, as applicable, except as allowed in paragraph (d)(5) of this section.

(5) If the total production for any five consecutive lots does not exceed 250 devices, the manufacturer's and inspector's tests can be run on the same sample(s) at the same time.

(ii) On the samples selected for testing—

(A) The manufacturer must conduct the tests in paragraph (h)(2) through (h)(8) of this section; and

(B) The independent laboratory inspector must conduct or supervise the tests in paragraph (h)(4) through (h)(9) of this section.

(iii) Each individual test result must, in addition to meeting the requirements in this paragraph, comply with the requirements, if any, set out in the approved plans and specifications.

(2) *Inflation Chamber Materials.* Each sample must be tested according to § 160.077-19(d)(1) through § 160.077-19(d)(4). The average and individual results of testing the minimum number of samples prescribed in § 160.077-19(d) must comply with the requirements in § 160.077-11(d)(1).

(3) *Seam Strength.* The seams in each inflation chamber of each sample must be tested according to §§ 160.077-19(d)(1) and 160.077-19(d)(5). The results for each inflation chamber must be at least 90% of the results obtained in approval testing.

(4) *Over-pressure.* Each sample must be tested according to and meet UL 1517, section 28. Test samples may be prestressed by inflating them to a greater pressure than the required test pressure prior to initiating the test at the specified values.

(5) *Air Retention.* Each sample must be tested according to and meet UL 1517, section 36. Prior to initiating the test at the specified values, test samples may be prestressed by inflating to a pressure greater than the design pressure, but not exceeding 50 percent of the required pressure for the tests in paragraph (h)(4) of this section. Any alternate test method that decreases the length of the test must be accepted by the Commandant and must require a proportionately lower allowable pressure loss and the same percentage sensitivity and accuracy as the standard allowable loss measured with the standard instrumentation.

(6) *Buoyancy and Inflation Medium Retention.* Each sample must be tested according to and meet § 160.077-19(b)(6), except that the UL 1517 section 19 test is not required unless specified on the approved plans and specifications.

(ii) An inspector may not perform a final lot inspection unless the manufacturer has a current approval certificate.

(iii) If the inspector rejects a lot, the inspector shall notify the Commandant immediately.

(iv) The inspector must prepare and sign the record required by § 159.077-13 of this chapter and § 160.077-25(b). If the lot passes, the record must also include the inspector's certification to that effect and a certification that no evidence of noncompliance with this section was observed.

(k) *Disposition of PFD's Rejected in Testing or Inspections.* (1) A rejected PFD lot may be resubmitted for testing, examination, or inspection if the manufacturer first removes and destroys each PFD having the same type of defect or, if authorized by the Commandant or an authorized representative of the Commandant, reworks the lot to correct the defect.

(2) Any PFD rejected in a final lot examination or inspection may be resubmitted for examination or inspection if all defects have been corrected and reexamination or reinspection is authorized by the Commandant or an authorized representative of the Commandant.

(3) A rejected lot or rejected PFD may not be sold or offered for sale with the representation that it meets this subpart or that it is Coast Guard approved.
