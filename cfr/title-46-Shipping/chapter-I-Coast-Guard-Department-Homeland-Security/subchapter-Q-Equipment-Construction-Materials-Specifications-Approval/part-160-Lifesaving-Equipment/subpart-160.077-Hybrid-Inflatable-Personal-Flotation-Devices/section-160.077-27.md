There Are Five Types of Personal Flotation Devices

This is a Type [*insert approved Type*] Hybrid Inflatable PFD.

Note:

The following types of PFDs are designed to perform as described in calm water and when the wearer is not wearing any other flotation material (such as a wetsuit).

*Type I*—A Type I PFD has the greatest required inherent buoyancy and turns most unconscious persons in the water from a face down position to a vertical and slightly backward position, therefore greatly increasing one's chances of survival. The Type I PFD is suitable for all waters, especially for cruising on waters where rescue may be slow coming, such as large bodies of water where it is not likely that boats will be nearby. This type PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water. It is reversible and available in only two sizes—Adult (over 40 kg (90 lb)) and child (less than 40 kg (90 lb)) which are universal sizes (designed for all persons in the appropriate category).

*Type II*—A Type II PFD turns most wearers to a vertical and slightly backward position in the water. The turning action of a Type II PFD is less noticeable than the turning action of a Type I PFD and the Type II PFD will not turn as many persons under the same conditions as the Type I. The Type II PFD is usually more comfortable to wear than the Type I. This type of PFD is designed to fit a wide range of people for easy emergency use, and is available in the following sizes: Adult (over 40 kg (90 lb)), Medium Child (23-40 kg (50-90 lb)), and two categories of Small Child (less than 23 kg (50 lb) or less than 14 kg (30 lb). Additionally, some models are sized by chest sizes. You may prefer to use the Type II where there is a good chance of fast rescue, such as areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing and other water activities.

*Type III*—The Type III PFD allows the wearer to tilt backwards in the water, and the device will maintain the wearer in that position and will not turn the wearer face down. It is not designed to turn the wearer face up. A Type III is generally more comfortable than a Type II, comes in a variety of styles which should be matched to the individual use, and is often the best choice for water sports, such as skiing, hunting, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. This type PFD normally comes in many chest sizes and weight ranges; however, some universal sizes are available. You may also prefer to use the Type III where there is a probability of quick rescue such as areas where it is common for other persons to be engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities.

*Hybrid Inflatable Type I, II, or III*—A Type I, II, or III Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which is the most comfortable PFD to wear and has a minimal amount of buoyancy when deflated and significantly increased buoyancy when inflated (See accompanying table for actual buoyancy for your Type of hybrid). When inflated it turns the wearer with the action of a Type I, II, or III PFD as indicated on its label. Boaters taking advantage of the extra comfort of hybrid inflatable PFDs must take additional care in the use of these devices. Boaters should test their hybrid PFDs in the water, under safe, controlled conditions to know how well the devices float them with limited buoyancy. Approximately 90 percent of boaters will float while wearing a Type II or III hybrid inflatable PFD when it is not inflated. However, hybrid inflatable PFDs are not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough additional inflation to float the wearer. Almost all boaters will float while wearing a Type I hybrid inflatable PFD that is not inflated. The PFD's ‘performance type’ indicates whether it should be used only where help is nearby, or if it also may be used where help may be slow coming. Type I hybrids are suitable where rescue may be slow coming, while Types II and III are good only when there is a chance of fast rescue. Type I hybrids are approved in three weight ranges, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); youth, for persons weighing 23-40 kg (50-90 lb); and small child, for persons weighing 14-23 kg (30-50 lb). Type II hybrid PFDs are approved in the same size ranges as Type I hybrids but may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes. Type III hybrids are only approved in adult and youth sizes but may also be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.

*Type IV*—A Type IV PFD is normally thrown or tossed to a person who has fallen overboard so that the person can grasp and hold the device until rescued. Until May 15, 1995 (or May 1, 1996 at commercial liveries), the Type IV is acceptable in place of a wearable device in certain instances. However, this type is suitable only where there is a good chance of quick rescue, such as areas where it is common for other persons to be nearby engaged in boating, fishing, and other water activities. It is not recommended for use by non-swimmers and children.

*Type V (General)*—A Type V PFD is a PFD approved for restricted uses or activities such as boardsailing, or commercial white water rafting. These PFDs are not suitable for other boating activities. The label on the PFD indicates the kinds of activities for which the PFD may be used and whether there are limitations on how it may be used.

*Type V Hybrid*—A Type V Hybrid PFD is an inflatable device which can be the most comfortable and has very little buoyancy when it is not inflated, and considerably more buoyancy when it is inflated. In order for the device to count toward carriage requirements on recreational boats, it must be worn except when the boat is not underway or when the user is below deck. When inflated it turns the wearer similar to the action provided by a Type I, II, or III PFD (the type of performance is indicated on the label). This type of PFD is more comfortable because it is less bulky when it is not inflated. Boaters taking advantage of the extra comfort of hybrid inflatable PFDs must take additional care in the use of these devices. Boaters should test their hybrid PFDs in the water, under safe, controlled conditions to know how well the devices float them with limited buoyancy. Approximately 70 percent of boaters will float while wearing a Type V hybrid PFD when the device is not inflated. Therefore, it is not recommended for non-swimmers unless worn with enough additional inflation to float the wearer. The PFD's “performance type” indicates whether it should be used only where help is nearby, or if it may also be used where help may be slow coming. This type of PFD is approved in two sizes, adult, for persons weighing over 40 kg (90 lb); and youth, for persons weighing 23-40 kg (50-90 lb), and may be available in a number of chest sizes and in universal adult sizes.
