##### § 161.002-6 Testing requirements. #####

(a) Devices must be tested and listed for fire service by an accepted independent laboratory, as accepted in accordance with § 159.010 of this subchapter, or by a NRTL as set forth in 29 CFR 1910.7.

(b) Each fire detection device must comply with the following standards (incorporated by reference, see § 161.002-1) as appropriate:

(1) Control units—UL 864;

(2) Heat detectors—UL 521;

(3) Smoke detectors—UL 268;

(4) Flame detectors—ANSI/FM 3260;

(5) Audible alarms—UL 464 or UL 1480;

(6) Visual alarms—UL 1971; and

(7) Manual Signaling Boxes—UL 38.

(c) All devices must be tested by an accepted independent laboratory, as defined in § 159.010 of this subchapter, to meet the marine environment testing requirements in Table 161.002-6(c) of this section. The test parameters are found in IEC 60092-504 (incorporated by reference, see § 161.002-1).
