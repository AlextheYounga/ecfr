Footnotes:

<sup>1</sup> Where length is used in this table, it means the length measured from end to end over the deck, excluding sheer. This expression means a straight line measurement of the overall length from the foremost part of the vessel to the aftermost part of the vessel, measured parallel to the centerline.

<sup>2</sup> Subchapters E (Load Lines), F (Marine Engineering), J (Electrical Engineering), N (Dangerous Cargoes), S (Subdivision and Stability), and W (Lifesaving Appliances and Arrangements) of this chapter may also be applicable under certain conditions. The provisions of 49 CFR parts 171 through 179 apply whenever packaged hazardous materials are on board vessels (including motorboats), except when specifically exempted by law.

<sup>3</sup> Public nautical schoolships, other than vessels of the Navy and Coast Guard, must meet the requirements of part 167 of subchapter R (Nautical Schools) of this chapter, Civilian nautical schoolships, as defined by 46 U.S.C. 1331, must meet the requirements of subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) and part 168 of subchapter R (Nautical Schools) of this chapter.

<sup>4</sup> Subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) of this chapter covers only those vessels of 100 gross tons or more, subchapter T (Small Passenger Vessels) of this chapter covers only those vessels of less than 100 gross tons, and subchapter K (Small Passenger Vessels) of this chapter covers only those vessels less than 100 gross tons carrying more than 150 passengers or overnight accommodations for more than 49 passengers.

<sup>5</sup> Vessels covered by subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) or I (Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels) of this chapter, where the principal purpose or use of the vessel is not for the carriage of liquid cargo, may be granted a permit to carry a limited amount of flammable or combustible liquid cargo in bulk. The portion of the vessel used for the carriage of the flammable or combustible liquid cargo must meet the requirements of subchapter D (Tank Vessels) in addition to the requirements of subchapter H (Passenger Vessels) or I (Cargo and Miscellaneous Vessels) of this chapter.

<sup>6</sup> Any vessel on an international voyage is subject to the requirements of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 (SOLAS).

<sup>7</sup> The terms “passenger(s)” and “passenger(s)-for-hire” are as defined in 46 U.S.C. 2101(21)(21a). On oceanographic vessels, scientific personnel onboard shall not be deemed to be passengers nor seamen, but for calculations of lifesaving equipment, etc., must be counted as persons.

<sup>8</sup> Boilers and machinery are subject to examination on vessels over 40 feet in length.

<sup>9</sup> Under 46 U.S.C. 441 an oceanographic research vessel “. . . being employed exclusively in instruction in oceanography or limnology, or both, or exclusively in oceanographic research, . . .. Under 46 U.S.C. 443, “an oceanographic research vessel shall not be deemed to be engaged in trade or commerce.” If or when an oceanographic vessel engages in trade or commerce, such vessel cannot operate under its certificate of inspection as an oceanographic vessel, but shall be inspected and certified for the service in which engaged, and the scientific personnel aboard then become persons employed in the business of the vessel.

<sup>10</sup> Bulk dangerous cargoes are cargoes specified in table 151.01-10(b); in table 1 of part 153, and in table 4 of part 154 of this chapter.

<sup>11</sup> For manned tankbarges, see § 151.01-10(c) of this chapter.

<sup>12</sup> See § 151.01-15, 153.900(d), or 154.30 of this chapter as appropriate.
