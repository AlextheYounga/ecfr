(1) As stated in ยง 50.15-5 of this subchapter, section IX of the ASME Code is adopted and shall be the governing requirements for the qualification of all types of welders and brazers, the qualification of all types of welding procedures, and the production tests for all types of manual and machine arc and gas welding and brazing processes used in fabricating power boilers, heating boilers, pressure vessels and piping unless specifically limited, modified or replaced by other regulations in this part.

(b) References to the ASME Code, like paragraph QW-131.1 indicate:

Q = Section IX, Welding and Brazing Qualifications, ASME Code.W = Part containing requirements for welding procedure, welder, and welding operator qualifications.131 = Major division within the part.131.1 = Specific subparagraph within the part.

(c) When a paragraph or a section of the regulations in this part relates to material in section IX of the ASME Code, the relationship with the code will be shown immediately following the heading of the section or at the beginning of the paragraph as follows:

(1) (Modifies Q\_\_\_\_\_\_.) This indicates that the material in Q\_\_\_\_\_\_ is generally applicable but is being altered, amplified or augmented.

(2) (Replaces Q\_\_\_\_\_\_.) This indicates that Q\_\_\_\_\_\_ does not apply.

(3) (Reproduces Q\_\_\_\_\_\_.) This indicates that Q\_\_\_\_\_\_ is being identically reproduced for convenience, not for emphasis.
