##### ยง 56.97-25 Preparation for testing (reproduces 137.2). #####

(a) *Exposure of joints.* All joints including welds must be left uninsulated and exposed for examination during the test.

(b) *Addition of temporary supports.* Piping systems designed for vapor or gas may be provided with additional temporary supports, if necessary, to support the weight of the test liquid.

(c) *Restraint or isolation of expansion joints.* Expansion joints must be provided with temporary restraint, if required for the additional pressure load under test, or they must be isolated from the test.

(d) *Isolation of equipment not subjected to pressure test.* Equipment that is not to be subjected to the pressure test must be either disconnected from the piping subassembly or system or isolated by a blank flange or similar means. Valves may be used if the valve with its closure is suitable for the proposed test pressure.

(e) *Treatment of flanged joints containing blinds.* Flanged joints at which blinds are inserted to blank off other equipment during the test need not be tested.

(f) *Precautions against test medium expansion.* If a pressure test is to be maintained for a period of time and the test medium in the system is subject to thermal expansion, precautions must be taken to avoid excessive pressure. A small relief valve set to 11/3 times the test pressure is recommended during the pressure test.
