(viii) (b) When a section or paragraph of the regulations in this part relates to material in ASME B31.1, the relationship with ASME B31.1 will appear immediately after the heading of the section or at the beginning of the paragraph as follows:

(1) (Modifies \_\_\_\_.) This indicates that the material in ASME B31.1 so numbered for identification is generally applicable but is being altered, amplified, or augmented.

(2) (Replaces \_\_\_\_.) This indicates that the material in ASME B31.1 so numbered for identification does not apply.

(3) (Reproduces \_\_\_\_.) This indicates that the material in ASME B31.1 so numbered for identification is being identically reproduced for convenience, not for emphasis.

(c) As stated in ยง 56.01-2 of this chapter, the standards of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and ASME specifically referred to in this part must be the governing requirements for the matters covered unless specifically limited, modified, or replaced by other rules in this subchapter. See 46 CFR 56.60-1(b) for the other adopted commercial standards applicable to piping systems that also constitute this subchapter.
