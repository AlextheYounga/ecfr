|**Note 1 to table § 53.01-3(a):** The references to specific provisions in Section IV of the ASME BPVC are coded. The first letter, such as “H,” refers to Section IV. The second letter, such as “G,” refers to a part or subpart in Section IV. The number following the letters refers to the numbered paragraph in the text of the part or subpart in Section IV.|                 |

(b) References to the ASME BPVC, such as paragraph HG-307, indicate:

(1) H = Section IV of the ASME BPVC.

(2) G = Part containing general requirements.

(3) 3 = Article in part.

(4) 307 = Paragraph within Article 3.

(c) When a paragraph or a section of the regulations in this part relates to Section IV of the ASME BPVC, the relationship with the code will be shown immediately following the heading of the section or at the beginning of the paragraph, as follows:

(1) (Modifies H\_\_.) This indicates that the material in H\_\_ is generally applicable but is being altered, amplified, or augmented.

(2) (Replaces H\_\_.) This indicates that H\_\_ does not apply.

(3) (Reproduces H\_\_.) This indicates that H\_\_ is being identically reproduced for convenience, not for emphasis.
