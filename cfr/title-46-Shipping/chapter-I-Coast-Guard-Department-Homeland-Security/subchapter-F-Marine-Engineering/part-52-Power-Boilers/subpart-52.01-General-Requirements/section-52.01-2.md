The first letter โPโ refers to section I, while the letter โAโ refers to the appendix to section I. The letter or letters following โPโ refer to a specific subsection of section I. The number following the letter or letters refers to the paragraph so numbered in the text.|                     |

(b) References to the ASME BPVC, such as paragraph PG-1, indicate:

(1) P=Section I, Power Boilers.

(2) G=SubsectionโGeneral Requirements.

(3) 1=Paragraph 1.

(c) When a section or paragraph of the regulations in this part relates to Section I of the ASME BPVC, the relationship with the code will be shown immediately following the heading of the section or at the beginning of the paragraph as follows:

(1) (Modifies P \_\_.) This indicates that the material in P \_\_ is generally applicable but is being altered, amplified, or augmented.

(2) (Replaces P \_\_.) This indicates that P \_\_ does not apply.

(3) (Reproduces P \_\_.) This indicates that P \_\_ is being identically reproduced for convenience, not for emphasis.
