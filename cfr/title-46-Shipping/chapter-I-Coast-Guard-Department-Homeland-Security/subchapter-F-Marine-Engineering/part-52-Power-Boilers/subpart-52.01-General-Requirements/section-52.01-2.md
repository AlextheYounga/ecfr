|**Note 1 to table 1 to § 52.01-2(a):** The references to specific provisions in the ASME BPVC are coded. The first letter “P” refers to section I, while the letter “A” refers to the appendix to section I. The letter or letters following “P” refer to a specific subsection of section I. The number following the letter or letters refers to the paragraph so numbered in the text.|                     |

(b) References to the ASME BPVC, such as paragraph PG-1, indicate:

(1) P=Section I, Power Boilers.

(2) G=Subsection—General Requirements.

(3) 1=Paragraph 1.

(c) When a section or paragraph of the regulations in this part relates to Section I of the ASME BPVC, the relationship with the code will be shown immediately following the heading of the section or at the beginning of the paragraph as follows:

(1) (Modifies P \_\_.) This indicates that the material in P \_\_ is generally applicable but is being altered, amplified, or augmented.

(2) (Replaces P \_\_.) This indicates that P \_\_ does not apply.

(3) (Reproduces P \_\_.) This indicates that P \_\_ is being identically reproduced for convenience, not for emphasis.
