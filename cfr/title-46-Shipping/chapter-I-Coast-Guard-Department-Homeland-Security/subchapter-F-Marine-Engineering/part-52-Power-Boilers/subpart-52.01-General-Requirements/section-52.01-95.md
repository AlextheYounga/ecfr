##### § 52.01-95 Design (modifies PG-16 through PG-31 and PG-100). #####

(a) *Requirements.* Boilers required to be designed to this part shall meet the requirements of PG-16 through PG-31 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 52.01-1) except as noted otherwise in this section.

(b) *Superheater.* (1) The design pressure of a superheater integral with the boiler shall not be less than the lowest setting of the drum safety valve.

(2) Controls shall be provided to insure that the maximum temperature at the superheater outlets does not exceed the allowable temperature limit of the material used in the superheater outlet, in the steam piping, and in the associated machinery under all operating conditions including boiler overload. Controls need not be provided if the operating superheater characteristic is demonstrated to be such that the temperature limits of the material will not be exceeded. Visible and audible alarms indicating excessive superheat shall be provided in any installation in which the superheater outlet temperature exceeds 454 °C (850 °F). The setting of the excessive superheat alarms must not exceed the maximum allowable temperature of the superheater outlet, which may be limited by the boiler design, the main steam piping design, or the temperature limits of other equipment subjected to the temperature of the steam.

(3) Arrangement shall be made for venting and draining the superheater in order to permit steam circulation through the superheater when starting the boiler.

(c) *Economizer.* The design pressure of an economizer integral with the boiler and connected to the boiler drum without intervening stop valves shall be at least equal to 110 percent of the highest setting of the safety valves on the drum.

(d) *Brazed boiler steam air heaters.* Boiler steam air heaters utilizing brazed construction are permitted at temperature not exceeding 525 °F. Refer to § 56.30-30(b)(1) of this subchapter for applicable requirements.

(e) *Stresses.* (*Modifies PG-22.*) The stresses due to hydrostatic head shall be taken into account in determining the minimum thickness of the shell or head of any boiler pressure part unless noted otherwise. Additional stresses, imposed by effects other than internal pressure or static head, which increase the average stress over substantial sections of the shell or head by more than 10 percent of the allowable stress shall be taken into account. These effects include the weight of the vessel and its contents, method of support, impact loads, superimposed loads, localized stresses due to the reactions of supports, stresses due to temperature gradients and dynamic effects.

(f) *Cylindrical components under internal pressure.* (*Modifies PG-27.*) The minimum required thickness and maximum allowable working pressure of boiler piping, tubes, drums and headers shall be as required by the formula in PG-27 of section I of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code except that threaded boiler tubes are not permitted.
