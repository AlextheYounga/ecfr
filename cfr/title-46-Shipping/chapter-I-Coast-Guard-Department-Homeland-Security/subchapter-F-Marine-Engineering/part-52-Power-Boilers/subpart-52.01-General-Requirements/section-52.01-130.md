##### ยง 52.01-130 Installation. #####

(a) *Foundations.* (1) Plans showing details of proposed foundations and support for boilers and the proposed means of bracing boilers in the vessel shall be submitted for approval to the Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, in the district where the installation is being made.

(2) Provision shall be made in foundations for expansion of the boilers when heated.

(3) Boilers shall be provided with chocks to prevent movement in the event of collision unless a bolted or riveted construction satisfactorily provides for this contingency.

(b) *Protection of adjacent structure.* (1) Boilers shall be so placed that all parts are readily accessible for inspection and repair.

(2) In vessels having a double bottom or other extensive surfaces directly below the boiler, the distance between such surface and a boiler shall in no case be less than 18 inches at the lowest part.

(3) In certain types of vessels where the boiler foundation forms the ashpit, such foundations shall be efficiently ventilated, except in cases where the ashpit is partially filled with water at all times.

(4) The pans of oil-burning, watertube boilers shall be arranged to prevent oil from leaking into the bilges and shall be lined with firebrick or other heat resisting material.

(5) The distance between a boiler and a compartment containing fuel oil shall not be less than 24 inches at the back end of a boiler and 18 inches elsewhere, except that for a cylindrical part of a boiler or a knuckle in the casing of a water-tube boiler, these distances may be reduced to 18 inches, provided all parts are readily accessible for inspection and repair.

(6) All oil-burning boilers shall be provided with oiltight drip pans under the burners and elsewhere as necessary to prevent oil draining into the bilges.

(c) *Boiler uptakes.* (1) Where dampers are installed in the uptakes or funnels, the arrangement shall be such that it will not be possible to shut off the gas passages from the operating boilers.

(2) Each main power boiler and auxiliary boiler shall be fitted with a separate gas passage.
