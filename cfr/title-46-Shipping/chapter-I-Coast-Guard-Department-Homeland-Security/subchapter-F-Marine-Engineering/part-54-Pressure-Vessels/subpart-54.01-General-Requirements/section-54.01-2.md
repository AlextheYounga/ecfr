|<sup>1</sup> The references to specific provisions in section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code are coded. The first letter, such as “U,” refers to division 1 of section VIII. The second letter, such as “G,” refers to a subsection within section VIII. The number refers to the paragraph within the subsection.|                               |

(b) References to the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, such as paragraph UG-125, indicate:

U = Division 1 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

G = Part containing general requirements.

125 = Paragraph within part.

(c) When a paragraph or a section of the regulations in this part relates to material in section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, the relationship with the code will be shown immediately following the heading of the section or at the beginning of the paragraph, as follows:

(1) (Modifies U\_\_\_\_\_\_.) This indicates that the material in U\_\_\_\_\_\_ is generally applicable but is being altered, amplified or augmented.

(2) (Replaces U\_\_\_\_\_\_.) This indicates that U\_\_\_\_\_\_ does not apply.

(3) (Reproduces U\_\_\_\_\_\_.) This indicates that U\_\_\_\_\_\_ is being identically reproduced for convenience, not for emphasis.
