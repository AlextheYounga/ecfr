##### § 62.25-30 Environmental design standards. #####

(a) All automation must be suitable for the marine environment and must be designed and constructed to operate indefinitely under the following conditions:

(1) Ship motion and vibration described in Table 9 of section 4-9-7 of the ABS Steel Vessel Rules (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 62.05-1); note that inclination requirements for fire and flooding safety systems are described in 46 CFR 112.05-5(c).

(2) Ambient air temperatures described in Table 9 of part 4-9-7 of the ABS Steel Vessel Rules.

(3) Electrical voltage and frequency tolerances described in Table 9 of part 4-9-7 of the ABS Steel Vessel Rules.

(4) Relative humidity of 0 to 95% at 45 °C.

(5) Hydraulic and pneumatic pressure variations described in Table 9 of part 4-9-7 of the ABS Steel Vessel Rules.

Note:

Considerations should include normal dynamic conditions that might exceed these values, such as switching, valve closure, power supply transfer, starting, and shutdown.

(b) Low voltage electronics must be designed with due consideration for static discharge, electromagnetic interference, voltage transients, fungal growth, and contact corrosion.
