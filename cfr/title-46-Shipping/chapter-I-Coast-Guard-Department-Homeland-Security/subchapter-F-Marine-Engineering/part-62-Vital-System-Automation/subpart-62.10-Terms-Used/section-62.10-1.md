##### § 62.10-1 Definitions. #####

(a) For the purpose of this part:

*Alarm* means an audible and visual indication of a hazardous or potentially hazardous condition that requires attention.

*Automated* means the use of automatic or remote control, instrumentation, or alarms.

*Automatic control* means self-regulating in attaining or carrying out an operator-specified equipment response or sequence.

*Boiler low-low water level* is the minimum safe level in the boiler, in no case lower than that visible in the gage glass (see § 52.01-110 of this chapter, Water Level Indicators).

*Engineering Control Center (ECC)* means the centralized engineering control, monitoring, and communications location.

*Failsafe* means that upon failure or malfunction of a component, subsystem, or system, the output automatically reverts to a pre-determined design state of least critical consequence. Typical failsafe states are listed in Table 62.10-1(a).

|    System or component     |      Preferred failsafe state       |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|    Cooling water valve     |           As is or open.            |
|        Alarm system        |             Annunciate.             |
|       Safety system        |Shut down, limited, or as is & alarm.|
|        Burner valve        |               Closed.               |
|  Propulsion speed control  |               As is.                |
|      Feedwater valve       |           As is or open.            |
|Controllable pitch propeller|               As is.                |
|   Propulsion safety trip   |           As is & alarm.            |
|      Fuel tank valve       |         See § 56.50-60(d).          |

*Flooding safety* refers to flooding detection, watertight integrity, and dewatering systems.

*Independent* refers to equipment arranged to perform its required function regardless of the state of operation, or failure, of other equipment.

*Limit control* means a function of an automatic control system to restrict operation to a specified operating range or sequence without stopping the machinery.

*Local control* means operator control from a location where the equipment and its output can be directly manipulated and observed, e.g., at the switchboard, motor controller, propulsion engine, or other equipment.

*Manual control* means operation by direct or power-assisted operator intervention.

*Monitor* means the use of direct observation, instrumentation, alarms, or a combination of these to determine equipment operation.

*Remote control* means non-local automatic or manual control.

*Safety trip control system* means a manually or automatically operated system that rapidly shuts down another system or subsystem.

*System* means a grouping or arrangement of elements that interact to perform a specific function and typically includes the following, as applicable:

A fuel or power source.

Power conversion elements.

Control elements.

Power transmission elements.

Instrumentation.

Safety control elements.

Conditioning elements.

*Vital system or equipment* is essential to the safety of the vessel, its passengers and crew. This typically includes, but is not limited to, the following:

Fire detection, alarm, and extinguishing systems.

Flooding safety systems.

Ship service and emergency electrical generators, switchgear, and motor control circuits serving vital electrical loads.

The emergency equipment and systems listed in § 112.15 of this chapter.

Propulsion systems, including those provided to meet § 58.01-35.

Steering systems.
