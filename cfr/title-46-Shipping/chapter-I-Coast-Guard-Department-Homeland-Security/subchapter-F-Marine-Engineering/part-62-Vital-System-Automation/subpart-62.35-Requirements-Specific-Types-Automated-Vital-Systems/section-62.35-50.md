##### § 62.35-50 Tabulated monitoring and safety control requirements for specific systems. #####

The minimum instrumentation, alarms, and safety controls required for specific types of systems are listed in table 1 to § 62.35-50. The ABS Marine Vessel Rules (incorporated by reference; see § 62.05-2) required for engineering systems are also listed in table 1 to § 62.35-50.

(a) Safety limit controls must be provided in navigating bridge primary propulsion control systems. See § 62.35-5(c).

(b) Safety trip controls and alarms must be provided for all main boilers, regardless of mode of operation. See § 62.35-20(a).

(c) Loss of forced lubrication safety trip controls must be provided for main propulsion turbines and main propulsion diesel engines.

(d) Override of overspeed and loss of forced lubrication pressure safety trip controls must not be provided for main propulsion or generator steam or gas turbines, or diesel engines. See § 62.35-5(e)(2).

(e) Transfer interlocks must be provided for main propulsion systems capable of remote and local control.

(f) Semiconductor controlled rectifiers must have current limit controls.

(g) Interlocks must be provided to prevent the starting of engines or turbines while the jacking or turning gear, if installed, is engaged. See § 62.25-5(a).

(h) Main and remote-control stations, including the navigational bridge, must provide visual and audible alarms in the event of a fire in the main machinery space.

(i) Minimally attended and periodically unattended machinery plants must be provided with a personnel alarm that annunciates on the bridge if not acknowledged by the watch engineer. See § 62.50-20(b)(1).

(j) All automatic controls and alarms must be failsafe to the least critical consequence for the particular system. See § 62.30-1.

(k) The operating or tripped status of vital auxiliary boilers must be indicated at the ECC. See part 63 of this subchapter.
