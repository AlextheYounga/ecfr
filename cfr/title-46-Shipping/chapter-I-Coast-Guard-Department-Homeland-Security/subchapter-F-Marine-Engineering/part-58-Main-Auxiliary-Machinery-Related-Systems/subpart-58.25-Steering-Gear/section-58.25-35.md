##### § 58.25-35 Helm arrangements. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 50178, June 12, 2024.

(a) The arrangement of each steering station, other than in the steering-gear compartment, must be such that the helmsman is abaft the wheel. The rim of the wheel must be plainly marked with arrows and lettering for right and left rudder, or a suitable notice indicating these directions must be posted directly in the helmsman's line of sight.

(b) Each steering wheel must turn clockwise for “right rudder” and counterclockwise for “left rudder.” When the vessel is running ahead, after clockwise movement of the wheel the vessel's heading must change to the right.

(c) If a lever-type control is provided, it must be installed and marked so that its movement clearly indicates both the direction of the rudder's movement and, if followup control is also provided, the amount of the rudder's movement.

(d) Markings in the pilothouse must not interfere with the helmsman's vision, but must be clearly visible at night.

Note:

See § 113.40-10 of this chapter for the arrangement of rudder-angle indicators at steering stations.
