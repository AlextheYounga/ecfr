##### ยง 58.30-5 Design requirements. #####

(a) The requirements of part 56 are also applicable to piping and fittings in fluid power and control systems listed in ยง 58.30-1 of this part, except as modified herein. The designer should consider the additional pressure due to hydraulic shock and should also consider the rate of pressure rise caused by hydraulic shock.

(b) The system shall be so designed that proper functioning of any unit shall not be affected by the back pressure in the system. The design shall be such that malfunctioning of any unit in the system will not render any other connected or emergency system inoperative because of back pressure.

(c) Pneumatic systems with a maximum allowable working pressure in excess of 150 pounds per square inch shall be designed with a surge tank or other acceptable means of pulsation dampening.

(d) Each pneumatic system must minimize the entry of oil into the system and must drain the system of liquids.
