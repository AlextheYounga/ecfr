##### § 63.25-7 Exhaust gas boilers. #####

(a) *Construction.* An auxiliary exhaust gas boiler must meet the applicable construction requirements of part 52 or part 53 of this chapter as determined from § 54.01-5, Table 54.01-5(A) of this chapter.

(b) *Controls.* Each drum type exhaust gas steam boiler must have a feed water control system. The system must automatically supply the required amount of feed water and maintain it at the proper level. For boilers without a fixed water level, the control system must supply the feed water at a rate sufficient to ensure proper heat transfer. The system must adequately fill the boiler when cold.

(c) *Alarms.* When a condition arises which results in inadequate heat transfer, a high temperature alarm or low flow alarm must be activated. An audible alarm must automatically sound, and a visual indicator must indicate when the fluid temperature exceeds the maximum operating temperature or when the fluid/steam flowing through the heat exchanger is insufficient to ensure proper heat transfer. Additionally, an audible alarm must automatically sound, and a visual indicator must indicate when a soot fire is present in the exhaust gas boiler's uptake.
