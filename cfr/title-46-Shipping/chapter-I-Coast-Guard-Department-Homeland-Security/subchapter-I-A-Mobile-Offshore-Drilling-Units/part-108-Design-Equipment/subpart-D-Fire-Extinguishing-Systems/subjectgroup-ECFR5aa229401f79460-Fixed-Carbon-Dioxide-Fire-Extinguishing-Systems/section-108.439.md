##### ยง 108.439 Quantity of CO2 for protection of spaces. #####

(a) The number of pounds of CO2 required to protect a space must be equal to the gross volume of the space divided by the appropriate factor from Table 108.439.

(b) If a machinery space includes a casing, the gross volume of the space may be calculated using the reductions allowed in 46 CFR 95.10-5(e).

(c) If fuel can drain from a space to an adjacent space or if two spaces are not entirely separate, the requirements for both spaces must be used to determine the amount of CO2 to be provided and the CO2 system must be arranged to discharge into both spaces simultaneously.
