(2) No material of Class 5.1, in either packaged or bulk solid form, may be stowed above or below a cargo of coal; and

(3) Coal must be separated longitudinally by an intervening complete cargo compartment or hold from materials of Class 1 other than Class/division 1.4.

(c) When transporting direct reduced iron (DRI)—

(1) DRI lumps, pellets, or cold-molded briquettes, and DRI hot-molded briquettes, must be separated from materials of Class/division 1.4, Classes 2, 3, 4, 5, Class 8 acids in packaged form, and bulk solid materials of Classes 4 and 5.1; and

(2) No material of Class 1, other than Class/division 1.4, may be transported on the same vessel with DRI.

(d) Petroleum coke, calcined or uncalcined, must be—
