1. When a ship departs from a port situated on a river or inland waters, deeper loading shall be permitted corresponding to the weight of fuel and all other materials required for consumption between the point of departure and the sea.

2. When a ship is in fresh water of unit density, the appropriate load line may be submerged by the amount of the fresh water allowance shown above. Where the density is other than unity, an allowance shall be made proportional to the difference between 1.025 and the actual density.

3. It is the owner's responsibility to furnish the master with information and instructions for loading and ballasting this vessel to provide guidance as to stability of the vessel under varying conditions of service and to avoid unacceptable stresses in the vessel's structure.

1 The issuing authority is authorized to delete or change words whenever it is inapplicable to a specific vessel and to arrange wording so appropriate word insertions may be made, which accurately describe the facts.

2 At the expiration of this certificate, applicable reissuance should be obtained in accordance with the Load Line Regulations.

4. The Winter North Atlantic Load Line applies only to vessels of 328 feet in length or less, which enter any part of the North Atlantic Ocean during the winter months as defined by the Load Line Regulations in 46 CFR 42.30-5 and 42.30-35. The periods during which the other seasonal load lines apply in different parts of the world are as stated in the Load Line Regulations in 46 CFR 42.30-5 to 42.30-30, inclusive.

5. The Load Line Certificate will be canceled by the Commandant, U.S. Coast Guard, if:

(a) The annual surveys have not been carried out within 3 months either way of each anniversary of the certificate date.

(b) The certificate is not endorsed to show that the ship has been surveyed as indicated in (a).

(c) Material alterations have been made to the hull or superstructure of the vessel, such as would necessitate the assignment of an increased freeboard.

(d) The fittings and appliances for the protection of the openings, guardrails, freeing ports, or the means of access to the crew's quarters have not been maintained in as effective a condition as they were when the certificate was issued.

(e) The structural strength of the ship is lowered to such an extent that the ship is unsafe.

6. When this certificate has expired or has been canceled, it must be delivered to the issuing authority.

(c) The text and arrangement of the printed portion of Form *A2* shall be identical with the information on the face and reverse sides of Form *A1* certificate in paragraph (b) of this section except for the identification of model form, description of the “Freeboard from deck line,” the “Load Line,” and the illustration of load line marks, which shall be as follows:
