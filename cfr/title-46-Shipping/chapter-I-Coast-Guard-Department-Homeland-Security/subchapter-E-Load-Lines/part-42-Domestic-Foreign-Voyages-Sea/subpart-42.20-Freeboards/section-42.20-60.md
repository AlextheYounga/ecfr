##### § 42.20-60 Deduction for superstructures and trunks. #####

(a) Where the effective length of superstructures and trunks is 1.0*L,* the deduction from the freeboard shall be 14 inches at 79 feet length of vessel, 34 inches at 279 feet length, and 42 inches at 400 feet length and above; deductions at intermediate lengths shall be obtained by linear interpolation.

(b) Where the total effective length of superstructures and trunks is less than 1.0*L* the deduction shall be a percentage obtained from table 42.20-60(b)(1) or table 42.20-60(b)(2):

(c) For vessels of Type “B”:

(1) Where the effective length of a bridge is less than 0.2*L,* the percentages shall be obtained by linear interpolation between lines I and II;

(2) Where the effective length of a forecastle is more than 0.4*L,* the percentages shall be obtained from line II; and,

(3) Where the effective length of a forecastle is less than 0.07*L,* the percentages in table 42.20-60(b)(2) of this paragraph shall be reduced by:

5(0.07*L*−*f*)/0.07*L**L* is the length of vessel as defined in § 42.13-15(a), *f* is the effective length of the forecastle.[CGFR 68-60, 33 FR 10065, July 12, 1968, as amended by CGFR 68-126, 34 FR 9015, June 5, 1969; USCG-2014-0688, 79 FR 58280, Sept. 29, 2014]
