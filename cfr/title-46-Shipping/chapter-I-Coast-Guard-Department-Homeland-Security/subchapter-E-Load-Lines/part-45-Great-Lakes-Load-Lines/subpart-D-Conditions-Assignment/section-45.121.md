##### ยง 45.121 Freeing port area: Changes for trunks and side coamings. #####

If a vessel has a trunk and does not meet the requirements of ยง 45.61 or has continuous or substantially continuous hatchway side coamings between detached superstructures, the minimum area of the freeing port openings must be obtained from the following table:

|Breadth of hatchway or trunk in relation to the breadth of ship|Area of freeing ports in relation to the total area of the bulwarks (percent)|
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                      40 percent or less                       |                                     20                                      |
|                      75 percent or more                       |                                     10                                      |

The area of freeing ports at intermediate breadths must be obtained by linear interpolation.
