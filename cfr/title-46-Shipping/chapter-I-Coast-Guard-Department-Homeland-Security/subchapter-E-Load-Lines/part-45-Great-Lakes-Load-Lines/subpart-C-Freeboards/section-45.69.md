##### § 45.69 Correction for bow height. #####

(a) The minimum summer freeboard of all manned vessels must be increased by the same amount in inches as any deficiency which may be shown by the following formulas:

(1) For vessels having a length of not less than 79 feet and not greater than 550 feet,

0.593 *L* (1.0-*L*/1640) inches—actual bow height

(2) For vessels having a length greater than 550 feet,

(341.6—0.227 L) inches—actual bow height

(b) Where the bow height is obtained by sheer, the sheer must extend for at least 15 percent of the length of the vessel measured from the forward perpendicular.

(c) Where the bow height is obtained by a superstructure, the superstructure must be enclosed and extend from the stem to a point at least 0.06 *L* abaft the forward perpendicular.

(d) Vessels which, to suit exceptional operational requirements, cannot meet the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section may be given special consideration by the Commandant.

(e) The bow height is defined as the vertical distance at the forward perpendicular between the waterline corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard at the designed trim and the top of the exposed deck at side.
