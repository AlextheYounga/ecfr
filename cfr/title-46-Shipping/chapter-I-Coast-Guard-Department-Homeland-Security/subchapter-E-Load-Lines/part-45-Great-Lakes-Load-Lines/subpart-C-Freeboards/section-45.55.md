##### § 45.55 Freeboard coefficient. #####

(a) For ships less than 350 feet in length (*L*), the freeboard coefficient is *P*1 in the formula:

*P*1=*P* + *A*[(*L*/*D*)-(*L*/*D*s)]where *P* is a factor, which is a function of the length from table 1 and “A” is a coefficient, which is a function of length (L), from table 2; *L*/*D* is the ratio of the length (*L*) to the depth for freeboard (*D*); *L*/*D*s is the ratio of the length (*L*) to a standard depth (*D*s) from table 3.

*D* is not to be used as less than that which will give a ration of *L* to *D* that is:

(a) More than 15 when *L* = 400 feet or less, or

(b) More than 21 when *L* = 700 feet or more, with the ratio for intermediate lengths being calculated proportionately.

(b) For ships 350 feet or more in length (*L),* the coefficient “A” is zero and the formula is:

*P*1=*P*where *P* is a factor, which is a function of length from table (1).
