The owner of a vessel exempt from the requirement for documentation under paragraph (c) of ยง 67.9 must either:

(1) Apply for renewal of the endorsement by complying with paragraph (b) of this section; or

(2) Place the Certificate of Documentation on deposit in accordance with ยง 67.165.

(b) *Renewal application.* The owner of a vessel must apply for renewal of each endorsement by executing an original Notice of Expiration (CG-1280) or Final Notice After Expiration (CG-1280-B) certifying that the information contained in the Certificate of Documentation and any endorsement(s) thereon remains accurate, and that the Certificate has not been lost, mutilated, or wrongfully withheld. The completed CG-1280 or CG-1280-B must be forwarded to the Director, National Vessel Documentation Center.
