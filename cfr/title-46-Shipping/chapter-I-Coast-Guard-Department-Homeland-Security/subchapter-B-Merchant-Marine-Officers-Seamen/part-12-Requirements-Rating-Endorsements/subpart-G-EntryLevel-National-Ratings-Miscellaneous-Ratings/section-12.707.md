##### § 12.707 Student observers. #####

Students in technical schools who are enrolled in courses in marine management, naval architecture, and ship operations, and who present a letter or other documentary evidence that they are enrolled, will be issued an MMC endorsed as “student observer—any department” and may be signed on ships as such. Students holding these endorsements will not take the place of any of the crew, or replace any of the regular required crew.
