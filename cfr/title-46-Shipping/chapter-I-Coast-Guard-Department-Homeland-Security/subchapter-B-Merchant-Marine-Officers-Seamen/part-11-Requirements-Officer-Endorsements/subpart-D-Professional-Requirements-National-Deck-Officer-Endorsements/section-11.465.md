##### § 11.465 Requirements for national endorsements as Mate (Pilot) of Towing Vessels. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 102335, Dec. 17, 2024.

(a) To obtain an endorsement as Mate (Pilot) of Towing Vessels endorsed with a route listed in column 1 of table 1 to paragraph (a) of this section, applicants must complete the service in columns 2 through 5. Mariners holding a License or MMC endorsement as Master of Towing Vessels-Limited wishing to raise of grade to Mate (Pilot) of Towing Vessels must complete the service in columns 5 and 6. An endorsement with a route endorsed in column 1 authorizes service on the subordinate routes listed in column 7 without further endorsement. Time of service requirements as an Apprentice Mate of Towing Vessels may be reduced by an amount equal to the time specified in the approval letter for a completed Coast Guard-approved training program.
