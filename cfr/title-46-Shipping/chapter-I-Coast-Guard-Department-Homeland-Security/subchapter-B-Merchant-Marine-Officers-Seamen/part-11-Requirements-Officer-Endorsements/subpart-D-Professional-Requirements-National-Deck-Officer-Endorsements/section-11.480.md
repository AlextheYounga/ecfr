Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 26592, June 7, 2019.

(a) This section contains the requirements that an applicant must meet to qualify as a radar observer.

(b) If an applicant meets the requirements of this section, one of the following radar observer endorsements will be added to his or her MMC:

(1) Radar observer (unlimited).

(2) Radar observer (inland waters and Gulf Intercoastal waterways (GIWW)).

(3) Radar observer (rivers).

(c) Radar observer (unlimited) is valid on all waters. Radar observer (inland waters and GIWW) is valid only for those waters other than the Great Lakes covered by the Inland Navigational Rules. Radar observer (rivers) is valid only on any river, canal, or similar body of water designated by the OCMI, but not beyond the boundary line.

(d) Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, each applicant for a radar observer endorsement or for renewal of a radar observer endorsement must complete the appropriate course approved by the Coast Guard, receive the appropriate certificate of training, and present the certificate or a copy of the certificate to the Coast Guard in person, by mail, fax, or other electronic means.

(e) A radar observer endorsement issued under this section is valid for 5 years from the date of issuance of the certificate of training from a course approved by the Coast Guard.

(f) A mariner may maintain the validity of a radar observer endorsement by completing a refresher or re-certification course approved for that purpose.

(g) An applicant for renewal of a license or MMC that does not need a radar observer endorsement may renew without meeting the requirements for the endorsement. However, a radar endorsement will not be placed on the MMC unless the mariner submits a course completion certificate or a copy of the certificate from an approved radar course.

(h) An applicant seeking to raise the grade of a license or MMC endorsement or increase its scope, where the increased grade or scope requires a radar observer certificate, may use an expired certificate to fulfill that requirement. However, a radar endorsement will not be placed on the MMC unless the mariner submits a course completion certificate or a copy of the certificate from an approved radar course.
