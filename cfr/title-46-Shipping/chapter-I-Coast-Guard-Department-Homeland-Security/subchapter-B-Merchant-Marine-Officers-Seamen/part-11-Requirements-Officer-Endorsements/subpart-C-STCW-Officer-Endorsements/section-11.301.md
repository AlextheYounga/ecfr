(4) Service accrued onboard vessels with dual tonnages (both domestic and international) will be credited using the international tonnage for the credential sought.

(5) Applicants who cannot meet the requirement for 1 year of sea service within the last 5 years as described in § 11.303(c) of this subpart, will be required to meet the requirements of § 11.303(a) of this subpart.
