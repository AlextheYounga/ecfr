##### § 154.447 Allowable stress. #####

(a) An independent tank type B designed from bodies of revolution must have allowable stresses 3 determined by the following formulae:

3 See Appendix B for stress analyses definitions.

σm≤f σL≤1.5 f σb≤1.5 F σL + σb≤1.5 F σm + σb≤1.5 F where:σm = equivalent primary general membrane stress 4

4 See Appendix A for equivalent stress.

σL = equivalent primary local membrane stress 4σb = equivalent primary bending stress 4f = the lesser of (σB/A) or (σY/B) F = the lesser of (σB/C) or (σY/D) A, B, C, and D = stress factors in Table 2.
