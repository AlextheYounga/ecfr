##### § 154.447 Allowable stress. #####

(a) An independent tank type B designed from bodies of revolution must have allowable stresses3 determined by the following formulae:

3 See Appendix B for stress analyses definitions.

σm≤fσL≤1.5 fσb≤1.5 FσL + σb≤1.5 Fσm + σb≤1.5 Fwhere:σm = equivalent primary general membrane stress4

4 See Appendix A for equivalent stress.

σL = equivalent primary local membrane stress4σb = equivalent primary bending stress4f = the lesser of (σB/A) or (σY/B)F = the lesser of (σB/C) or (σY/D)A, B, C, and D = stress factors in Table 2.
