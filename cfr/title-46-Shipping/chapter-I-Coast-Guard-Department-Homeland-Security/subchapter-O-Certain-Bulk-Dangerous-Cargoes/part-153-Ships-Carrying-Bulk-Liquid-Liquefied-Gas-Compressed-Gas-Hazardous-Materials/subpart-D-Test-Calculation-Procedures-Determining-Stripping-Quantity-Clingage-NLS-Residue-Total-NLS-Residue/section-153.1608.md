##### § 153.1608 Calculation of total NLS residue and clingage NLS residue. #####

(a) The total NLS residue for each tank is calculated by adding the stripping quantity and the clingage NLS residue.

(b) The clingage NLS residue for each tank is calculated using the following formula:

Qclingage = 1.1 × 10−4 Ad + 1.5 × 10−5 Aw + 4.5 × 10−4 L1/2 Abwhere:Ab = Area of the tank bottom added to the area in square meters of tank structural components projected on a horizontal surface Ad = Area of the tank underdecks added to the area in square meters of tank structural components projected on a horizontal surface Aw = Area of the tank walls added to the area in square meters of tank structural components projected on a vertical surface L = Length of tank in meters from fore to aft Qclingage = volume of clingage in cubic metersWhen using the formula in this paragraph, areas that are inclined more than 30° from the horizontal may be assumed to be vertical.Note:

The Commandant (CG-ENG) (telephone number 202-372-1420) has information that may be useful in approximating surface areas of typical structural members for the projected area calculations under § 153.1608(b).
