##### § 178.450 Calculation of drainage area for cockpit and well deck vessels. #####

(a) The drainage area required on a vessel must be computed using the following formula:

For protected waters required drainage = .1 × Basic DrainageFor partially protected waters required drainage = .5 × Basis DrainageFor exposed waters required drainage = Basic Drainagewhere:Basic Drainage area in centimeters2 = 4389.12 × [(Recess Volume × Recess Ratio) + (Weather Deck Volume × Weather Deck Ratio)]; orBasic Drainage area in inch2 = (Recess Volume × Recess Ratio) + (Weather Deck Volume × Weather Deck Ratio)Recess Volume = (BR × DR) − VRBR = average height in centimeters (feet) of the bulwark above the well deck or cockpit deck;DR = total deck area of the cockpit or well deck in the after2/3 of the vessel length (LOD) measured in centimeters2 (feet2).VR = volume of any weather tight structure below the bulwark of the well deck or cockpit deck.Recess Ratio = LR / LCLR = the length of the recess in the after2/3 vessel length (LOD).LC=2/3 vessel length (LOD).Weather Deck Volume = (BD × DD) − VSBD = average height in centimeters (feet) of the bulwark above the weather deck;DD = total deck area of the weather deck adjacent to bulwarks but not in way of the cockpit or well deck in the after2/3 of the vessel length (LOD) measured in centimenters2 (feet2).VS = volume of any weather tight superstructure below the bulwark on the weather deck located within DD.Weather Deck Ratio = LD / LCLD = the length of the weather deck bulwark in the after2/3 of the vessel length (LOD).LC=2/3 vessel length (LOD).

(b) Vessels with bulwarks in the forward part of the vessel shall not form a well with the deckhouse which retains water.
