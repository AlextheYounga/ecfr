##### § 179.220 Location of watertight bulkheads for subdivision. #####

(a) The maximum distance between adjacent main transverse watertight bulkheads on a vessel, required by § 179.212(a) of this part to comply with this section, must not be more than the smaller of the following:

(1) One third of the length of the bulkhead deck; or

(2) The distance given by the following equation:
