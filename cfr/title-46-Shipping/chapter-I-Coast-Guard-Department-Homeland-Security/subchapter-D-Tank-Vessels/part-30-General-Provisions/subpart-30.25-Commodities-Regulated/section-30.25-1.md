Notes:

“#” = The noxious liquid substance status is undetermined—see 46 CFR 153.900(c) for shipping on an oceangoing vessel.

“†” = Marine occupational safety and health regulations for benzene, 46 CFR part 197, subpart C, may apply to this cargo.

“[ ]” = Provisional categorization to which the United States is party.

“@” = The noxious liquid substance category has been assigned by the Coast Guard, in the absence of one assigned by the IMO. The category is based on a GESAMP Hazard Profile or, by analogy, to a closely related product having a noxious liquid substance assigned.

Bolded entries were added from the March 2012 Annex to the 2007 edition of the IBC Code (MEPC 63/23/Add.1), the December 2012 IMO Marine Environmental Protection Committee Circular (MEPC.2/Circ.18), or the December 2013 IMO Marine Environmental Protection Committee Circular (MEPC.2/Circ.19).

“Cat” = Pollution category.

“F” = Flammable (flash point less than or equal to 60 °C (140 °F).

“I” = An “oil” under MARPOL Annex I.

Italicized words are not part of the cargo name, but may be used in addition to the cargo name.

“LFG” = Liquid flammable gas.

“n.o.s.” = Not otherwise specified.

“OS” = An “other substance” considered at present to pose no harm to marine resources, human health, amenities, or other legitimate uses of the sea when discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations.

“see” = A redirection to the preferred, alternative cargo name—for example, in “Diethyl ether, see Ethyl ether,” the pollution category for “diethyl ether” will be found under the preferred, alternative cargo name “ethyl ether.”

“ST” = Ship type, as defined in Chapter 2 of the 2016 International Bulk Chemical Code.

“X,” “Y,” and “Z” = Noxious liquid substance categories under MARPOL Annex II.
