The cargoes listed in table 30.25-1 are flammable or combustible and when transported in bulk must be in vessels certificated under the rules of this subchapter. A mixture or blend of two or more cargoes appearing in table 30.25-1 may be transported under the provisions of this subchapter. A category A, B, or C noxious liquid substance (NLS) cargo, as defined in § 153.2 of this chapter, that is listed in table 30.25-1 and any mixture containing one or more category A, B, or C NLS cargoes listed in table 30.25-1 may be carried in bulk under this subchapter if the vessel is not regulated under part 153 of this chapter. If the vessel is regulated under § 153.1 of this chapter, category A, B, and C NLS cargoes must be carried under part 153, or, as an alternative in the case of category C oil-like NLS, under 33 CFR part 151. Requirements for category D NLS cargoes and mixtures of non-NLS cargoes with category D NLS cargoes are in 33 CFR part 151.

[ ] - A NLS category in brackets indicates that the product is provisionally categorized and that further data are necessary to complete the evaluation of its pollution hazards. Until the hazard evaluation is completed, the pollution category assigned is used.

@ - The NLS category has been assigned by the U.S. Coast Guard, in absence of one assigned by the IMO. The category is based upon a GESAMP Hazard Profile or by analogy to a closely related product having an NLS assigned.

† - The provisions contained in 46 CFR part 197, subpart C, may apply to this cargo.

Abbreviations for Noxious liquid Cargoes:

N.F. - non-flammable (flash point greater than 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) cc).

n.o.s. - not otherwise specified.

ST - Ship type.

Cat - Pollution category.

Words in italic are not part of the cargo name but may be used in addition to the cargo name.

When one entry references another entry by use of the word “see”, and both names are in roman type, either name may be used as the cargo name (e.g., Diethyl ether, see Ethyl ether). However, the referenced entry is preferred.
