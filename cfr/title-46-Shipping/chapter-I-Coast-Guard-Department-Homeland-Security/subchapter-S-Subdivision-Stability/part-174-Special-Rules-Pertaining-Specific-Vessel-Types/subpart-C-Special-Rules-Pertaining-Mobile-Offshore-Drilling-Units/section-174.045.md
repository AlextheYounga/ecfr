##### § 174.045 Intact stability requirements. #####

(a) Each unit must be designed so that the wind heeling moments (Hm) and righting moments calculated for each of its normal operating conditions and severe storm conditions, when plotted on GRAPH 174.045, define areas that satisfy the equation:

Area(A)≥(K) × (Area (B))where—(1) K = 1.4 except that if the unit is a column stabilized unit K = 1.3;(2) Area (A) is the area on GRAPH 174.045 under the righting moment curve between 0 and the second intercept angle or the angle of heel at which downflooding would occur, whichever angle is less; and(3) Area (B) is the area on GRAPH 174.045 under the wind heeling moment curve between 0 and the second intercept angle or the angle of heel at which downflooding of the unit would occur whichever angle is less.

(b) Each righting moment on graph § 174.045 must be positive for all angles greater than 0 and less than the second intercept angle.

(c) For the purposes of this section, openings fitted with the weathertight closing appliances specified in § 174.100(b) are not considered as openings through which downflooding could occur if they can be rapidly closed and would not be submerged below the units' waterline prior to the first intercept angle, except that ventilation intakes and outlets for machinery spaces, crew spaces, and other spaces where ventilation is normally required are considered as openings through which downflooding could occur regardless of location.

(d) Each unit must be designed so that it can be changed from each of its normal operating conditions to a severe storm condition within a minimum period of time consistent with the operating manual required in § 109.121 of this chapter.
