(c) Vessels contracted for prior to July 1, 1935, need not meet the requirements of § 95.10-5(h), and vessels contracted for on or after July 1, 1935, but prior to November 19, 1952, may have a carbon dioxide “bilge” in lieu of “total flooding” system. However, in vessels of both categories where a conversion from coal to oil is contracted for on or after November 19, 1952, the provisions of § 95.10-5(h) shall apply.

(d) The general requirements of § 95.10-5(c) through (g), § 95.10-10(d) through (i), and § 95.10-15 shall be complied with insofar as is reasonable and practicable.
