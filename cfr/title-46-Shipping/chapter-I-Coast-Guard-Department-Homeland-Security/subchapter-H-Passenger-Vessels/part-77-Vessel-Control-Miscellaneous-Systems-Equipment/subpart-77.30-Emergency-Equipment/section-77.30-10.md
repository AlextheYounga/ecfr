(b) If a separate self-contained breathing apparatus is maintained for protection against gas leaking from a refrigeration unit, it must be stowed convenient to, but outside of, the spaces containing the refrigeration equipment.

(c) Half of the remaining equipment set forth in table 77.30-10(a) shall be stowed in or near the pilothouse together with a fire axe and the hand portable fire extinguishers required by table 76.50-10(a) for that location. The other half of the equipment shall be stowed in a convenient accessible location, remote from the pilothouse, and preferably adjacent to the main entrance to the machinery space. Where only one of an item is required, it shall be stowed in the pilothouse.
