(5) Tank vessels constructed before October 1, 1996 engaged in voyages between the continental United States and Alaska or Hawaii, and all other vessels engaged on international voyages which were constructed before July 1, 1986, must meet the requirements of §§ 199.70(b)(4)(i), 199.80, 199.90, 199.100, 199.180, 199.190 (paragraph (b) applies as much as practicable), 199.214, 199.217, 199.250, 199.261 (b)(2) and (e), and 199.273, and must fit retro-reflective material on all floating appliances, lifejackets and immersion suits. Except for the requirements of § 199.261 (b)(2) and (e), vessels may retain the number, type, and arrangement of lifesaving appliances previously required and approved for the vessel as long as the arrangement or appliance is maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the OCMI.

(e) *Passenger vessels.* For the purposes of this part, the following vessels must meet the requirements for passenger vessels:

(1) Passenger vessels.

(2) Special purpose vessels carrying more than 50 special personnel.

(3) Special purpose vessels carrying not more than 50 special personnel if the vessels meet the structural fire protection requirements in subchapter H of this chapter for passenger vessels of the same size.

(f) *Cargo vessels.* For the purposes of this part, the following vessels must meet the requirements for cargo vessels:

(1) Cargo vessels.

(2) Tank vessels.

(3) Special purpose vessels carrying not more than 50 special personnel that do not meet the structural fire protection requirements in subchapter H of this chapter for passenger vessels of the same size.

(g) *Subparts applying to vessels on international and short international voyages.* (1) Passenger vessels on international voyages must meet the requirements of this subpart and subparts B and C of this part.

(2) Cargo vessels on international voyages must meet the requirements of this subpart and subparts B and D of this part.

(3) The provisions for passenger vessels on short international voyages in this subpart and subparts B and C of this part do not apply to special purpose vessels described in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.

(h) *Vessels not subject to SOLAS.* Vessels not on international voyages and vessels listed in paragraph (d) of this section must meet the requirements of this subpart and subparts B, C, D, and E of this part unless otherwise exempted or permitted by subpart F of this part.

(1) Vessels on other than international voyages and vessels listed in paragraph (d) of this section which were constructed prior to October 1, 1996, must—

(i) By October 1, 1999, meet the requirements of §§ 199.70(b)(4)(i), 199.80, 199.90, 199.100, 199.180, 199.190 (paragraph (b) applies as much as practicable), 199.217, 199.250, 199.273, and 199.510, and fit retroreflective material on all floating appliances, lifejackets, and immersion suits;

(ii) By October 1, 2003, passenger vessels must carry the number and type of survival craft specified in table 199.630 of this part and cargo vessels in oceans and coastwise service must carry the number and type of survival craft specified in § 199.261(b)(2) and (e);

(iii) By October 1, 2003, passenger vessels must carry the immersion suits and thermal protective aids specified in § 199.214; and

(iv) Except for the requirements in paragraphs (h)(1)(ii) and (h)(1)(iii) of this section, vessels may retain the number, type, and arrangement of lifesaving equipment, including lifeboats, lifeboat davits, winches, inflatable liferafts, liferaft launching equipment, rescue boats, lifefloats, and buoyant apparatus previously required and approved for the vessel as long as the arrangement or appliance is maintained in good condition to the satisfaction of the OCMI.

(2) This paragraph does not apply to public vessels.

(i) *New lifesaving appliances or arrangements.* When any lifesaving appliance or arrangement on a vessel subject to this part is replaced, or when the vessel undergoes repairs, alterations, or modifications of a major character involving replacement of, or any addition to, the existing lifesaving appliance or arrangements, each new lifesaving appliance and arrangement must meet the requirements of this part, unless the OCMI determines that the vessel cannot accommodate the new appliance or arrangement, except that—

(1) A survival craft is not required to meet the requirements of this part if it is replaced without replacing its davit and winch; and

(2) A davit and its winch are not required to meet the requirements of this part if one or both are replaced without replacing the survival craft.

(j) *Repairs and alterations to lifesaving appliances.* No extensive repairs or alterations, except in an emergency, may be made to a lifesaving appliance without advance notification to the OCMI. Insofar as possible, each repair or alteration must be made with material, and tested in the manner, specified in this subchapter and applicable to the new construction requirements in subchapter Q of this chapter. Emergency repairs or alterations must be reported as soon as practicable to the OCMI responsible for the port or location where the vessel may call after such repairs are made. Lifeboats, rescue boats, or rigid liferafts may not be reconditioned for use on a vessel other than the one they were originally built for, unless specifically accepted by the OCMI.
