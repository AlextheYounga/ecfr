##### ยง 111.05-1 Purpose. #####

This subpart contains requirements for the grounding of electric systems, circuits, and equipment.

Note:

Circuits are grounded to limit excessive voltage from lightning, transient surges, and unintentional contact with higher voltage lines, and to limit the voltage to ground during normal operation. Conductive materials enclosing electric conductors and equipment, or forming part of that equipment, are grounded to prevent a voltage above ground on the enclosure materials.
