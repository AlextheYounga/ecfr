##### § 111.50-3 Protection of conductors. #####

(a) *Purpose.* The purpose of overcurrent protection for conductors is to open the electric circuit if the current reaches a value that will cause an excessive or dangerous temperature in the conductor or conductor insulation. A grounded conductor is protected from overcurrent if a protective device of a suitable rating or setting is in each ungrounded conductor of the same circuit.

(b) *Overcurrent protection of conductors.* Each conductor must be protected in accordance with its current carrying capacity, except a conductor for the following circuits which must meet the following listed subparts of this chapter:

(1) Propulsion circuits, Subpart 111.35.

(2) Steering circuits, subchapter F of this chapter.

(3) Motor circuits, Subpart 111.70.

(4) Flexible cord and fixture wire for lighting circuits, Subpart 111.75.

(5) Switchboard circuits, Subpart 111.30.

(c) *Fuses and circuitbreakers.* If the allowable current-carrying capacity of the conductor does not correspond to a standard rating for fuses or circuitbreakers that meets Section 240.6 of NFPA NEC 2002 or IEC 60092-202 (both incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1), then the next larger such rating is acceptable, except that:

(1) This rating must not be larger than 150 percent of the current-carrying capacity of the conductor; and

(2) The effect of temperature on the operation of fuses and thermally controlled circuitbreakers must be taken into consideration.

(d) *Parallel overcurrent protective devices.* An overcurrent protective device must not be connected in parallel with another overcurrent protective device.

(e) *Thermal devices.* No thermal cutout, thermal relay, or other device not designed to open a short circuit may be used for protection of a conductor against overcurrent due to a short circuit or ground, except in a motor circuit as described in Article 430 of NFPA NEC 2002 or in IEC 60092-202.

(f) *Ungrounded conductors.* A fuse or overcurrent trip unit of a circuit breaker must be in each ungrounded conductor. A branch switch or circuit breaker must open all conductors of the circuit, except grounded conductors.

(g) *Grounded conductor.* An overcurrent device must not be in a permanently grounded conductor, except:

(1) An overcurrent device that simultaneously opens all conductors of the circuit, unless prohibited by § 111.05-17 for the bus-tie feeder connecting the emergency and main switchboards; and

(2) For motor-running protection described in Article 430 of NFPA NEC 2002 or in IEC 60092-202.
