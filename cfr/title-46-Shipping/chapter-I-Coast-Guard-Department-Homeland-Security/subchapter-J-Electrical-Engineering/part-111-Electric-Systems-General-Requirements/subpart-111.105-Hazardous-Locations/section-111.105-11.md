##### § 111.105-11 Intrinsically safe systems. #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 16366, Mar. 16, 2023.

(a) Each system required by this subpart to be intrinsically safe must use approved components meeting UL 913 or IEC 60079-11 (both incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1).

(b) Each electric cable of an intrinsically safe system must—

(1) Be 50 mm (2 inches) or more from cable of non-intrinsically safe circuits, partitioned by a grounded metal barrier from other non-intrinsically safe electric cables, or a shielded or metallic armored cable; and

(2) Not contain conductors for non-intrinsically safe systems.

(c) As part of plan approval, the manufacturer must provide appropriate installation instructions and restrictions on approved system components. Typical instructions and restrictions include information addressing—

(1) Voltage limitations;

(2) Allowable cable parameters;

(3) Maximum length of cable permitted;

(4) Ability of system to accept passive devices;

(5) Acceptability of interconnections with conductors or other equipment for other intrinsically safe circuits; and

(6) Information regarding any instructions or restrictions which were a condition of approval of the system or its components.

(d) Each intrinsically safe system must meet ISA RP 12.6 (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 110.10-1), except Appendix A.1.
