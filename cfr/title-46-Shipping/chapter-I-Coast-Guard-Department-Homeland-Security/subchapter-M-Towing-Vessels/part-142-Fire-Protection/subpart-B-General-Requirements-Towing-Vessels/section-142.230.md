##### § 142.230 Hand-portable fire extinguishers and semi-portable fire-extinguishing systems. #####

(a) Hand-portable fire extinguishers and semi-portable fire-extinguishing systems are classified by a combination letter and Roman numeral. The letter indicates the type of fire which the unit could be expected to extinguish, and the Roman numeral indicates the relative size of the unit.

(b) For the purpose of this subchapter, all required hand-portable fire extinguishers and semi-portable fire-extinguishing systems must include Type B classification, suitable for extinguishing fires involving flammable liquids, grease, etc.

(c) The number designations for size run from “I” for the smallest to “V” for the largest. Sizes I and II are hand-portable fire extinguishers; sizes III, IV, and V are semi-portable fire-extinguishing systems, which must be fitted with hose and nozzle or other practical means to cover all portions of the space involved. Examples of the sizes for some of the typical hand-portable fire extinguishers and semi-portable fire-extinguishing systems appear in Table 142.230(c) of this section.

(i) In addition to the hand-portable extinguishers required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, one Type B-II hand-portable fire extinguisher must be fitted in the engine room for each 1,000 brake horsepower of the main engines or fraction thereof. A towing vessel is not required to carry more than six additional B-II extinguishers in the engine room for this purpose, irrespective of horsepower.

(ii) [Reserved]

(e) The frame or support of any size III, IV, or V semi-portable extinguisher fitted with wheels must be welded or otherwise permanently attached to a steel bulkhead or deck to prevent it from rolling under heavy sea conditions.
