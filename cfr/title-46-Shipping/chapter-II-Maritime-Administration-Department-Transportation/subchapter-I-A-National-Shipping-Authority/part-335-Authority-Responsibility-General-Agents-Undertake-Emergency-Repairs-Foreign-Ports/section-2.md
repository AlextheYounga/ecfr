##### Sec. 2 Stand-by agreements. #####

The Director NSA, Maritime Administration, in advance of an emergency, may negotiate the standard form of terminal operating contract specified in Section 3, with terminal operators on a stand-by basis. Stand-by arrangements establish the framework of rapid initiation of government shipping operations at the outset of an emergency.

At port facilities, (as defined in section 1(e) of 32A CFR part 1901) under the control of the Maritime Administration and allocated for long term exclusive use by the Department of Defense (DOD), provisions will ordinarily be made for the use of contractors under DOD contracts to move DOD cargo through selected ports, to perform such services as pre-stowing, receipt, intransit storage and loading of cargo under DOD procedures for the Defense Transportation System. When it becomes necessary to move DOD cargo through marine terminals under the control of the Maritime Administration, but not allocated for long term exclusive use by DOD, contractors will be required to perform such services as DOD requires for handling cargo and documenting shipments under the Defense Transportation System, with corresponding contractual obligations.
