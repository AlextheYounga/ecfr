While aboard ship, they shall be berthed in single-occupancy rooms or in rooms with other midshipmen in that part of the vessel designated for licensed officers (or in first-class passenger quarters) and shall mess with the licensed officers. The steamship company employers shall also pay the midshipmen such subsistence and room allowance in port, transportation allowances, and other bonuses or allowances as are paid to the licensed officers of the vessel in which the midshipmen are employed.

(d) *Berthing and messing.* While aboard ship, midshipmen shall be berthed in single-occupancy rooms or in rooms with other midshipmen in that part of the vessel designated for licensed officers (or in first-class passenger quarters) and shall mess with the licensed officers.
