(b) In order to qualify as an approved Mortgage Trustee, the Mortgage Trustee must:

(1) Be eligible to hold a Preferred Mortgage on a Fishing Industry Vessel under § 356.19(a)(1) through (a)(5);

(2) Be organized as a corporation and doing business under the laws of the United States or of a State;

(3) Be authorized under the laws of the United States or of the State under which it is organized to exercise corporate trust powers;

(4) Be subject to supervision or examination by an official of the United States Government, or of a State;

(5) Have a combined capital and surplus (as stated in its most recent published report of condition) of at least $3,000,000; and

(6) Meet any other requirements prescribed by the Citizenship Approval Officer.

(c) The Mortgage Trustee must submit to the Citizenship Approval Officer the following documentation in order to be an approved Mortgage Trustee:

(1) An application for approval as a Mortgage Trustee as set out in paragraph (g) of this section;

(2) The appropriate certification and documentation required under § 356.19(b)(1) through (5) to demonstrate that it is qualified to hold a Preferred Mortgage on Fishing Industry Vessels;
