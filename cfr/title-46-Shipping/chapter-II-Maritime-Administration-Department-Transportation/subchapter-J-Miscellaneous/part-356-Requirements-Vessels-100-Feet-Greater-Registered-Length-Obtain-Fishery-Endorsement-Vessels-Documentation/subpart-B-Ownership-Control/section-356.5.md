7. That affiant has carefully examined this affidavit and asserts that all of the statements and representations contained therein are true to the best of his knowledge, information, and belief.

(Name and title of affiant)(Signature of affiant)Date

Penalty for False Statement: A fine or imprisonment, or both, are provided for violation of the proscriptions contained in 18 U.S.C. § 1001 (see also, 18 U.S.C. §§ 286, 287).

(e) The format for an Affidavit of United States Citizenship, modified appropriately for limited liability companies, partnerships, etc., will be available from the Citizenship Approval Officer and on MARAD's internet web site at *http://www.marad.dot.gov.*

(f) The same criteria should be observed in obtaining information to be furnished for stockholders named (direct ownership of required percentage of shares of stock of each class) in the Affidavit as those observed for the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel. If, on the other hand, the “fair inference rule” is applied with respect to stock ownership as outlined in § 356.7(c), the extent of U.S. Citizen ownership of stock should be ascertained in the requisite percentage (65 % for state or federally chartered financial institutions and 95 % for Fishing Industry Vessel owners, bareboat charterers, trustees, as well as entities owning 5% or more of the stock of such entities). Any entity that must establish its U.S. citizenship has to submit proof of U.S. citizenship of any five percent stockholder of each class of stock in order that the veracity of the statutory statements made in the Affidavit (paragraph 5) may be relied upon by MARAD.

(g) It shall be incumbent upon the parties filing affidavits under this part to notify the Citizenship Approval Officer in writing within 30 calendar days of any changes in information last furnished with respect to the officers, directors, and stockholders, including 5 percent or more stockholders of the issued and outstanding stock of each class, together with information concerning their citizenship status. If other than a corporation, comparable information must be filed by other entities owning Fishing Industry Vessel, including any entity whose ownership interest is being relied upon to establish 75% ownership by Citizens of the United States.

(h) If additional material is determined to be essential to clarify or support the evidence of U.S. citizenship, such material shall be furnished by the owner of the Fishing Industry Vessel upon request by the Citizenship Approval Officer.
