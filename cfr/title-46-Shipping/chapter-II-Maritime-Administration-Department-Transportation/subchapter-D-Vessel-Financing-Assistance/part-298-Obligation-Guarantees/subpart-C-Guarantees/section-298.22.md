Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 86612, Dec. 14, 2023.

(a) Generally, after delivery or completion of Shipyard Project, and until maturity of the Obligations, provisions of the Trust Indenture or other part of the Documentation require you to make periodic payment of principal and interest on the Obligations.

(b) Usually, the payment of principal (amortization) shall be made semi-annually, but in no event, less frequently than on an annual basis, and in either case the amortization shall be in equal payments of principal (level principal), unless we consent to the periodic payment of a constant aggregate amount, comprised of both interest and principal components which are variable in amount (level payment). No other proposed method of amortization will be allowed which would reduce the amount of periodic amortization below that determined under the level principal or level payment basis at any time prior to maturity of the Obligations, except where:

(1) You can demonstrate to our satisfaction that there will be adequate funds to discharge the Obligations at maturity;

(2) You establish a fund with the Depository in which you deposit an equal annual amount necessary to redeem the outstanding Obligations at maturity; or

(3) With regard to Eligible Export Vessels, in accordance with such other terms as we determine to be more favorable and to be compatible with export credit terms offered by foreign governments for the sale of vessels built in foreign shipyards.
