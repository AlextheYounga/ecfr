##### ยง 296.24 Subsequent awards of MSP Operating Agreements. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 56897, Dec. 1, 2017.

(a) Until October 1, 2005, if, for any reason, after the award of an MSP Operating Agreement, the Applicant is unwilling or unable to commence operations pursuant to the terms of the MSP Operating Agreement, MARAD may, pursuant to the priority criteria, award that MSP Operating Agreement to an Applicant having an eligible vessel that applied but was not awarded an MSP Operating Agreement.

(b) After October 1, 2005, MARAD intends to ensure that all available MSP Operating Agreements are fully utilized at all times, in order to maximize the benefit of the MSP. Accordingly, when an MSP Operating Agreement becomes available through termination by the Secretary, expiration of a temporary MSP Operating Agreement or early termination by the MSP contractor, and no transfer under 46 U.S.C. 53105(e) is involved, MARAD will reissue the MSP Operating Agreement pursuant to the following criteria.

(1) The proposed vessel must meet the requirements for vessel eligibility in 46 U.S.C. 53102(b);

(2) The applicant must meet the vessel ownership and operating requirements for priority in 46 U.S.C. 53103(c); and

(3) Priority will be assigned in accordance with operational requirements specified by the SecDef.

(c) MARAD will use the following procedures in reissuing an MSP Operating Agreement. MARAD and USTRANSCOM will determine if the applications received on October 15, 2004 form an adequate pool for award of a reissued MSP Operating Agreement. If so, MARAD will award a reissued MSP Operating Agreement from that pool of qualified applicants in its discretion, subject to approval of the SecDef. MARAD and USTRANSCOM may decide to open a new round of applications. Applicants for reissued MSP Operating Agreements must meet the citizenship requirements of Priority III. Inasmuch as MSP furthers a public purpose and MARAD does not acquire goods or services through MSP, the selection process for award of MSP Operating Agreements does not constitute an acquisition process subject to any procurement law or the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
