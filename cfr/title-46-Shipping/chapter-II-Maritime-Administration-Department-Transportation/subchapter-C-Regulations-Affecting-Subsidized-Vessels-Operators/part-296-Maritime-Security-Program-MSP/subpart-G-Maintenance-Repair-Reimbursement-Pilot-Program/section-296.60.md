##### § 296.60 Applications. #####

(a) *Introduction.* This section sets forth MARAD's regulations governing its Maintenance and Repair (M&R) Reimbursement Pilot Program. The M&R program is presently a 5-year program, authorized at $19.5 million per year for FY 2006-2011.

(b) *M&R participants.* Every existing Contractor in MSP may enter into an agreement under 46 U.S.C. 3517, to perform qualified M&R of one or more MSP vessels in United States shipyards, subject to the terms of this section. Every MSP Contractor entering into an MSP operating agreement, including those agreements transferred from an existing MSP Contractor, or newly issued or reissued from MARAD, after March 8, 2007, must agree to enter into an agreement under 46 U.S.C. 3517, to perform qualified M&R of one or more MSP vessels in United States shipyards, subject to the terms of this section. Each vessel that is subject to an M&R agreement will receive a priority in the allocation of MSP payments if the amount available for a fiscal year for making payments under MSP operating agreements is not sufficient to pay the full amount authorized under each agreement for such fiscal year.

(c) *Terms of Agreement.* An agreement under this section:

(1) Will require that except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all qualified M&R on the vessel will be performed in the United States;

(2) Will require the Administrator to reimburse the Contractor in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section for the costs of qualified M&R performed in the United States; and

(3) Will apply to qualified M&R performed during the 5-year period beginning on the date the vessel begins operating under the operating agreement under chapter 531 of title 46, United States Code.

(d) *Exception to Requirement to Perform Work in the United States.* A Contractor will not be required to have qualified M&R work performed in the United States under this section if:

(1) The Administrator determines that there is no facility capable of meeting all technical requirements of the qualified M&R in the United States located in the geographic area in which the vessel normally operates available to perform the work in the time required by the Contractor to maintain its regularly scheduled service;

(2) The Administrator determines that there are insufficient funds to pay reimbursement under paragraph (j) of this section with respect to the work; or

(3) The Administrator fails to make the certification described in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.

(e) *Qualified M&R.* In this section the term “qualified M&R” means:

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section:

(i) Any inspection of a vessel that is -

(A) Required under chapter 33 of title 46, United States Code; and

(B) Performed in the period in which the vessel is subject to an agreement under this section;

(ii) Any M&R of a vessel that is determined, in the course of an inspection referred to in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, to be necessary; and

(iii) Any additional M&R the Contractor intends to undertake at the same time as the work described in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section; but (2) does not include:

(i) M&R not agreed to by the Contractor to be undertaken at the same time as the work described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section;

(ii) Work carried out as part of continuous machinery surveys and other similar requirements not associated with a drydocking of the vessel; or

(iii) Any emergency work that is necessary to enable a vessel to return to a port in the United States.

(f) *Qualification of Shipyard.* MARAD will assess the following factors in determining whether a proposed shipyard is capable of undertaking the proposed M&R:

(1) The dimension of the facility relative to the size of the vessel;

(2) The capacity and the reach of the lifting cranes necessary for performing the specified work; and

(3) The skills and experience of sufficient numbers of workers to complete the job in time to maintain the vessel's schedule.

(g) *Required information.* Under each M&R agreement, the participant must provide within 30 days of enrollment a schedule for regular and special surveys for each vessel in the agreement. At the same time, and on an annual basis by January 1 of each calendar year, each M&R participant must submit a schedule of anticipated M&R for each vessel under an M&R agreement for the coming year. In addition, the M&R participant must provide for each such vessel the anticipated itinerary for the coming year.

(h) *Notification Requirements.* (1) NOTIFICATION BY CONTRACTOR. - The Administrator is not required to pay reimbursement to a Contractor under this section for qualified M&R, unless the Contractor -

(i) Notifies the Administrator of the intent of the Contractor to obtain the qualified M&R, by not later than 90 days before the date of the performance of the qualified M&R; and

(ii) Includes in such notification:

(A) A description of all qualified M&R that the Contractor should reasonably expect may be performed;

(B) A description of the vessel's normal route and port calls in the United States;

(C) An estimate of the cost, with supporting documentation, of obtaining the qualified M&R described under paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section in the United States; and

(D) An estimate of the cost, with supporting documentation, of obtaining the qualified M&R described under paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section outside the United States, in the country in which the Contractor otherwise would undertake the qualified M&R.

(2) CERTIFICATION BY ADMINISTRATOR. -

(i) Not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of notification under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, the Administrator will certify to the Contractor -

(A) Whether the cost estimates provided by the Contractor are fair and reasonable;

(B) If the Administrator determines that such cost estimates are not fair and reasonable, the Administrator's estimate of fair and reasonable costs for such work;

(C) Whether there are available to the Administrator sufficient funds to pay reimbursement under paragraph (j) of this section with respect to such work; and

(D) That the Administrator commits such funds to the Contractor for such reimbursement, if such funds are available for that purpose.

(ii) If the Contractor notification described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section does not include an estimate of the cost of obtaining qualified M&R in the United States, then not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of such notification, the Administrator will:

(A) Certify to the Contractor whether there is a facility capable of meeting all technical requirements of the qualified M&R in the United States located in the geographic area in which the vessel normally operates available to perform the qualified M&R described in the notification by the Contractor under paragraph (h)(1) of this section in the time period required by the Contractor to maintain its regularly scheduled service; and

(B) If there is such a facility, require the Contractor to resubmit such notification with the required cost estimate for such facility.

(i) *Allocation of available funds.* If the funds available to MARAD are insufficient to accommodate every M&R project required to be performed in U.S. shipyards, MARAD will select those work projects suitable for accomplishment in United States shipyards, for which MARAD will reimburse the differential costs of the M&R. MARAD will base such determinations on the amount of funds available, the projected cost of each repair, the number of vessels operated by the vessel operator and the proximity of the vessels' itineraries to suitable U.S. shipyard locations.

(j) *Reimbursement.* (1) IN GENERAL. - The Administrator will, subject to the availability of appropriations, reimburse a Contractor for costs incurred by the Contractor for qualified M&R performed in the United States under this section.

(2) AMOUNT. - The amount of reimbursement will be equal to the difference between -

(i) The fair and reasonable cost of obtaining the qualified M&R in the United States; and

(ii) The fair and reasonable cost of obtaining the qualified M&R outside the United States, in the country in which the Contractor would otherwise undertake the qualified M&R.

(3) DETERMINATION OF FAIR AND REASONABLE COSTS. -

(i) The Administrator will determine fair and reasonable costs for purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this section after considering the supporting documentation submitted by the Contractor. If it is too difficult to accurately ascertain the foreign costs of anticipated M&R, the Maritime Administrator may decide to compute the foreign cost of M&R by reference to a percentage of the domestic cost of the M&R, based on available general information.

(ii) MARAD will also pay for other costs borne by the M&R participant reasonably associated with the qualified M&R performed in a U.S. shipyard that would not be incurred if the vessel was repaired in a foreign shipyard. Such costs include:

(A) Any additional vessel maintenance and repair preparation costs, including costs for additional engineering, design and contract bid proposal costs;

(B) Costs (including capital and operating costs) for “lost time” for transit to a U.S. shipyard in excess of the transit period to a foreign shipyard on the same trade route to which the vessel is assigned and for the time spent in a U.S. shipyard which exceeds the estimated time required by a foreign shipyard for the same work.

(C) Costs for additional labor, supervision, overhead and other work involving shore-side personnel.

(iii) Upon approval of each specific M&R project, the Administrator will establish with the Contractor a set level of funding to be provided by MARAD. If, during the course of performing M&R in a U.S. shipyard, it is discovered that the repairs will entail additional unanticipated costs, the Administrator shall provide MARAD's share of funding corresponding to the percentage of the domestic M&R costs originally agreed to by MARAD, but not in excess of 20 percent of the original funding level agreed to by MARAD. Cost overruns will be the obligation of the M&R participant unless MARAD determines that it is fair to reimburse the M&R participant and sufficient funds are available to do so.

(iv) Payment of MARAD's share of the shipyard contract price may be made as work progresses or upon completion of the M&R and finalization of costs, as MARAD may determine. Vouchers for payment may be submitted to the Associate Administer for Marine Asset Development. Payments shall be paid and processed under the terms and conditions of the Prompt Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. 3901. However, pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3902(f), interest on late payments will be paid only if appropriated funds for paying reimbursement under the M&R Pilot Program are available.
