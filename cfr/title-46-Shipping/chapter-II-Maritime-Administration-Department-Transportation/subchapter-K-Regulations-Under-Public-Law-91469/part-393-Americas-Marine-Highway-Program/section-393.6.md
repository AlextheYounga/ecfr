##### ยง 393.6 Research on Marine Highway Transportation. #####

(a) *Summary.* The Department will work in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and other entities as appropriate, within the limits of available resources, to conduct research in support of America's Marine Highway or in direct support of designated Marine Highway Corridors and Projects.

(b) *Objectives.* The primary objectives of selected research Projects are to:

(1) Identify and quantify environmental and transportation-related benefits that can be derived from utilization of the Marine Highways as compared to other modes of surface transportation.

(2) Identify existing or emerging technology, vessel design, and other improvements that would reduce emissions, increase fuel economy, and lower costs of Marine Highway transportation and increase the efficiency of intermodal transfers.
