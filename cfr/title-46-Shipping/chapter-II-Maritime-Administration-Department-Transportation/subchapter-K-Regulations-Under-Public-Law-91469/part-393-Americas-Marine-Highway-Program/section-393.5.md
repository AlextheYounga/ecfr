##### ยง 393.5 Incentives, Impediments and Solutions. #####

(a) *Summary.* The purpose of this section is to identify short term incentives and solutions to impediments in order to encourage use of the Marine Highway for freight and passengers.

(b) *Objectives.* This section is aimed at increasing the use of the Marine Highways through the following primary objectives:

(1) Encourage the integration of Marine Highways in transportation plans at the State, regional, local and Tribal levels.

(2) Develop short term incentives aimed at expanding existing or starting new Marine Highway operations.

(3) Identify and seek solutions to impediments to the Marine Highway.

(c) *Federal, State, Local, Regional and Tribal Transportation Planning.* The Department will coordinate with Federal, State, local and Tribal governments and Metropolitan Planning Organizations to develop strategies to encourage the use of America's Marine Highways for transportation of passengers and cargo. The Department will:

(1) Work with these entities to assess plans and develop strategies, where appropriate, to incorporate Marine Highway transportation, including ferries, and other marine transportation solutions for regional and interstate transport of freight and passengers in their statewide and metropolitan transportation plans.

(2) Facilitate groups of States and multi-State transportation entities to determine how Marine Highway transportation can address traffic delays, bottlenecks, and other interstate transportation challenges to their mutual benefit.

(3) Identify other Federal agencies that have jurisdiction over the project, or which currently provide funding for components of the project, in order to determine the extent to which those agencies should be consulted with and invited to assist in the coordination process.

(4) Consult with Federal Highway Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Federal Railroad Administration, Federal Transit Administration and other entities within DOT, as appropriate, for support and to evaluate costs and benefits of proposed Marine Highway Corridors and Projects.

(d) *Short-Term Incentives.* The Department will develop proposed short-term incentives to encourage the use, initiation, or expansion of Marine Highway services in consultation with shippers and other participants in transportation logistics, and government entities, as appropriate.

(e) *Impediments and Solutions.* The Department will either establish a board, or modify an existing body, in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), whose role is to identify impediments that hinder effective use of the Marine Highways and recommend solutions. The Board will meet regularly and report its findings and recommended solutions to the Maritime Administrator. Board membership will include, among others, representation by Federal Departments and Agencies, State Departments of Transportation, Metropolitan Planning Organizations and other local public entities including Tribal governments and private sector stakeholders. The Department will take actions, as appropriate, to address impediments to the Marine Highways.
