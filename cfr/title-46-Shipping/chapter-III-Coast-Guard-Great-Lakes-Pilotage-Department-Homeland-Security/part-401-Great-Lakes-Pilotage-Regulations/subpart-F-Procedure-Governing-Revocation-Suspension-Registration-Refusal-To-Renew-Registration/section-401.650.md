A reply shall be limited to the record before the Administrative Law Judge and the petition for review.

(c) If a petition for review is filed within the time prescribed, the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge shall be final fifteen (15) days after expiration of the time prescribed for filing a reply thereto unless the Commandant prior to expiration of the fifteen (15) days after expiration of the time prescribed for filing a reply thereto enters a written order granting the petition for review. If no petition for review is filed within the time prescribed and the Commandant does not elect to review on his own motion, the initial decision of the Administrative Law Judge shall be final twenty (20) days after the date of service of the decision.
