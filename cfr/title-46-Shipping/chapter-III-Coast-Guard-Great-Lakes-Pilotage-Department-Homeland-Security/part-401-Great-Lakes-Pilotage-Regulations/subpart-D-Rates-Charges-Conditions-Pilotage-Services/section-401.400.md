##### § 401.400 Calculation of pilotage units and determination of weighting factor. #####

The equivalent pilotage unit number and appropriate weighting factor for each ship must be computed by utilizing the following formula and table:

(a) Pilotage unit computation:

Pilot Unit = (Length × Breadth × Depth)/283.17 (measured in meters)Pilot Unit = (Length × Breadth × Depth)/10,000 (measured in feet)

(b) Weighting factor table:

|Range of pilotage units|Weighting factor|
|-----------------------|----------------|
|         0-49          |      1.0       |
|        50-159         |      1.15      |
|        160-189        |      1.30      |
|     190-and over      |      1.45      |

(c) The charge for pilotage service is obtained by multiplying the weighting factor, obtained from paragraph (b) of this section by the appropriate basic rate specified in §§ 401.405, 401.407, 401.410, 401.420 and 401.425.
