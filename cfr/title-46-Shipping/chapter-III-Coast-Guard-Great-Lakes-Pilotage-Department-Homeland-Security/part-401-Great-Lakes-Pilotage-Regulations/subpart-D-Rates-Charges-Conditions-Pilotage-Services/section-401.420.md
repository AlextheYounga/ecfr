(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a vessel can be charged as authorized in § 401.405 of this part for the waters in which the event takes place, if -

(1) A U.S. pilot is retained on board while a vessel's passage is interrupted;

(2) A U.S. pilot's departure from the vessel after the end of an assignment is delayed, and the pilot is detained on board, for the vessel's convenience; or

(3) A vessel's departure or movage is delayed, for the vessel's convenience, beyond the time that a U.S. pilot is scheduled to report for duty, or reports for duty as ordered, whichever is later.

(b) When an order for a U.S. pilot's service is cancelled after that pilot has begun traveling to the designated pickup place, the vessel can be charged for the pilot's reasonable travel expenses to and from the pilot's base; and the vessel can be charged for the time between the pilot's scheduled arrival, or the pilot's reporting for duty as ordered, whichever is later, and the time of cancellation.

(c) Between May 1 and November 30, a vessel is not liable for charges under paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section, if the interruption or detention was caused by ice, weather, or traffic.

(d) A pilotage charge made under this section takes the place and precludes payment of any charge that otherwise could be made under § 401.405 of this part.
