##### ยง 404.104 Ratemaking step 4: Determine target pilot compensation benchmark. #####

(a) In a full ratemaking year, the Director determines base individual target pilot compensation using a compensation benchmark, set after considering the most relevant currently available non-proprietary information. For supportable circumstances, the Director may make necessary and reasonable adjustments to the benchmark.

(b) In an interim year, the Director adjusts the previous year's individual target pilot compensation level by the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Employment Cost Index for the Transportation and Materials sector, or if that is unavailable, the Federal Open Market Committee median economic projections for Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation.

(c) The Director determines each pilotage association's total target pilot compensation by multiplying individual target pilot compensation computed in paragraph (a) or (b) of this section by the number of pilots projected under ยง 404.103(d) or ยง 401.220(a) of this chapter, whichever is lower.
