##### ยง 404.107 Ratemaking step 7: Initially calculate base rates. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 41496, Aug. 31, 2017.

(a) The Director initially calculates base hourly rates by dividing the projected needed revenue from ยง 404.106 of this part by averages of past hours worked in each district's designated and undesignated waters, using available and reliable data for a multi-year period set in accordance with ยง 404.103(b) of this part.

(b) If the result of this calculation initially shows an hourly rate for the designated waters of a district that would exceed twice the hourly rate for undesignated waters, the initial designated-waters rate will be adjusted so as not to exceed twice the hourly undesignated-waters rate. The adjustment is a reallocation only and will not increase or decrease the amount of revenue needed in the affected district.
