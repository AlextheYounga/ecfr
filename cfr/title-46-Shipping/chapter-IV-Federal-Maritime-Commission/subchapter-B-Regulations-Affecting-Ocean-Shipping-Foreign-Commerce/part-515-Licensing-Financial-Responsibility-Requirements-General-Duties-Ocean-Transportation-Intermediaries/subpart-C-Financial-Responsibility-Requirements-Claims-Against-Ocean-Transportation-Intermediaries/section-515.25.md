##### § 515.25 Filing of proof of financial responsibility. #####

(a) *Filing of proof of financial responsibility* - (1) *Licenses.* Upon notification by the Commission that an applicant has been approved for licensing, the applicant shall file with the Director of the Commission's Bureau of Certification and Licensing, proof of financial responsibility in the form and amount prescribed in § 515.21. No license will be issued until the Commission is in receipt of valid proof of financial responsibility from the applicant. If, within 120 days of notification of approval for licensing by the Commission, the applicant does not file proof that its financial responsibility is in effect, the application will be invalid. Applicants whose applications have become invalid may submit a new Form FMC-18, together with the required filing fee, at any time.

(2) *Registrations.* A registration shall not become effective until the applicant has furnished proof of financial responsibility pursuant to § 515.21, has submitted a Form FMC-1, and its published tariff becomes effective pursuant to 46 CFR part 520.

(b) *Optional bond rider.* Any NVOCC as defined in § 515.2(m)(2), in addition to a bond meeting the requirements of § 515.21(a)(2) or (3), may obtain and file with the Commission proof of an optional bond rider, as provided in Appendix E or Appendix F of this part.
