Section 9(c) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 40703, 40704(a)) authorizes the Commission to permit a controlled carrier's rates, charges, classifications, rules or regulations to become effective on less than 30 days' notice. The Commission may also in its discretion and for good cause shown, permit departures from the requirements of this part.

(b) *Clerical errors.* Typographical and/or clerical errors constitute good cause for the exercise of special permission authority but every application based thereon must plainly specify the error and present clear evidence of its existence, together with a full statement of the attending circumstances, and shall be submitted with reasonable promptness after publishing the defective tariff material.

Every such application must be submitted to the Bureau of Trade Analysis and be accompanied by a filing fee of $394.

(2) Applications for special permission shall be made only by letter, except that in emergency situations, application may be made by telephone or facsimile if the communication is promptly followed by a letter and the filing fee.

(i) Organization name, number and trade name of the conference or carrier;
