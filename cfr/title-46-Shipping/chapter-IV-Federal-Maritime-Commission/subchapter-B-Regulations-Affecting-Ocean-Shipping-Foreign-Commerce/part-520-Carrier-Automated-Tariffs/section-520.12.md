(a) *General.* Common carriers or conferences may publish in their tariffs rates which are conditioned upon the receipt of a specified aggregate volume of cargo or aggregate freight revenue over a specified period of time.

(b) *Publication requirements.* (1) All rates, charges, classifications rules and practices concerning time/volume rates must be set forth in the carrier's or conference's tariff.

(2) The tariff shall identify:

(i) The shipment records that will be maintained to support the rate; and

(ii) The method to be used by shippers giving notice of their intention to use a time/volume rate prior to tendering any shipments under the time/volume arrangement.

(c) *Accepted rates.* Once a time/volume rate is accepted by one shipper, it shall remain in effect for the time specified, without amendment. If no shipper gives notice within 30 days of publication, the time/volume rate may be canceled.

(d) *Records.* Shipper notices and shipment records supporting a time/volume rate shall be maintained by the offering carrier or conference for at least 5 years after a shipper's use of a time/volume rate has ended.
