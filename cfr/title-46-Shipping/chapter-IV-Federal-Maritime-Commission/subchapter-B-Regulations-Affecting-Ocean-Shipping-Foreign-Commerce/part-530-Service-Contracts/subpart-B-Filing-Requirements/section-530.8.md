Subsequent references in the contract to the contract parties shall be consistent with the first reference (e.g., (exact name), “carrier,” “shipper,” or “association,” etc.). Carrier parties which enter into contracts that include affiliates must either:

(i) List the affiliates' business addresses; or

(ii) Certify that this information will be provided to the Commission upon request within ten (10) business days of such request. However, the requirements of this section do not apply to amendments to contracts that have been filed in accordance with the requirements of this section unless the amendment adds new parties or affiliates;

(10) A certification of shipper status;

(11) A description of the shipment records which will be maintained to support the service contract and the address, telephone number, and title of the person who will respond to a request by making shipment records available to the Commission for inspection under § 530.15 of this part; and

(c) *Certainty of terms.* The terms described in paragraph (b) of this section may not:

(2) Make reference to terms not explicitly contained in the service contract itself unless those terms are readily available to the parties and the Commission.

(3) Pursuant to § 530.15(c), the carrier party to the service contract must, upon written request by the Commission, provide the Commission with the associated records of the referenced terms. For the purpose of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the referenced terms will be deemed readily available to the Commission if the carrier party to the service contract provides the Commission with the associated records of the terms within thirty (30) days of the Commission's written request.

(d) *Other requirements.* Every service contract filed with BTCL shall include, as set forth in appendix A to this part by:

(1) A unique service contract number of more than one (1) but less than ten (10) alphanumeric characters in length (“SC Number”); and

(2) A consecutively numbered amendment number no more than three digits in length, with initial service contracts using “0”(“Amendment number”);

(3) The filed FMC Agreement Number(s) assigned by the Commission under 46 CFR part 535 (if applicable); and

(4) An indication of the method by which the statement of essential terms will be published.

(e) *Exception in case of malfunction of Commission filing system.* (1) In the event that the Commission's filing systems are not functioning and cannot receive service contract filings for twenty-four (24) continuous hours or more, affected parties will not be subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and § 530.14(a) that a service contract be filed before cargo is shipped under it.

(2) However, service contracts which go into effect before they are filed, pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, must be filed within twenty-four (24) hours of the Commission's filing systems' return to service.

(3) Failure to file a service contract that goes into effect before it is filed, pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, within twenty-four (24) hours of the Commission's filing systems' return to service will be considered a violation of Commission regulations.
