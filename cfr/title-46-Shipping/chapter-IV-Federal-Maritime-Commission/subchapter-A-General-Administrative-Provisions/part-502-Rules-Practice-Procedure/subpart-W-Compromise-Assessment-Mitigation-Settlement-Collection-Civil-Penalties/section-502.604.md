Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 23363, Apr. 17, 2023.

(a) *Scope.* Except in pending civil penalty assessment proceedings provided for in ยง 502.603, the Commission, when it has reason to believe a violation has occurred, may invoke the informal compromise procedures of this section after observing the procedures in ยง 502.63(d).

(b) *Criteria for compromise.* In addition to the factors set forth in ยง 502.603(b), in compromising a penalty claim, the Commission may consider litigative probabilities, the cost of collecting the claim and enforcement policy.

(c) *Disposition of claims in compromise procedures.* (1) When a penalty is compromised and the respondent agrees to settle for that amount, a compromise agreement shall be executed. (One example of such compromise agreement is set forth as appendix A to this subpart.) This agreement, after reciting the nature of the claim, will include a statement evidencing the respondent's agreement to the compromise of the Commission's penalty claim for the amount set forth in the agreement and will also embody an approval and acceptance provision which is to be signed by the appropriate Commission official. Upon compromise of the penalty in the agreed amount, a duplicate original of the executed agreement shall be furnished to the respondent.

(2) Upon completion of the compromise, the Commission may issue a public notice thereof, the terms and language of which are not subject to negotiation.

(d) *Relation to assessment proceedings.* Except by order of the Commission, no compromise procedure shall be initiated or continued after institution of a Commission assessment proceeding directed to the same violations. Any offer of compromise submitted by the respondent pursuant to this section shall be deemed to have been furnished by the respondent without prejudice and shall not be used against the respondent in any proceeding.
