Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 33850, July 16, 2019.

(a) *The danger zone.* A section extending seaward for a distance of 12,000 yards between two radial lines bearing 030° True and 083° True, respectively, from a point on shore at latitude 36°46′48″ N, longitude 75°57′24″ W; and an adjacent sector extending seaward for a distance of 15 nautical miles between two radial lines bearing 083° True and 150° True, respectively, from the same shore position.

(b) *The regulations.* (1) Vessels shall proceed through the area with caution and shall remain therein no longer than necessary for purposes of transit.

(2) When firing is in progress during daylight hours, red flags will be displayed at conspicuous locations on the beach. When firing is in progress during periods of darkness, red flashing lights will be displayed from conspicuous locations on the beach which are visible from the water a minimum distance of four (4) nautical miles.

(3) Firing on the ranges will be suspended as long as any vessel is within the danger zone.

(4) Lookout posts will be manned by the activity or agency operating the firing range at the Fleet Combat Center, Atlantic, Dam Neck, Virginia Beach, Virginia. After darkness, night vision systems will be utilized by lookouts to aid in locating vessels transiting the area.

(5) There shall be no firing on the range during periods of low visibility which would prevent the recognition of a vessel (to a distance of 7,500 yards) which is properly displaying navigation lights, or which would preclude a vessel from observing the red range flags or lights.

(6) The regulations in this section shall be enforced by the Commander, Naval Air Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet/Commander, Fleet Air Norfolk, Norfolk, Va., and such agencies as he may designate.
