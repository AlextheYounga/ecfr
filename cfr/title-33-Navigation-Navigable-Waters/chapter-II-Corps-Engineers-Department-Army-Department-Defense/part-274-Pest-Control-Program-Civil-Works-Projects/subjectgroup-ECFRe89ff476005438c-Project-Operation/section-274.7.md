##### ยง 274.7 Authorization of pesticide use. #####

(a) Programs approved in ยง 274.6(b) must be those as described on the pesticide label. Pesticide uses which are different from the registered use, require amendment of the label, approved by the Environmental Protection Agency. Data requirements for this use must be supplied before an amendment will be made by the Agency. Substantial time and effort are required for such action.

(b) If an unexpected outbreak of a pest requires control measures which are not according to the registered use, such control effort is viewed as an emergency measure and may be undertaken at the discretion of the Division Engineer. An emergency will be deemed to exist when:

(1) A pest outbreak has or is about to occur and no pesticide registered for the particular use, or alternative method of control, is available to eradicate or control the pest.

(2) Significant economic or health problems will occur without the use of the pesticide.

(3) The time available from discovery or prediction of the pest outbreak is insufficient for a pesticide to be registered for the particular use. In determining whether an emergency condition exists, the Administrator will also give consideration to such additional facts requiring the use of Section 18 ยง 274.3(a) as are presented by the applicant.

(c) Emergency operations should be documented by a request for a specific exemption, prepared by the District and forwarded through channels to HQDA (DAEN-CWO-R) WASH DC 20314 for transmittal to EPA.

(1) Each specific exemption must be requested in writing, by the head of the Federal agency or the Governor of the State involved, or other official designee, addressed to the Administator, setting forth the following information:

(i) The nature, scope and frequency of the emergency.

(ii) A description of the pest known to occur, the places or times it may be likely to occur and the estimated time when treatment must be commenced to be effective.

(iii) Whether a pesticide registered for the particular use, or other method of eradicating or controlling the pest, is available to meet the emergency, and the basis for such determination.

(iv) A listing of the pesticide or pesticides the agency proposes to use in the event of an outbreak.

(v) Description of the nature of the program for eradication or control. Such description should include:

(A) Quantity of the pesticide expected to be applied;

(B) Specific Area or place of application;

(C) Method of application;

(D) Duration of application;

(E) Qualifications of personnel involved in such application.

(vi) Statement of economic benefits and losses anticipated with and without the exemption and under reasonable alternatives.

(vii) Analysis of possible adverse effects on man and the environment. If an Environmental Impact Statement has been prepared by an agency, in accordance with that agency's regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and is relevant to the above, it shall be submitted with the application.

(viii) Such exemptions, if granted, are valid only for the specific situation involved and are subject to such restrictions as the Administrator may prescribe in granting the exemption. Such restrictions may include, among others, limitations on the quantity of the pesticide to be used, the conditions under which the pesticide may be applied, restrictions as to the person who may apply the pesticide and the type of monitoring activities which should be conducted. Within one year of the granting of the exemption, a summary report on what action was taken to meet the emergency and on the outcome of such action, must be forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-CWO-R) WASH DC 20314, for forwarding to EPA.
