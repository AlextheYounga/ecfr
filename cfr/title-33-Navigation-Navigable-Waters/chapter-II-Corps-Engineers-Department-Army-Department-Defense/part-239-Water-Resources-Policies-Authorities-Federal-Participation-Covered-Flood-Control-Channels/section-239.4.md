##### ยง 239.4 Policy. #####

Projects will be formulated and evaluated in accordance with the policies and procedures described in ER 1105-2-200. If, during the planning process, it appears that covered flood control channels are desirable, reporting officers may evaluate them and include them when they best serve the public interest. Selection of the plan which best serves the public interest is based upon the ability of the plan to meet planning objectives, the contributions which the plan makes to the National Economic Development (NED), Environmental Quality (EQ), Regional Development (RD) and Social Well Being (SWB) accounts, and the public response to alternative plans. Thus, covered flood control channels may be proposed if they are desired by the public and (a) increase net EQ and/or NED benefits; or, (b) reduce adverse effects on RD or SWB without incurring an unjustified loss in net NED or EQ benefits.
