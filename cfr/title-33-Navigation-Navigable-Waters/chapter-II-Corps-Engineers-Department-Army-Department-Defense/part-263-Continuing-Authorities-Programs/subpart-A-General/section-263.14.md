##### ยง 263.14 Program eligibility requirements. #####

Work funded under this Program must meet the requirements of Federal interest and Corps responsibility set forth in one of the legislative authorities referenced in ยง 263.13. Any project recommended must be justified under established Federal planning criteria, must be complete in itself and must not obligate the Federal government to future work except for those cases in which maintenance by the Federal government is provided by applicable provisions of general law. Eligibility is not permitted for the following:

(a) *Projects specifically authorized by Congress.* The Program will not be used to implement any portion of a project specifically authorized by Congress, including postauthorization changes to such projects. However, once a project has been completed to the full extent permitted by its Congressional authorization, this Program could be utilized to provide for a new, complete-in-itself improvement which will not impair or substantially change the purposes of the specifically authorized project.

(b) *Existing non-Federal responsibility.* This Program may not be utilized for a project that would in effect nullify or change an existing condition of non-Federal responsibility required for a project specifically authorized by Congress, whether constructed or not. Such changes would require Congressional action.

(c) *Operation and maintenance of non-Federal projects.* This Program may not be used for adoption of a non-Federal project for future maintenance at Federal expense.
