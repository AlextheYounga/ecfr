##### ยง 263.18 Program completion-time objectives. #####

To provide a Program responsive to local needs, the following target (maximum) completion time objectives are established and should be used to the extent feasible, in scheduling work and programming funds. Shortening of these objectives is encouraged for specific studies and projects when appropriate. However, high standards of planning, design and construction are not to be sacrificed. Attainment of completion-time objectives through intensive management is to be a major concern for those elements and individuals given Program management responsibilities in ยง 263.16 of this regulation.
