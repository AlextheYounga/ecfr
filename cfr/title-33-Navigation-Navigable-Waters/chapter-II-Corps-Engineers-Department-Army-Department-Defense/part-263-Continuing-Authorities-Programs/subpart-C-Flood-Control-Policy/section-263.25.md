##### § 263.25 Authority for emergency streambank and shoreline protection of public works and nonprofit public services (Section 14). #####

(a) *Legislative authority.* Section 14 of the Flood Control Act approved July 24, 1946, as amended by section 27 of the Water Resources Development Act approved March 7, 1974, states:

The Secretary of the Army is authorized to allot from any appropriations heretofore or hereinafter made for flood control, not to exceed $10,000,000 per year, for the construction, repair, restoration, and modification of emergency streambank and shoreline protection works to prevent damage to highways, bridge approaches, public works, churches, hospitals, schools, and other nonprofit public services, when in the opinion of the Chief of Engineers such work is advisable: *Provided,* That not more than $250,000 shall be allotted for this purpose at any single locality from the appropriations for any one fiscal year.

(b) *Policy.* Work under the Section 14 authority shall serve to prevent flood or erosion damages to endangered highways, highway bridge approaches, public works, and nonprofit public facilities by the construction or repair of emergency streambank and shoreline protection works. Eligible highways consist of major highway systems of national importance, and principal highways, streets, and roads of importance to the local community, such as arterial streets, important access routes to other communities and adjacent settlements, and roads designated as primary farm-to-market roads.

(1) Work under this authority is not limited in engineering scope but the design must be an integrally complete within itself project that does not require additional work for effective and successful operation. The cost limitation on Federal participation may require that local interests supplement the Federal funds, so that combined Federal and local efforts will produce a complete, useful improvement.

(2) Reporting officers must be satisfied that the protection of eligible public works and non-profit public services are justified on the basis of the National Economic Development and Environmental Quality objectives.

(c) *Legislative interpretations.* (1) “Public Works” are considered to be those important and essential public facilities which serve the general public and are owned and operated by the Federal, State, or local governments, such as municipal water supply systems and sewage disposal plants.

(2) “Churches, hospitals, schools” includes churches, and public and private non-profit hospitals and schools.

(3) “Non-profit public services” are considered to be facilities or structures which serve the general public and are not intended to earn a profit. Although they may be publicly used, privately owned, profit-making facilities located along streambanks or shore lines are not eligible for protection.

(4) “Shoreline” includes, but is not limited to, oceans, gulfs, and the Great Lakes.

(d) *Local cooperation.* The provisions of § 263.23(d) are applicable.
