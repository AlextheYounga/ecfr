##### ยง 240.5 Discussion. #####

Discussion of this legislation is contained in the Conference Report, H.R. Rpt. No. 99-1013, which accompanies H.R. 6. The House passed version of the bill contained a number of project-specific provisions that authorized credit against the non-Federal share for compatible work completed by local interests. The Senate passed version authorized crediting of compatible flood control works for projects under study. Both general provisions would enable local interests to proceed with compatible work on the understanding that the local improvements would be considered a part of the Federal project for the purpose of benefit-to-cost analysis, as well as subsequent cost sharing. The Conference Committee deleted virtually all of the crediting provisions applicable to individual projects and expanded the general provision allowing the Secretary to credit the cost of certain work undertaken by local interests prior to project authorization against the non-Federal share of project costs and to consider the benefits and costs in the economic evaluation of a more comprehensive project. This authority provides a basis for non-Federal interests to undertake local work to alleviate flood damages in the period preceding authorization of a Federal project with assurance that they will not adversely affect the project's economic feasibility. It provides local sponsors more flexibility in meeting their flood problems.
