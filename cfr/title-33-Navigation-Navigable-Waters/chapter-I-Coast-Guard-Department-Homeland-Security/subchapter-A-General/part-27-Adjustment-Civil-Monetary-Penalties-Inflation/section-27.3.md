##### § 27.3 Penalty adjustment table. #####

Table 1 identifies the statutes administered by the Coast Guard that authorize a civil monetary penalty.

The adjusted civil penalty amounts listed in Table 1 to this section are applicable for penalty assessments issued after June 17, 2020, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015. The applicable civil penalty amounts for violations occurring on or before November 2, 2015, are set forth in previously published regulations amending this part.
