##### § 27.3 Penalty adjustment table. #####

Table 1 identifies the statutes administered by the Coast Guard that authorize a civil monetary penalty. The “adjusted maximum penalty” is the maximum penalty authorized by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, as determined by the Coast Guard. The adjusted civil penalty amounts listed in Table 1 to this section are applicable for penalty assessments issued after January 11, 2022, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015. The applicable civil penalty amounts for violations occurring on or before November 2, 2015, are set forth in previously published regulations amending this part.
