(a) The drawspan for the Main Street (1/SR 90) drawbridge, mile 24.7, at Jacksonville, must open on signal except that, from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Saturday except Federal holidays, the drawspan need not be opened for the passage of vessels.

(b) The draw of the Florida East Coast automated railroad bridge, mile 24.9, shall operate as follows:

(1) The bridge shall be constantly tended and have a mechanical override capability for the automated operation. A radiotelephone shall be maintained at the bridge for the safety of navigation.

(2) The draw is normally in the fully open position, displaying flashing green lights to indicate that vessels may pass.

(3) When a train approaches, large signs on both the upstream and downstream sides of the bridge flash “Bridge Coming Down,” the lights go to flashing red, and siren signals sound. After an eight minute delay, the draw lowers and locks if there are no vessels under the draw. The draw remains down for a period of eight minutes or while the approach track circuit is occupied.

(4) After the train has cleared, the draw opens and the lights return to flashing green.
