(a) The drawspan for the Main Street (1/SR 90) drawbridge, mile 24.7, at Jacksonville, must open on signal except that, from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Saturday except Federal holidays, the drawspan need not be opened for the passage of vessels.

(b) The draw of the Florida East Coast automated railroad bridge, mile 24.9, shall operate as follows:

(1) The bridge shall be constantly tended and have a mechanical override capability for the automated operation. A radiotelephone shall be maintained at the bridge for the safety of navigation.

(2) The draw is normally in the fully open position, displaying flashing green lights to indicate that vessels may pass.
