(a) The draws of the Conrail and the New York, Susquehanna and Western railroad bridges, mile 0.0 both at Ridgefield Park, NJ, operate as follows:

(1) The draws shall open on signal if at least 24 hours notice is given.

(2) Public vessels of the United States must be passed through the drawspan of each drawbridge as soon as possible.

(3) The owners of these bridges shall provide and keep in good legible condition two board gages painted white with black figures not less than 12 inches high to indicate the vertical clearance under the closed draw at all stages of the tide. The gages shall be so placed on the bridge that they are plainly visible to operators of vessels approaching the bridge either up or downstream.

(b) Trains and locomotives shall be controlled so that any delay in opening the draw span shall not exceed five minutes. However, if a train moving toward the bridge has crossed the home signal for the bridge before the signal requesting opening of the bridge is given, the train may continue across the bridge and must clear the bridge interlocks before stopping.
