##### § 117.9 Delaying opening of a draw. #####

No person shall unreasonably delay the opening of a draw after the signals required by § 117.15 have been given.

Note:

Trains are usually controlled by the block method. That is, the track is divided into blocks or segments of a mile or more in length. When a train is in a block with a drawbridge, the draw may not be able to open until the train has passed out of the block and the yardmaster or other manager has “unlocked” the drawbridge controls. The maximum time permitted for delay is defined in Subpart B for each affected bridge. Land and water traffic should pass over or through the draw as soon as possible in order to prevent unnecessary delays in the opening and closure of the draw.
