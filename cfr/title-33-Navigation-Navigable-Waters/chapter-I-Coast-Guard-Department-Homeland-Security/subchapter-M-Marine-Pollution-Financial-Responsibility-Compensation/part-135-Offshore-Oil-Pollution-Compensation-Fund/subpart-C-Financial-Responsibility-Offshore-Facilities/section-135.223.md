(1) Is no longer the owner or operator of the offshore facility in question;

(2) Fails to furnish acceptable evidence of financial responsibility in support of an application; or

(3) Permits the cancellation or termination of the insurance policy, surety bond, indemnity, or guaranty upon which the continued validity of the certificate is based.

(c) In any other case, before the denial or revocation of a certificate, the Fund Administrator advises the applicant or certificant, in writing, of the intention to deny or revoke the certificate, and shall state the reason therefor.

(d) If the reason for an intended revocation is failure to file the reports or documents required by ยง 135.213 (c) and (d) the revocation shall be effective 10 days after the date of receipt of the notice of intention to revoke, unless the certificant shall, before revocation, submit the required material or demonstrate that the required material was timely filed.

(e) If the intended denial or revocation is based upon one of the reasons in paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this section, the applicant or certificant may request, in writing, a hearing to show that the applicant or certificant is in compliance with this subpart. If the applicant or certificant fails to file a timely request for a hearing, the denial or revocation is effective 10 days after receipt of the notice.

If a requesting party fails to enter an appearance at the scheduled hearing, or in lieu thereof fails to submit written evidence for the consideration of the hearing official, denial or revocation is effective as of the scheduled date and time of the hearing, unless an extension of time is granted by the Fund Administrator for good cause shown.
