(2) Any vessel anchoring under circumstances of great emergency outside of the anchorage area shall be shifted to new berths within the area immediately after the emergency ceases.

(3) All vessels shall lie at anchor with as short a cable as conditions will permit.

(4) A vessel upon being notified to move into the anchorage limits or to shift its position on the anchorage ground must get under way at once or signal for a tug, and must change position as directed with reasonable promptness.

(5) Whenever the maritime or commercial interests of the United States so require, the Captain of the Port, U.S. Coast Guard, Miami, Fla., is hereby empowered to shift the position of any vessel anchored on the anchorage ground or outside thereof, or of any vessel moored or anchored so as to impede or obstruct vessel movements or obstruct or interfere with range lights.

(6) Vessels carrying explosives shall be anchored only under a written permit issued by the Captain of the Port and at such point as he may direct.

(7) Vessels carrying explosives shall be at all times in charge of a competent person, and must display by day a red flag, of not less than 16 square feet, at the masthead, or not less than 10 feet above the upper deck if the vessel has no mast; at night a red light shall be displayed in the positions specified for the red flag.

(8) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as relieving the owner or person in charge of any vessel from the penalties of the law for obstructing navigation, or for obstructing or interfering with range lights, or for not complying with the navigation laws in regard to lights, fog signals, or other aids to navigation, or for otherwise violating law.

(9) All vessels desiring to use the Anchorage must notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, via the Biscayne Bay Pilots on VHF-FM Channel 12 or 16.
