##### § 110.214 Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors, California. #####

(a) *General Regulations*—(1) *Anchorage Assignment.* (i) Unless otherwise directed by the Captain of the Port Los Angeles-Long Beach, the pilot stations for the Port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles will assign the use of commercial anchorages within their jurisdictions (Long Beach and Los Angeles Harbors respectively). All anchorages outside (seaward) of the federal breakwater will be assigned by the Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service (VTIS). The master, pilot, or person in charge of a vessel must notify the appropriate pilot station (for anchorages inside the federal breakwater) or the VTIS (for anchorages outside the federal breakwater) of their intention to anchor, upon anchoring, and at least fifteen minutes prior to departing an anchorage. All anchorage assignments will be made as described in this part unless modified by the Captain of the Port.

(ii) Radio communications for port entities governing anchorages are as follows: Los Angeles-Long Beach Vessel Traffic Information Service, call sign “LA-Long Beach Traffic,” Channel 14 VHF-FM; Los Angeles Port Pilots, Channel 73 VHF-FM; Long Beach Port Pilots, Channel 74 VHF-FM.

(iii) The exact boundary separating the Port of Long Beach from the Port of Los Angeles is published in local Port Tariffs. For purposes of this rule, Long Beach waters are those east, and Los Angeles waters are those west, of the following locations:

(A) Inner Harbor: The Henry Ford (Badger Avenue) Bridge.

(B) Middle Harbor: The Pier 400 Transportation Corridor.

(C) Outer Harbor: The western boundary of Commercial Anchorage B.

(2) *Required approvals, permits and notifications.* (i)(A) No vessel may anchor in deep draft sub-anchorages B-7, B-9, B-11, D-5, D-6 or D-7 within Los Angeles or Long Beach harbors for more than 48 consecutive hours unless extended anchorage permission is obtained from the Captain of the Port. These sub-anchorages are defined by the following coordinates and dimensions:

|Anchorage|   Latitude   |   Longitude   |Radius  <br/>(yards)|
|---------|--------------|---------------|--------------------|
|   B-7   |33-43′ 52.0″ N|118-12′ 47.9″ W|        450         |
|   B-9   |33-43′ 28.5″ N|118-13′ 10.5″ W|        500         |
|  B-11   |33-43′ 44.5″ N| 118-12′ 17″ W |        450         |
|   D-5   |33-43′ 40.5′ N| 118-10′ 30″ W |        450         |
|   D-6   |33-43′ 40.5′ N|118-9′ 57.5″ W |        450         |
|   D-7   |33-43′ 40.5′ N| 118-9′ 25″ W  |        450         |

(B) No vessel may anchor anywhere else within Los Angeles or Long Beach harbors for more than 10 consecutive days unless extended anchorage permission is obtained from the Captain of the Port. In determining whether extended anchorage permission will be granted, consideration will be given, but not necessarily limited to: The current and anticipated demands for anchorage space within the harbor, the requested duration, the condition of the vessel, and the reason for the request.

(ii) No vessel while carrying, loading, or unloading division 1.1 or 1.2 materials as defined in 49 CFR 173.50, or Cargoes of Particular Hazard (COPH) as defined in 33 CFR 126.10, or Certain Dangerous Cargoes (CDC) as defined in 33 CFR 160.202, may anchor without first obtaining a permit issued by the Captain of the Port.

(iii) Vessels requiring use of an explosives anchorage should contact the Captain of the Port at least 24 hours prior to the anticipated need for the explosives anchorage to allow for proper activation of that anchorage.

(iv) Except with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, or, in the case of an emergency, with approval of the Captain of the Port immediately subsequent to anchoring, no commercial vessel greater than 1600 gross tons may anchor in Los Angeles-Long Beach Harbor unless it maintains the capability to get underway within 30 minutes. Any vessel unable to meet this requirement must immediately notify the Captain of the Port and make arrangements for an adequate number of tugs to respond to the vessel within 30 minutes notice.

(v) In anchorages where lightering is authorized, the Captain of the Port must be notified at least 4 hours in advance of a vessel conducting lightering operations (see 33 CFR 156.118).

(3) *Other General Requirements.* (i) When at anchor, all commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross tons shall, at all times, have a licensed or credentialed deck officer on watch and maintain a continuous radio listening watch unless subject to one of the exemptions in this paragraph. The radio watch must be on CH-13 VHF-FM when anchored inside the federal breakwater, and on CH-14 VHF-FM or on CH-16 VHF-FM when anchored outside the federal breakwater, except for unmanned barges; vessels which have less than 100 gallons of oil or fuel onboard regardless of how the fuel is carried; and other vessels receiving advance approval from the Captain of the Port.

(ii) When sustained wind speeds exceed 40 knots, all anchored commercial vessels greater than 1600 gross tons shall ensure their propulsion plant is placed in immediate standby and a second anchor is made ready to let go. Vessels unable to comply with this requirement must immediately notify the Captain of the Port. In such case, the Captain of the Port may require the vessel to have one or more tugs standing by to render immediate assistance.

(4) *Prohibitions.* Within Los Angeles Harbor, Long Beach Harbor, and the Los Angeles-Long Beach Precautionary Area, except for emergency reasons, or with the prior approval of the Captain of the Port, vessels are prohibited from anchoring outside of designated anchorage areas. In the event a vessel anchors outside a designated anchorage area for emergency reasons, the master, pilot, or person in charge of the vessel shall:

(i) Position the vessel so as to minimize the danger to other vessels and facilities;

(ii) Immediately notify the Captain of the Port by the most expeditious means of the vessel's location and the reason(s) for the emergency anchoring; and

(iii) Move the vessel as soon as the emergency condition prompting anchoring outside a designated area abates, or as soon as ordered to move by the Captain of the Port, whichever occurs sooner.

(5) *Exemption from rules.* The Captain of the Port may, upon request, or whenever he/she deems appropriate, authorize a deviation from any rule in this section.

(b) *The anchorage grounds.* Locations of anchorage grounds are as described in this section. Specific requirements for individual anchorages are contained in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. All coordinates referenced use datum: NAD 83.
