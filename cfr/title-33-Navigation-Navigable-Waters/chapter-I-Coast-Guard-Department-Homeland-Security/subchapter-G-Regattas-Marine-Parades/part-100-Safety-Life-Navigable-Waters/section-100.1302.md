(a) *Regulated area.* All waters of the Willamette River shore to shore, bordered on the north by the Hawthorne Bridge, and on the south by the Marquam Bridge.

(b) *Definition.* For purposes of this section, *race area* means an area 536-meters-long by 80-feet-wide designated by buoys and floatation line markers within the regulated area described in paragraph (a) of this section. The buoys have 4-foot poles attached to them. Two of the buoys are red, one is white, and the other is yellow. The course runs from the north side of the Hawthorne bridge south along the east bank to the east most pier of the Markham bridge and from the south side of the Markham bridge to the east pier of the center span. The center span is left open to allow commercial traffic through during the event. The course then continues from the west Pier of the center span and to the first pier west on the south side of the piers and continues north and ends at River Place dock.

(c) *Enforcement period.* The event is a two-day event which will be enforced one weekend in June each year. The specific dates will be published each year in the Federal Register.

(d) *Special local regulation.* (1) Non-participant vessels are prohibited from entering the race area unless authorized by the Coast Guard Patrol Commander.

(2) All persons or vessels not registered with the sponsor as participants or not part of the regatta patrol are considered spectators. Spectator vessels must be moored to a waterfront facility in a way that will not interfere with the progress of the event or have permission to enter the area from the event sponsor or Coast Guard patrol commander. Spectators must proceed at a safe speed as not to cause a wake. This requirement will be strictly enforced to preserve the safety of both life and property.

(3) A succession of sharp, short signals by whistle or horn from vessels patrolling the area under the direction of the Patrol Commander shall serve as a signal to stop. Vessels signaled shall stop and shall comply with the orders of the patrol vessel. Failure to do so may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.
