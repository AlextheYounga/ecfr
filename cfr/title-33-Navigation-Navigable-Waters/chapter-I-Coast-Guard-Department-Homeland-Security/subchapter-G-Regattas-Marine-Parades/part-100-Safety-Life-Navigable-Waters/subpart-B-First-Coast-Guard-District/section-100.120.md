(d) The Patrol Commander may control the movement of all vessels in the regulated area. When hailed or signaled by an official patrol vessel, a vessel shall come to an immediate stop and comply with the lawful directions issued. Failure to comply with a lawful direction may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.

(e) The Patrol Commander may delay or terminate any marine event in this subpart at any time it is deemed necessary to ensure the safety of life or property.
