##### § 100.100 Special Local Regulations; Regattas and Boat Races in the Coast Guard Sector Long Island Sound Captain of the Port Zone. #####

(a) The following regulations apply to the marine events listed in the Table to § 100.100. These regulations will be enforced for the duration of each event, on or about the dates indicated. Notifications will be made to the local maritime community through all appropriate means such as Local Notice to Mariners or Broadcast Notice to Mariners well in advance of the events. If the event does not have a date listed, then exact dates and times of the enforcement period will be announced through a Notice of Enforcement in the Federal Register. The First Coast Guard District Local Notice to Mariners can be found at: *http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/.*

(b) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply to this section:

(1) *Designated representative.* A “designated representative” is any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant or petty officer of the U.S. Coast Guard who has been designated by the Captain of the Port (COTP), Sector Long Island Sound (LIS), to act on his or her behalf. The designated representative may be on an official patrol vessel or may be on shore and will communicate with vessels via VHF-FM radio or loudhailer. In addition, members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary may be present to inform vessel operators of this regulation.

(2) *Official patrol vessels.* Official patrol vessels may consist of any Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, state, or local law enforcement vessels assigned or approved by the COTP.

(3) *Spectators.* All persons and vessels not registered with the event sponsor as participants or official patrol vessels.

(c) Although listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, sponsors of events listed in Table to § 100.100 are still required to submit marine event applications in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15. Each application must:

(1) Be submitted no less than 60 days before the date of the proposed event.

(2) If the proposed event does not have a specified date the sponsor shall hold the event during the month it is listed in Table to § 100.100.

(3) Any proposed event not being held on the specified date or within the month listed in Table to § 100.100 shall be considered a new marine event and the sponsor shall submit a new marine event application in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15 no less than 135 days before the start of the event.

(d) Vessel operators desiring to enter or operate within the regulated areas shall contact the COTP at 203-468-4401 (Sector LIS command center) or the designated representative via VHF channel 16.

(e) Vessels may not transit the regulated areas without the COTP or designated representative approval. Vessels permitted to transit must operate at a no wake speed, in a manner which will not endanger participants or other crafts in the event.

(f) Spectators or other vessels shall not anchor, block, loiter, or impede the transit of event participants or official patrol vessels in the regulated areas during the effective dates and times, or dates and times as modified through the Local Notice to Mariners, unless authorized by COTP or designated representative.

(g) The COTP or designated representative may control the movement of all vessels in the regulated area. When hailed or signaled by an official patrol vessel, a vessel shall come to an immediate stop and comply with the lawful directions issued. Failure to comply with a lawful direction may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.

(h) The COTP or designated representative may delay or terminate any marine event in this subpart at any time it is deemed necessary to ensure the safety of life or property.

(i) For all power boat races listed, vessels not participating in this event, swimmers, and personal watercraft of any nature are prohibited from entering or moving within the regulated area unless authorized by the COTP or designated representative. Vessels within the regulated area must be at anchor within a designated spectator area or moored to a waterfront facility in a way that will not interfere with the progress of the event.
