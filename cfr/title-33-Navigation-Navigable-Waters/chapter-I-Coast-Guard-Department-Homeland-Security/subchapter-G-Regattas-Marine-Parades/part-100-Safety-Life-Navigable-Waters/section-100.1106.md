(b) *Enforcement Period.* The following regulations will be enforced between the hours of 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on one day between November 1 of each year and March 31 of the following year. Annual notice of the specific enforcement dates and times of these regulations will be announced via Broadcast Notice to Mariners and published by the Coast Guard in a Boating Public Safety Notice at least 24 hours in advance of the competition. Annual notice of the specific enforcement dates and times will also be published in a Notice of Enforcement in the Federal Register each year.

(c) *Definitions.* (1) *Patrol Commander.* As used in this section, “Patrol Commander” or “PATCOM” means a Coast Guard Patrol Commander, including a Coast Guard coxswain, petty officer, or other officer, or a Federal, State, or local officer designated by the Captain of the Port San Francisco (COTP) pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding with that agency, to assist in the enforcement of the special local regulation.

(2) *Regulated Area.* As used in this section “Regulated Area” means the area in which the Maverick's Invitational Surf Competition will take place. This area is bounded by an arc extending 1000 yards from Sail Rock (37°29′34″ N, 122°30′02″ W) excluding the waters within Pillar Point Harbor. All coordinates are North American Datum 1983. Within the Regulated Area, at least two zones will be established and marked by buoys on the day of the competition. Due to the dynamic and changing nature of the surf, the exact size and location of the zones will not be made public until the competition day. The zones will be prominently marked by at least 8 buoys, placed by the event sponsor in a pattern approved by PATCOM. In addition, the USCG will notify the public of the zone locations via broadcast notice to mariners on the day of the event.

(3) *Zone 1.* As used in this section, “Zone 1” means the competition area within the Regulated Area. Zone 1 will generally be located to the northwest of a line drawn between Sail Rock (37°29′34″ N, 122°30′02″ W) and Pillar Point Entrance Lighted Gong Buoy 1 (37°29′10.410″ N, 122°30′21.904″ W).

(4) *Zone 2.* As used in this section, “Zone 2” means the area within the Regulated Area where the Coast Guard may direct the movement of all vessels, including restricting vessels from this area. Due to weather and sea conditions, the Captain of the Port may deny access to Zone 2 and the remainder of the regulated area to all vessels other than competitors and support vessels on the day of the event. Zone 2 will generally be located to the southeast of a line drawn between Sail Rock (37°29′34″ N, 122°30′02″ W) and Pillar Point Entrance Lighted Gong Buoy 1 (37°29′10.410″ N, 122°30′21.904″ W).
