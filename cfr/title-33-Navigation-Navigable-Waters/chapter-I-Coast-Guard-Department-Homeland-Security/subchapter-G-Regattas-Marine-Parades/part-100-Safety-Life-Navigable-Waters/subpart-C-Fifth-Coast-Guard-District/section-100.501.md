##### § 100.501 Special Local Regulations; Marine Events within the Fifth Coast Guard District. #####

This section applies to the marine events listed in the Table to § 100.501. These regulations will be effective annually, for the duration of each event listed in the Table to § 100.501. Annual notice of the exact dates and times of the effective period of the regulation with respect to each event, the geographical area, and details concerning the nature of the event and the number of participants and type(s) of vessels involved will be published in Local Notices to Mariners and via Broadcast Notice to Mariners over VHF-FM marine band radio.

(a) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply to this section:

(1) *Coast Guard Patrol Commander.* A Patrol Commander (PATCOM) is a commissioned, warrant, or petty officer of the Coast Guard who has been designated by the respective Coast Guard Sector - Captain of the Port to enforce these regulations.

(2) *Official patrol.* Any vessel assigned or approved by the respective Captain of the Port with a commissioned, warrant, or petty officer on board and displaying a Coast Guard ensign.

(3) *Spectators.* All persons and vessels not registered with the event sponsor as participants or official patrol vessels.

(4) *Regulated area.* An area where Special local regulations apply to a specific described waterway to include creeks, sounds, bays, rivers and, oceans. Regulated areas include all waters of a specific body of water described with intent to define boundaries where the Coast Guard enforces Special local regulations. Boundaries may be described from shoreline to shoreline, reference bridges, or other fixed structures, by points and lines defined by latitude and longitude. All coordinates reference Datum: NAD 1983.

(b) *Marine event patrol.* The Coast Guard will assign a marine event patrol, as described in § 100.40, to each regulated event listed in the table. Additionally, a PATCOM will be assigned to oversee the patrol. The marine event patrol and PATCOM may be contacted on VHF-FM Channel 16. The PATCOM may terminate the event, or the operation of any vessel participating in the marine event, at any time if deemed necessary for the protection of life or property. Only designated marine event participants and their vessels and official patrol vessels are authorized to enter the regulated area.

(c) *Special local regulations.* (1) *Controls on vessel movement.* The PATCOM or designated marine event patrol may forbid and control the movement of all vessels in the regulated area(s). When hailed or signaled by an official patrol vessel, a vessel in these areas shall immediately comply with the directions given. Failure to do so may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.

(2) *Directions, instructions, and minimum speed necessary.* The operator of any vessel in the regulated area shall:

(i) Stop the vessel immediately when directed to do so by any Official Patrol and then proceed only as directed.

(ii) All persons and vessels shall comply with the instructions of the Official Patrol.

(iii) Vessel operators may request permission to enter and transit through a regulated area by contacting the PATCOM on VHF-FM channel 16. When authorized to transit through the regulated area, vessels shall proceed at the minimum speed necessary to maintain a safe course that minimizes wake near the race course or marine event area.

(3) *Race area.* This is an area described by a line bound by coordinates provided in latitude and longitude that outlines the boundary of a race area within the regulated area defined by this part. Only event sponsor designated participants or designated participating vessels and official patrol vessels are allowed to enter the race area. Persons or vessel operators may request authorization to enter and transit through the regulated area by contacting the PATCOM on VHF-FM Channel 16.

(4) *Spectator area.* This is an area described by a line bound by coordinates provided in latitude and longitude that outlines the boundary of a spectator area within the regulated area defined by this part. Spectators are only allowed inside the regulated area if they remain within a designated spectator area. All spectator vessels shall be anchored or operate at a No Wake Speed within the designated spectator area. On scene designated PATCOM representatives will direct spectator vessels to the spectator area. Spectators shall contact the PATCOM to request permission to pass through the regulated area. If permission is granted, spectators must pass directly through the regulated area at safe speed and without loitering.

(5) *Buffer area.* This is a neutral zone that surrounds the perimeter of a Race Area or Marine Event Area within the regulated area described by this part. The purpose of a buffer zone is to minimize potential collision conflicts with marine event participants or race boats and spectator vessels or nearby transiting vessels. This zone provides separation between a Race Area or Marine Event Area and a specified Spectator Area or other vessels that are operating in the vicinity of the Special local regulated area for marine event.

(6) *Designated spectator area.* Spectators are only allowed inside the regulated area if they remain within a designated spectator area. Spectators shall contact the PATCOM to request permission to either enter the Spectator Area or pass through the regulated area. If permission is granted, spectators may enter the Spectator Area or must pass directly through the regulated area as instructed by PATCOM at safe speed and without loitering.

(d) *Contact information.* Questions about marine events should be addressed to the local Coast Guard Captain of the Port for the area in which the marine event is occurring.
