Appendix A to § 164.38—Performance Standards For Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA)1 Introduction

1.1 The Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) should, in order to improve the standard of collision avoidance at sea:

.1 Reduce the work-load of observers by enabling them to automatically obtain information so that they can perform as well with multiple targets as they can by manually plotting a single target; and

.2 Provide continuous, accurate and rapid situation evaluation.

1.2 In addition to the General Requirements for Electronic Navigational Aids ([IMO] Res. A.281(VII)), the ARPA should comply with the following minimum performance standards.

2 Definitions

2.1 Definitions of terms in these performance standards are given in Annex 1.

3 Performance Standards

3.1 *Detection*

3.1.1 Where a separate facility is provided for detection of targets, other than by the radar observer, it should have a performance not inferior to that which could be obtained by the use of the radar display.

3.2 *Acquisition*

3.2.1 Target acquisition may be manual or automatic. However, there should always be a facility to provide for manual acquisition and cancellation. ARPA with automatic acquisition should have a facility to suppress acquisition in certain areas. On any range scale where acquisition is suppressed over a certain area, the area of acquisition should be indicated on the display.

3.2.2 Automatic or manual acquisition should have a performance not inferior to that which could be obtained by the user of the radar display.

3.3 *Tracking*

3.3.1 The ARPA should be able to automatically track, process, simultaneously display and continuously update the information on at least:

.1 20 targets, if automatic acquisition is provided, whether automatically or manually acquired; or

.2 10 targets, if only manual acquisition is provided.

3.3.2 If automatic acquisition is provided, description of the criteria of selection of targets for tracking should be provided to the user. If the ARPA does not track all targets visible on the display, targets which are being tracked should be clearly indicated on the display. The reliability of tracking should not be less than that obtainable using manual recording of successive target positions obtained from the radar display.

3.3.3 Provided the target is not subject to target swop, the ARPA should continue to track an acquired target which is clearly distinguishable on the display for 5 out of 10 consecutive scans.

3.3.4 The possibility of tracking errors, including target swop, should be minimized by ARPA design. A qualitative description of the effects of error sources on the automatic tracking and corresponding errors should be provided to the user, including the effects of low signal to noise and low signal to clutter ratios caused by sea returns, rain, snow, low clouds and non-synchronous emission.

3.3.5 The ARPA should be able to display on request at least four equally time-spaced past positions of any targets being tracked over a period of at least eight minutes.

3.4 *Display*

3.4.1 The Display may be a separate or integral part of the ship's radar. However, the ARPA display should include all the data required to be provided by a radar display in accordance with the performance standards for navigational radar equipment adopted by the Organization.

3.4.2 The design should be such that any malfunction of ARPA parts producing information additional to information to be produced by the radar as required by the performance standards for navigational equipment adopted by IMO should not affect the integrity of the basic radar presentation.

3.4.3 The display on which ARPA information is presented should have an effective diameter of at least 340 mm.

3.4.4 The ARPA facilities should be available on at least the following range scales:

.1 12 or 16 miles;

.2 3 or 4 miles.

3.4.5 There should be a positive indication of the range scale in use.

3.4.6 The ARPA should be capable of operating with a relative motion display with “north-up” and either “head-up” or “course-up” azimuth stabilization. In addition, the ARPA may also provide for a true motion display. If true motion is provided, the operator should be able to select for his display either true or relative motion. There should be a positive indication of the display mode and orientation in use.

3.4.7 The course and speed information generated by the ARPA for acquired targets should be displayed in a vector or graphic form which clearly indicates the target's predicted motion. In this regard:

.1 ARPA presenting predicted information in vector form only should have the option of both true and relative vectors;

.2 An ARPA which is capable of presenting target course and speed information in graphic form, should also, on request, provide the target's true and/or relative vector;

.3 Vectors displayed should be either time adjustable or have a fixed time-scale;

.4 A positive indication of the time-scale of the vector in use should be given.

3.4.8 The ARPA information should not obscure radar information in such a manner as to degrade the process of detecting targets. The display of ARPA data should be under the control of the radar observer. It should be possible to cancel the display of unwanted ARPA data.

3.4.9 Means should be provided to adjust independently the brilliance of the ARPA data and radar data, including complete elimination of the ARPA data.

3.4.10 The method of presentation should ensure that the ARPA data is clearly visible in general to more than one observer in the conditions of light normally experienced on the bridge of a ship by day and by night. Screening may be provided to shade the display from sunlight but not to the extent that it will impair the observer's ability to maintain a proper lookout. Facilities to adjust the brightness should be provided.

3.4.11 Provisions should be made to obtain quickly the range and bearing of any object which appears on the ARPA display.

3.4.12 When a target appears on the radar display and, in the case of automatic acquisition, enters within the acquisition area chosen by the observer or, in the case of manual acquisition, has been acquired by the observer, the ARPA should present in a period of not more than one minute an indication of the target's motion trend and display within three minutes the target's predicted motion in accordance with paragraphs 3.4.7, 3.6, 3.8.2 and 3.8.3.

3.4.13 After changing range scales on which the ARPA facilities are available or resetting the display, full plotting information should be displayed within a period of time not exceeding four scans.

3.5 *Operational Warnings*

3.5.1 The ARPA should have the capability to warn the observer with a visual and/or audible signal of any distinguishable target which closes to a range or transits a zone chosen by the observer. The target causing the warning should be clearly indicated on the display.

3.5.2 The ARPA should have the capability to warn the observer with a visual and/or audible signal of any tracked target which is predicted to close to within a minimum range and time chosen by the observer. The target causing the warning should be clearly indicated on the display.

3.5.3 The ARPA should clearly indicate if a tracked target is lost, other than out of range, and the target's last tracked position should be clearly indicated on the display.

3.5.4 It should be possible to activate or de-activate the operational warnings.

3.6 *Data Requirements*

3.6.1 At the request of the observer the following information should be immediately available from the ARPA in alphanumeric form in regard to any tracked target:

1. Present range to the target;2. Present bearing of the target;..3 Predicted target range at the closest point of approach (CPA);.4 Predicted time to CPA (TCPA);.5 Calculated true course of target;.6 Calculated true speed of target.

3.7 *Trial Manoeuvre*

3.7.1 The ARPA should be capable of simulating the effect on all tracked targets of an own ship manoeuvre without interrupting the updating of target information. The simulation should be initiated by the depression either of a spring-loaded switch, or of a function key, with a positive identification on the display.

3.8 *Accuracy*

3.8.1 The ARPA should provide accuracies not less than those given in paragraphs 3.8.2 and 3.8.3 for the four scenarios defined in Annex 2. With the sensor errors specified in Annex 3, the values given relate to the best possible manual plotting performance under environmental conditions of plus and minus ten degrees of roll.

3.8.2 An ARPA should present within one minute of steady state tracking the relative motion trend of a target with the following accuracy values (95 percent probability values):

|Scenario/data|Relative course (degrees)|Relative speed (Knots)|CPA (n.m.)|
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------|

|      3      |           14            |         2.2          |   1.8    |
|      4      |           15            |         1.5          |   2.0    |

3.8.3 An ARPA should present within three minutes of steady state tracking the motion of a target with the following accuracy values (95 percent probability values):

|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|------------------|
|      1      |           3.0           |         0.8          |     0.5     |    1.0    |         7.5         |       1.2        |
|      2      |           2.3           |          .3          |             |           |         2.9         |        .8        |
|      3      |           4.4           |          .9          |     .7      |    1.0    |         3.3         |       1.0        |
|      4      |           4.6           |          .8          |     .7      |    1.0    |         2.6         |       1.2        |

3.8.4 When a tracked target, or own ship, has completed a manoeuvre, the system should present in a period of not more than one minute an indication of the target's motion trend, and display within three minutes the target's predicted motion in accordance with paragraphs 3.4.7, 3.6, 3.8.2 and 3.8.3

3.8.5 The ARPA should be designed in such a manner that under the most favorable conditions of own ship motion the error contribution from the ARPA should remain insignificant compared to the errors associated with the input sensors, for scenarios of Annex 2.

3.9 *Connections with other equipment*

3.9.1 The ARPA should not degrade the performance of any equipment providing sensor inputs. The connection of the ARPA to any other equipment should not degrade the performance of that equipment.

3.10 *Performance test and warnings*

3.10.1 The ARPA should provide suitable warnings of ARPA malfunction to enable the observer to monitor the proper operation of the system. Additionally test programmes should be available so that the overall performance of ARPA can be assessed periodically against a known solution.

3.11 *Equipment used with ARPA*

Appendix B to § 164.38—U.S. Maritime Administration Collision Avoidance System Specification

A collision system designed as a supplement to both surface search navigational radars via interswitching shall be installed. The system shall provide unattended monitoring of all radar echoes and automatic audio and visual alarm signals that will alert the watch officer of a possible threat. The display shall be contained within a console capable of being installed adjacent to the radar displays in the wheelhouse and may form a part of the bridge console.

Provision for signal input from the ship's radars, gyro compass, and speed log, without modification to these equipments shall be made. The collision avoidance system, whether operating normally or having failed, must not introduce any spurious signals or otherwise degrade the performance of the radars, the gyro compass or the speed log.

Computer generated display data for each acquired target shall be in the form of a line or vector indicating true or relative target course, speed and both present and extrapolated future positions. Data shall be automatically displayed on a cathode ray tube or other suitable display contrivance sufficiently bright and unobstructed to permit viewing by more than one person at a time.

In addition to displaying the collision potential of the most threatening fixed and moving targets, the system shall be capable of simultaneously showing land masses.

The system display shall include a heading indication and bearing ring. The system shall also have the capability of allowing the operator to select “head-up” and to cancel the vector or line presentation of any of the targets. The presentation shall be non-smearing when changing modes or display scales in order to permit rapid evaluation of the displayed data.

Target acquisition, for display data purposes, may be manual, automatic or both, as specified by Owner.

For any manual acquisition system the alarms shall be initiated by a preset minimum range; and likewise for any automatic acquisition system the alarms shall be initiated by a preset minimum acceptable passing distance (CPA—Closest Point of Approach) and a preset advance warning time (TCPA—Time to Closest Point of Approach). Means shall be provided to silence the audio alarm for a given threat but the alarm shall resound upon a subsequent threat. The visual alarm shall continue to operate until all threats have been eliminated. If the collision avoidance system fails to perform as indicated above, after the system is set for unattended monitoring, the system shall produce both audio and visual warning alarms.

The system shall be capable of simulating a trial maneuver.

In addition to the target display, an alpha-numeric readout shall be provided which can present range, bearing, course, speed, CPA and TCPA for any selected target, either on the target display or by other display means.

The collision avoidance system shall be energized from the interior communications panel board in the wheelhouse.

The collision avoidance function may be incorporated in an integrated conning system, provided that failure of any other integrated system component will not degrade the collision avoidance function.
