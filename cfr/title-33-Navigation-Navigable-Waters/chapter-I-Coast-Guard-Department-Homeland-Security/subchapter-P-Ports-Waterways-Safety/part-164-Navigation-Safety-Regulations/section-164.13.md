##### § 164.13 Navigation underway: tankers. #####

(a) As used in this section, “tanker” means a self-propelled tank vessel, including integrated tug barge combinations, constructed or adapted primarily to carry oil or hazardous material in bulk in the cargo spaces and inspected and certificated as a tanker.

(b) Each tanker must have an engineering watch capable of monitoring the propulsion system, communicating with the bridge, and implementing manual control measures immediately when necessary. The watch must be physically present in the machinery spaces or in the main control space and must consist of at least an engineer with an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential.

(c) Each tanker must navigate with at least two deck officers with an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential on watch on the bridge, one of whom may be a pilot. In waters where a pilot is required, the second officer, must be an individual holding an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential and assigned to the vessel as master, mate, or officer in charge of a navigational watch, who is separate and distinct from the pilot.

(d) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, a tanker may operate with an auto pilot engaged only if all of the following conditions exist:

(1) The operation and performance of the automatic pilot conforms with the standards recommended by the International Maritime Organization in IMO Resolution A.342(IX).

(2) A qualified helmsman is present at the helm and prepared at all times to assume manual control.

(3) The tanker is not operating in any of the following areas:

(i) The areas of the traffic separation schemes specified in subchapter P of this chapter.

(ii) The portions of a shipping safety fairway specified in part 166 of this chapter.

(iii) An anchorage ground specified in part 110 of this chapter.

(iv) An area within one-half nautical mile of any U.S. shore.

(e) A tanker equipped with an integrated navigation system, and complying with paragraph (d)(2) of this section, may use the system with the auto pilot engaged while in the areas described in paragraphs (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section. The master shall provide, upon request, documentation showing that the integrated navigation system -

(1) Can maintain a predetermined trackline with a cross track error of less than 10 meters 95 percent of the time;

(2) Provides continuous position data accurate to within 20 meters 95 percent of the time; and

(3) Has an immediate override control.
