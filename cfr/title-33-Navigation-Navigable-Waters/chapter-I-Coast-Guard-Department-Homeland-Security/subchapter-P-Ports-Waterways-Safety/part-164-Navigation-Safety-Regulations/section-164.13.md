(a) As used in this section, “tanker” means a self-propelled tank vessel, including integrated tug barge combinations, constructed or adapted primarily to carry oil or hazardous material in bulk in the cargo spaces and inspected and certificated as a tanker.

(b) Each tanker must have an engineering watch capable of monitoring the propulsion system, communicating with the bridge, and implementing manual control measures immediately when necessary. The watch must be physically present in the machinery spaces or in the main control space and must consist of at least an engineer with an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential.

(c) Each tanker must navigate with at least two deck officers with an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential on watch on the bridge, one of whom may be a pilot. In waters where a pilot is required, the second officer, must be an individual holding an appropriately endorsed license or merchant mariner credential and assigned to the vessel as master, mate, or officer in charge of a navigational watch, who is separate and distinct from the pilot.

(d) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, a tanker may operate with an auto pilot engaged only if all of the following conditions exist:

The master shall provide, upon request, documentation showing that the integrated navigation system -

(1) Can maintain a predetermined trackline with a cross track error of less than 10 meters 95 percent of the time;
