(International Boundary Range C Rear Light). This area includes: Puget Sound, Hood Canal, Possession Sound, the San Juan Island Archipelago, Rosario Strait, Guemes Channel, Bellingham Bay, the U.S. waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Strait of Georgia, and all waters adjacent to the above.

(a) Vessel Traffic Service Puget Sound participates in a U.S./Canadian Cooperative Vessel Traffic Service (CVTS) to jointly manage vessel traffic in the Juan de Fuca Region. The CVTS for the Juan de Fuca Region consists of all waters of the Strait of Juan de Fuca and its offshore approaches, southern Georgia Strait, the Gulf and San Juan Archipelagos, Rosario Strait, Boundary Pass and Haro Strait, bounded on the northwest by 48°35′45″ N.; and on the southwest by 48°23′30″ N.; and on the west by the rhumb line joining 48°35′45″ N., 124°47′30″ W. with 48°23′30″ N., 124°48′37″ W.; and on the northeast in the Strait of Georgia, by a line drawn along 49° N. from Vancouver Island to Semiahmoo Bay; and on the southeast, by a line drawn from McCurdy Point on the Quimper Peninsula to Point Partridge on Whidbey Island. Canadian and United States Vessel Traffic Centers (Tofino, B.C., Canada, Vancouver, BC, Canada and Seattle, WA) manage traffic within the CVTS area irrespective of the International Boundary.

(b) VTS Special Area: The Eastern San Juan Island Archipelago VTS Special Area consists of all waters of the eastern San Juan Island Archipelago including: Rosario Strait bounded to the south by latitude 48°26.40′ N.
