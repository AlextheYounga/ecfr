Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 58188, Nov. 19, 2018.

(a) *Regulations.* (1) The general regulations contained in 33 CFR 165.23 apply.

(2) This section applies to the fireworks safety zones listed in the Table to § 165.506. These regulations will be enforced annually, for the duration of each fireworks event listed in the Table to § 165.506. In the case of inclement weather, the event may be conducted on the day following the date listed in the Table to § 165.506. Annual notice of the exact dates and times of the enforcement period of the regulation with respect to each safety zone, the geographical area, and other details concerning the nature of the fireworks event will be published in Local Notices to Mariners and via Broadcast Notice to Mariners over VHF-FM marine band radio.

(3) All persons and vessels shall comply with the instructions of the Coast Guard Captain of the Port, the Coast Guard Patrol Commander, or the designated on-scene-patrol personnel. Those personnel are comprised of commissioned, warrant, and petty officers of the U.S. Coast Guard. Other Federal, State, and local agencies may assist these personnel in the enforcement of the safety zone. Upon being hailed by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel by siren, radio, flashing light or other means, the operator of a vessel shall proceed as directed.

(b) *Notification.* (1) Fireworks barges and launch sites on land that operate within the regulated areas contained in the Table to § 165.506 will have a sign affixed to the port and starboard side of the barge or mounted on a post 3 feet above ground level when on land immediately adjacent to the shoreline and facing the water labeled “FIREWORKS - DANGER - STAY AWAY”. This will provide on-scene notice that the safety zone will be enforced on that day. This notice will consist of a diamond shaped sign 4 feet by 4 feet with a 3-inch orange retro reflective border. The word “DANGER” shall be 10 inch black block letters centered on the sign with the words “FIREWORKS” and “STAY AWAY” in 6 inch black block letters placed above and below the word “DANGER” respectively on a white background.

(2) Coast Guard Captains of the Port in the Fifth Coast Guard District will notify the public of the enforcement of these safety zones by all appropriate means to affect the widest publicity among the affected segments of the public. Publication in the Local Notice to Mariners, Marine information broadcasts, and facsimile broadcasts may be made for these events, beginning 24 to 48 hours before the event is scheduled to begin, to notify the public.

(c) *Contact information.* Questions about safety zones and related events should be addressed to the local Coast Guard Captain of the Port for the area in which the event is occurring. Contact information is listed below. For a description of the geographical area of each Coast Guard Sector - Captain of the Port zone, please see 33 CFR 3.25.

(1) Coast Guard Sector Delaware Bay - Captain of the Port Zone, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: (215) 271-4940.

(2) Coast Guard Sector Maryland-National Capital Region - Captain of the Port Zone, Baltimore, Maryland: (410) 576-2525.

(3) Coast Guard Sector Hampton Roads - Captain of the Port Zone, Norfolk, Virginia: (757) 483-8567.

(4) Coast Guard Sector North Carolina - Captain of the Port Zone, Wilmington, North Carolina: (877) 229-0770 or (910) 362-4015.

(d) *Enforcement periods.* The safety zones in the Table to § 165.506 will be enforced from 5:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. each day a barge with a “FIREWORKS - DANGER - STAY AWAY” sign on the port and starboard side is on-scene or a “FIREWORKS - DANGER - STAY AWAY” sign is posted on land adjacent to the shoreline, in a location listed in the Table to § 165.506. Vessels may not enter, remain in, or transit through the safety zones during these enforcement periods unless authorized by the Captain of the Port or designated Coast Guard patrol personnel on scene. The enforcement periods for each Safety Zone in the Table to § 165.506 of this section are subject to change, but the duration of enforcement would remain the same or nearly the same total amount of time as stated in its table. In the event of a change, or for enforcement periods listed that do not allow a specific date or dates to be determined, the Captain of the Port will provide notice by publishing a Notice of Enforcement in the Federal Register, as well as issuing a Broadcast Notice to Mariners.
