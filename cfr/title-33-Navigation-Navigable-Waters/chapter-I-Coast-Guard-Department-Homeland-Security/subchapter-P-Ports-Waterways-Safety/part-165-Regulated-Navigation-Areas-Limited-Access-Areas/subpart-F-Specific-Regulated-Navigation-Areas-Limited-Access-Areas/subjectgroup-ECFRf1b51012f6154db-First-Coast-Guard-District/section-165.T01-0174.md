(1) Western RNA: all waters bound by the following approximate positions: 41°04′39.16″ N, 073°55′00.68″ W on the western shoreline; thence to 41°04′28.34″ N, 073°54′47.18″ W; thence to 41°04′11.28″ N, 073°54′48.00″ W; thence to 41°03′57.26″ N, 073°54′40.73″ W; thence to 41°03′57.36″ N, 073°54′47.38″ W; thence to 41°03′58.66″ N, 073°54′56.14″ W; thence to 41°04′03.00″ N, 073°55′07.60″ W; thence to a point on the western shoreline at 41°04′06.69″ N, 073°55′14.10″ W; thence northerly along the shoreline to the point of origin (NAD 83).

(2) Eastern RNA: all waters bound by the following approximate positions: 41°04′21.96″ N, 073°52′03.25″ W on the eastern shoreline; thence to 41°04′26.27″ N, 073°52′19.82″ W; thence to 41°04′26.53″ N, 073°53′20.07″ W; thence to 41°03′56.92″ N, 073°53′18.84″ W; thence to 41°03′56.69″ N, 073°52′24.75″ W; thence to a point on the eastern shoreline at 41°03′46.91″ N, 073°52′05.89″ W; thence northerly along the shoreline to the point of origin (NAD 83).

(b) *Safety Zone boundaries.* The following is a Safety Zone: all waters bound by the following approximate positions: 41°04′59.70″ N, 073°54′45.54″ W; thence to 41°05′00.18″ N, 073°53′21.48″ W; thence to 41°03′09.24″ N, 073°53′16.86″ W; thence to 41°03′07.08″ N, 073°54′14.70″ W; thence to 41°04′11.28″ N, 073°54′48.00″ W; thence to the point of origin (NAD 83).

(c) *Regulations.* (1) The general regulations contained in 33 CFR 165.10, 165.11, and 165.13, 165.20 and 165.23 apply.

(2) Any vessel transiting through the Western RNA must make a direct and expeditious passage. No vessel may stop, moor, anchor or loiter within the RNA at any time unless they are working on the bridge construction operations.

(3) Any vessel transiting through the Eastern RNA must make a direct and expeditious passage. No vessel may stop, moor, anchor or loiter within the RNA at any time unless they are working on the bridge construction operations or they are transiting to, or from, the special anchorage area codified in 33 CFR 110.60(c)(8) located on the eastern shoreline at Tarrytown, NY and within the boundaries of the RNA.

(4) Entry and movement within the Eastern RNA or Western RNA is subject to a “Slow-No Wake” speed limit. All vessels may not produce a wake and may not attain speeds greater than five knots unless a higher minimum speed is necessary to maintain steerageway. All vessels must proceed through the Eastern RNA and Western RNA with caution and operate in such a manner as to produce no wake.

(5) Entry into, anchoring, loitering, or movement within the Safety Zone is prohibited unless the vessel is working on the bridge construction operations or authorized by the Captain of the Port New York (COTP) or his designated representative.

(6) All persons and vessels must comply with all orders and directions from the COTP or the COTP's designated representative. The “designated representative” of the COTP is any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant or petty officer who has been designated by the COTP to act on the COTP's behalf. The designated representative may be on a Coast Guard vessel or New York State Police, Westchester County Police, Rockland County Police, or other designated craft; or may be on shore and will communicate with vessels via VHF-FM radio or loudhailer. Members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary may be present to inform vessel operators of this regulation.

(7) Upon being hailed by a Coast Guard vessel by siren, radio, flashing light or other means, the operator of the vessel must proceed as directed.

(8) For the purpose of this regulation, the Federal navigation channel, located in the Eastern RNA is marked by the red and green navigation lights on the existing Tappan Zee Bridge, and the New NY Bridge. As the project progresses, the Federal navigation channel will be intermittently closed, or partially restricted, to all vessel transits. While the Federal navigation channel is closed, vessels that can safely navigate outside the Federal navigation channel would still be able to transit through the Eastern RNA. These closures or partial restrictions are tentatively scheduled to take place between March 2015 and October 2016. The COTP will cause a notice of the channel closure or restrictions by appropriate means to the affected segments of the public. Such means of notification may include, but are not limited to, Broadcast Notice to Mariners and Local Notice to Mariners.

(9) Notwithstanding anything contained in this section, the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR subchapter E) are still in effect and must be strictly adhered to at all times.

(d) *Enforcement periods.* This regulation will be enforced 24 hours a day from 5:00 a.m. on July 3, 2014 until 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2018.

(1) Notice of suspension of enforcement: If enforcement is suspended, the COTP will cause a notice of the suspension of enforcement by appropriate means to the affected segments of the public. Such means of notification may include, but are not limited to, Broadcast Notice to Mariners and Local Notice to Mariners. Such notification will include the date and time that enforcement will be suspended as well as the date and time that enforcement will resume.

(2) Violations of this regulation may be reported to the COTP at 718-354-4353 or on VHF-Channel 16.

Effective Date Note:By USCG-2013-0705, 79 FR 43254, July 25, 2014, as amended by USCG-2015-0433, 80 FR 44282, July 27, 2015, temporary § 165.T01-0174 was revised, effective from July 25, 2014, until Dec. 31, 2018.
