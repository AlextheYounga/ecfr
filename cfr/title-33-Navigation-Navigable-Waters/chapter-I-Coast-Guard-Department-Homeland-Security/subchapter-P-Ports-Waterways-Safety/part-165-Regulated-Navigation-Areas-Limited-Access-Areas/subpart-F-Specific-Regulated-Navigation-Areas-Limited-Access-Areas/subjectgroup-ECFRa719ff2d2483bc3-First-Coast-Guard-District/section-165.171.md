##### § 165.171 Safety Zones for fireworks displays and swim events held in Coast Guard Sector Northern New England Captain of the Port Zone. #####

The Coast Guard is establishing safety zones for the fireworks displays listed in the Table 1 to § 165.171. These regulations will be enforced for the duration of each event, on or about the dates indicated in the Table 1 to § 165.171. Mariners should consult their Local Notice to Mariners to remain apprised of the specific calendar date upon which the listed event falls for each calendar year and other specific information concerning the event. First Coast Guard District Local Notice to Mariners can be found at: *http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/.* The Sector Northern New England Marine Events schedule can also be viewed electronically at *www.homeport.uscg.mil.*

Note to introductory text of § 165.171:

Although listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, sponsors of events listed in the Table to § 165.171 shall submit an application each year in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15.

(a) The Coast Guard may patrol each event area under the direction of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander. The Patrol Commander may be contacted on Channel 16 VHF-FM (156.8 MHz) by the call sign “PATCOM.” The “official patrol vessels” may consist of any Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, state, or local law enforcement vessels assigned or approved by the Captain of the Port, Sector Northern New England.

(b) Vessels may not transit the regulated areas without Patrol Commander approval. Vessels permitted to transit must operate at a no wake speed, in a manner which will not endanger participants or other crafts in the event.

(c) Spectators or other vessels shall not anchor, block, loiter, or impede the movement of event participants or official patrol vessels in the regulated areas during the effective dates and times, or dates and times as modified through the Local Notice to Mariners, unless authorized by an official patrol vessel.

(d) The Patrol Commander may control the movement of all vessels in the regulated area. When hailed or signaled by an official patrol vessel, a vessel shall come to an immediate stop and comply with the lawful directions issued. Failure to comply with a lawful direction may result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or both.

(e) The Patrol Commander may delay or terminate any event in this subpart at any time to assure safety. Such action may be justified as a result of weather, traffic density, spectator operation or participant behavior.

(f) For all swim events listed, vessels not associated with the event shall maintain a separation zone of 200 feet from participating swimmers.

(g) For all fireworks displays listed below, the regulated area is that area of navigable waters within a 350 yard radius of the launch platform or launch site for each fireworks display.

(h) The specific calendar date upon which the listed event falls will be published in the Federal Register.
