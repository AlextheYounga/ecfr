(a) *Safety Zone.* (1) The following area is a safety zone: All waters of the *Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal* located between mile marker 296.1 and mile marker 296.7.

(2) *Regulations.* (i) All vessels are prohibited from transiting the safety zone with any non-potable water on board if they intend to release that water in any form within, or on the other side of the safety zone. Non-potable water includes, but is not limited to, any water taken on board to control or maintain trim, draft, stability, or stresses of the vessel. Likewise, it includes any water taken on board due to free communication between the hull of the vessel and exterior water. Potable water is water treated and stored aboard the vessel that is suitable for human consumption.

(ii) Vessels with non-potable water onboard are permitted to transit the safety zone if they have taken steps to prevent the release, in any form, of that water in or on the other side of the safety zone. Alternatively, vessels with non-potable water onboard are permitted to transit the safety zone if they have plans to dispose of the water in a biologically sound manner.

(iii) Vessels with non-potable water aboard that intend to discharge on the other side of the zone must contact the Coast Guard's Ninth District Commander or his or her designated representatives prior to transit and obtain permission to transit and discharge. Examples of discharges that may be approved include plans to dispose of the water in a biologically sound manner or demonstrate through testing that the non-potable water does not contain potential live Silver or Asian carp, viable eggs, or gametes.

(iv) In accordance with the general regulations in § 165.23 of this part, entry into, transiting, or anchoring within this safety zone by vessels with non-potable water on board is prohibited unless authorized by the Coast Guard's Ninth District Commander, his or her designated representatives, or an on-scene representative.

(v) The Captain of the Port, Sector Lake Michigan, may further designate an “on-scene” representative.
