##### § 128.307 What is the procedure for examination? #####

(a) Unless a plan for your passenger terminal will be submitted by an entity other than yourself under § 128.305 or § 120.303 of this chapter, you must submit two copies of each Terminal Security Plan required by § 128.300 to the COTP for examination at least 60 days before transferring passengers to or from a vessel subject to part 120 of this chapter.

(b) If the COTP finds that the Terminal Security Plan meets the requirements of § 128.300, he or she will return a copy to you marked “Examined by the Coast Guard.”

(c) If the COTP finds that the Terminal Security Plan does not meet the requirements of § 128.300, he or she will return the Plan with an explanation of why it does not meet them.

(d) No terminal subject to this part may transfer passengers to or from a passenger vessel subject to part 120 of this chapter, unless it holds either a Terminal Security Plan that we have examined or a letter from the COTP stating that we are currently reviewing the Plan and that normal operations may continue until the COTP has determined whether the Plan meets the requirements of § 128.300.
