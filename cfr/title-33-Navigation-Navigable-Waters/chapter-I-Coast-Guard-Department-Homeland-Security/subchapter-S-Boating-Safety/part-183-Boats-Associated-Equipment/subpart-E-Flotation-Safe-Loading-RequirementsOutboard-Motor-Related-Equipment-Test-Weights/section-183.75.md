|<sup>1</sup> Dry weight is the manufacturer's published weight for the shortest midsection increased by 10 percent to account for longer midsections and additional required hardware usually not included in published weights. This weight is intended to represent the heaviest model in each power category. For boats designed with a transom height of 20 inches or less, the weight in Column 2 may be reduced by 10 percent.
