##### § 187.307 What are dealer and manufacturer provisions? #####

A State must include the following provisions applicable to any dealer or manufacturer building, buying, acquiring, selling, or transferring a vessel in that State:

(a) Dealers or manufacturers must not be allowed to apply for a certificate of title for a vessel not required to be numbered. Dealers or manufacturers owning a new or used vessel primarily used in their business, held for sale or lease, and required to be numbered may be permitted or required to apply for a certificate of title for the vessel. The State may impose other reporting requirements on dealers or manufacturers.

(b) Dealers or manufacturers transferring a vessel required to be titled in the name of the dealer or manufacturer must be required to assign the title to the new owner or, for a new vessel, assign a COO for a new vessel. Dealers or manufacturers transferring a vessel permitted to be titled in their name must be required to assign to the new owner any certificate of title which has been issued and not surrendered.

(c) Dealers or manufacturers must not be permitted to provide a redundant COO if VIS contains information concerning the vessel.

(d) Dealers or manufacturers must be permitted to provide a redundant COO to the vessel owner only upon receipt of information concerning the original certificate and the circumstances of its loss, theft, mutilation, or destruction and receipt of any recovered original COO or remains from the vessel owner. This information must be declared under penalty of perjury or similar penalties as prescribed by State law. The term “REDUNDANT” must be clearly and permanently marked on the face of a redundant COO.

(e) Dealers or manufacturers must be required to maintain for at least 3 years a record of any vessel bought, sold, exchanged, or received for sale or exchange, and open such records for inspection by the State.
