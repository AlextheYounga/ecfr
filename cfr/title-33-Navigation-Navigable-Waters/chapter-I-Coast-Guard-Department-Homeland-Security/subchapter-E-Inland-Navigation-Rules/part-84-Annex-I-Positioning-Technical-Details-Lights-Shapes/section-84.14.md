##### § 84.14 Intensity of lights. #####

(a) The minimum luminous intensity of lights shall be calculated by using the formula:

I = 3.43 × 106 × T × D2 × K−DWhere:I is luminous intensity in candelas under service conditions,T is threshold factor 2 × 10−7lux,D is range of visibility (luminous range) of the light in nautical miles,K is atmospheric transmissivity. For prescribed lights the value of K shall be 0.8, corresponding to a meteorological visibility of approximately 13 nautical miles.

(b) A selection of figures derived from the formula is given in the following table (Table 84.14(b)):

|Range of visibility  <br/>(luminous range) of light  <br/>in nautical miles D|Minimum luminous intensity of light in candelas for K = 0.8 I|
