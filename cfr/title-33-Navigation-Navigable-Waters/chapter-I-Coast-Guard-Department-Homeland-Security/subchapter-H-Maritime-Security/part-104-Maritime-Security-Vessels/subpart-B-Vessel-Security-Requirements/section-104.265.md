Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 57711, Aug. 23, 2016.

(a) *General.* The vessel owner or operator must ensure the implementation of security measures to:

(1) Deter the unauthorized introduction of dangerous substances and devices, including any device intended to damage or destroy persons, vessels, facilities, or ports;

(2) Secure dangerous substances and devices that are authorized by the owner or operator to be on board;

(3) Control access to the vessel; and

(4) Prevent an unescorted individual from entering an area of the vessel that is designated as a secure area unless the individual holds a duly issued TWIC and is authorized to be in the area.

(b) The vessel owner or operator must ensure that the following are specified:

(1) The locations providing means of access to the vessel where access restrictions or prohibitions are applied for each Maritime Security (MARSEC) Level, including those points where TWIC access control provisions will be applied. “Means of access” include, but are not limited, to all:

(i) Access ladders;

(ii) Access gangways;

(iii) Access ramps;

(iv) Access doors, side scuttles, windows, and ports;

(v) Mooring lines and anchor chains; and

(vi) Cranes and hoisting gear;

(2) The identification of the types of restriction or prohibition to be applied and the means of enforcing them;

(3) The means used to establish the identity of individuals not in possession of a TWIC and procedures for escorting, in accordance with § 101.515 of this subchapter; and

(4) Procedures for identifying authorized and unauthorized persons at any MARSEC level.

(c) The vessel owner or operator must ensure that a TWIC program is implemented as follows:

(1) All persons seeking unescorted access to secure areas must present their TWIC for inspection before being allowed unescorted access, in accordance with § 101.514 of this subchapter. Inspection must include:

(i) A match of the photo on the TWIC to the individual presenting the TWIC;

(ii) Verification that the TWIC has not expired; and

(iii) A visual check of the various security features present on the card to determine whether the TWIC has been tampered with or forged.

(2) If an individual cannot present a TWIC because it has been lost, damaged or stolen, and he or she has previously been granted unescorted access to the vessel and is known to have had a valid TWIC, the individual may be given unescorted access to secure areas for a period of no longer than seven consecutive calendar days provided that:

(i) The individual has reported the TWIC as lost, damaged, or stolen to TSA as required in 49 CFR 1572.19(f);

(ii) The individual can present another identification credential that meets the requirements of § 101.515 of this subchapter; and

(iii) There are no other suspicious circumstances associated with the individual's claim of loss or theft.

(3) If an individual cannot present his or her TWIC for any other reason than outlined in paragraph (2) of this section, he or she may not be granted unescorted access to the secure area. The individual must be under escort, as that term is defined in part 101 of this subchapter, at all times when inside a secure area.

(4) With the exception of persons granted access according to paragraph (2) of this section, all persons granted unescorted access to secure areas of the vessel must be able to produce his or her TWIC upon request.

(5) There must be disciplinary measures in place to prevent fraud and abuse.

(6) The vessel's TWIC program should be coordinated, when practicable, with identification and TWIC access control measures of facilities or other transportation conveyances that interface with the vessel.

(d) If the vessel owner or operator uses a separate identification system, ensure that it complies and is coordinated with TWIC provisions in this part.

(e) The vessel owner or operator must establish in the approved VSP the frequency of application of any security measures for access control, particularly if these security measures are applied on a random or occasional basis.

(f) *MARSEC Level 1.* The vessel owner or operator must ensure security measures in this paragraph are implemented to:

(1) Employ TWIC as set out in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) Screen persons, baggage (including carry-on items), personal effects, and vehicles for dangerous substances and devices at the rate specified in the approved VSP, except for government-owned vehicles on official business when government personnel present identification credentials for entry;

(3) Conspicuously post signs that describe security measures currently in effect and clearly state that:

(i) Boarding the vessel is deemed valid consent to screening or inspection; and

(ii) Failure to consent or submit to screening or inspection will result in denial or revocation of authorization to board;

(4) Check the identification of any person not holding a TWIC and seeking to board the vessel, including vessel passengers, vendors, personnel duly authorized by the cognizant government authorities, and visitors.

Any such incident must be reported in compliance with this part;

(6) Deter unauthorized access to the vessel;

(7) Identify access points that must be secured or attended to deter unauthorized access;

(8) Lock or otherwise prevent access to unattended spaces that adjoin areas to which passengers and visitors have access;

(9) Provide a designated area on board, within the secure area, or in liaison with a facility, for conducting inspections and screening of people, baggage (including carry-on items), personal effects, vehicles and the vehicle's contents;

(10) Ensure vessel personnel are not subjected to screening, of the person or of personal effects, by other vessel personnel, unless security clearly requires it;

(11) Conduct screening in a way that takes into full account individual human rights and preserves the individual's basic human dignity;

(17) Respond to the presence of unauthorized persons on board, including repelling unauthorized boarders.

(g) *MARSEC Level 2.* In addition to the security measures required for MARSEC Level 1 in this section, at MARSEC Level 2, the vessel owner or operator must ensure the implementation of additional security measures, as specified for MARSEC Level 2 in the approved VSP.
