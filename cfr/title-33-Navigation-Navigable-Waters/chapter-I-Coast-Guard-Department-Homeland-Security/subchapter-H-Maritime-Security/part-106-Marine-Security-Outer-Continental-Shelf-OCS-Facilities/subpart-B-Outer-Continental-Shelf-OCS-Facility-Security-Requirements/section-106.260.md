(1) Deter the unauthorized introduction of dangerous substances and devices, including any device intended to damage or destroy persons, vessels, or the OCS facility;

(2) Secure dangerous substances and devices that are authorized by the OCS facility owner or operator to be on board;

(3) Control access to the OCS facility; and

(4) Prevent an unescorted individual from entering the OCS facility unless the individual holds a duly issued TWIC and is authorized to be on the OCS facility.

(b) The OCS facility owner or operator must ensure that the following are specified:

(1) All locations providing means of access to the OCS facility where access restrictions or prohibitions are applied for each security level to prevent unauthorized access, including those points where TWIC access control procedures will be applied;

(2) The identification of the types of restriction or prohibition to be applied and the means of enforcing them;

(3) The means used to establish the identity of individuals not in possession of a TWIC and the means by which they will be allowed access to the OCS facility; and

(4) Procedures for identifying authorized and unauthorized persons at any MARSEC level.

(c) The OCS facility owner or operator must ensure that a TWIC program is implemented as follows:

(1) All persons seeking unescorted access to secure areas must present their TWIC for inspection before being allowed unescorted access, in accordance with ยง 101.514 of this subchapter. Inspection must include:

(i) A match of the photo on the TWIC to the individual presenting the TWIC;

(ii) Verification that the TWIC has not expired; and

(iii) A visual check of the various security features present on the card to determine whether the TWIC has been tampered with or forged.

(2) If an individual cannot present a TWIC because it has been lost, damaged or stolen, and he or she has previously been granted unescorted access to the facility and is known to have had a valid TWIC, the individual may be given unescorted access to secure areas for a period of no longer than seven consecutive calendar days if:

(i) The individual has reported the TWIC as lost, damaged or stolen to TSA as required in 49 CFR 1572.19(f);

(ii) The individual can present another identification credential that meets the requirements of ยง 101.515 of this subchapter; and

(iii) There are no other suspicious circumstances associated with the individual's claim of loss or theft.

(3) If an individual cannot present his or her TWIC for any other reason than outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, he or she may not be granted unescorted access to the secure area. The individual must be under escort, as that term is defined in part 101 of this subchapter, at all times when inside of a secure area.

(4) With the exception of persons granted access according to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all persons granted unescorted access to secure areas of the facility must be able to produce his or her TWIC upon request.

(5) There must be disciplinary measures in place to prevent fraud and abuse.

(6) The facility's TWIC program should be coordinated, when practicable, with identification and TWIC access control measures of vessels or other transportation conveyances that use the facility.

(d) If the OCS facility owner or operator uses a separate identification system, ensure that it is coordinated with identification and TWIC systems in place on vessels conducting operations with the OCS facility.

(e) The OCS facility owner or operator must establish in the approved Facility Security Plan (FSP) the frequency of application of any access controls, particularly if they are to be applied on a random or occasional basis.

(f) *MARSEC Level 1.* The OCS facility owner or operator must ensure the following security measures are implemented at the facility:

(1) Implement TWIC as set out in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) Screen persons and personal effects going aboard the OCS facility for dangerous substances and devices at the rate specified in the approved FSP;

(3) Conspicuously post signs that describe security measures currently in effect and clearly stating that:

(i) Boarding an OCS facility is deemed valid consent to screening or inspection; and

(ii) Failure to consent or submit to screening or inspection will result in denial or revocation of authorization to be on board;

(4) Check the identification of any person seeking to board the OCS facility, including OCS facility employees, passengers and crews of vessels interfacing with the OCS facility, vendors, and visitors and ensure that non-TWIC holders are denied unescorted access to the OCS facility;

(5) Deny or revoke a person's authorization to be on board if the person is unable or unwilling, upon the request of OCS facility personnel or a law enforcement officer, to establish his or her identity in accordance with this part or to account for his or her presence on board.

(6) Deter unauthorized access to the OCS facility;

(7) Identify access points that must be secured or attended to deter unauthorized access;

(8) Lock or otherwise prevent access to unattended spaces that adjoin areas to which OCS facility personnel and visitors have access;

(9) Ensure OCS facility personnel are not required to engage in or be subjected to screening, of the person or of personal effects, by other OCS facility personnel, unless security clearly requires it;

(10) Provide a designated secure area on board, or in liaison with a vessel interfacing with the OCS facility, for conducting inspections and screening of people and their personal effects; and

(11) Respond to the presence of unauthorized persons on board.

(g) *MARSEC Level 2.* In addition to the security measures required for MARSEC Level 1 in this section, at MARSEC Level 2, the OCS facility owner or operator must ensure the implementation of additional security measures, as specified for MARSEC Level 2 in the approved FSP.
