(2) Secure dangerous substances and devices that are authorized by the owner or operator to be on the facility;

(3) Control access to the facility; and

(4) Prevent an unescorted individual from entering an area of the facility that is designated as a secure area unless the individual holds a duly issued TWIC and is authorized to be in the area.

(b) The facility owner or operator must ensure that the following are specified:

(1) The locations where restrictions or prohibitions that prevent unauthorized access are applied for each MARSEC Level, including those points where TWIC access control provisions will be applied. Each location allowing means of access to the facility must be addressed;

(c) The facility owner or operator must ensure that a TWIC program is implemented as follows:

(1) All persons seeking unescorted access to secure areas must present their TWIC for inspection before being allowed unescorted access, in accordance with ยง 101.514 of this subchapter. Inspection must include:

(i) A match of the photo on the TWIC to the individual presenting the TWIC;

(ii) Verification that the TWIC has not expired; and

(iii) A visual check of the various security features present on the card to determine whether the TWIC has been tampered with or forged.

(2) If an individual cannot present a TWIC because it has been lost, damaged or stolen, and he or she has previously been granted unescorted access to the facility and is known to have had a valid TWIC, the individual may be given unescorted access to secure areas for a period of no longer than 7 consecutive calendar days if:

(i) The individual has reported the TWIC as lost, damaged, or stolen to TSA as required in 49 CFR 1572.19(f);

(ii) The individual can present another identification credential that meets the requirements of ยง 101.515 of this subchapter; and

The individual must be under escort, as that term is defined in part 101 of this subchapter, at all times when inside of a secure area.
