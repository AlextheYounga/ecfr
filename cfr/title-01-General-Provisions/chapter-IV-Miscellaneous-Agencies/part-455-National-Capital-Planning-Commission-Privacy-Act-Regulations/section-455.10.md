##### § 455.10 Fees. #####

(a) The Commission will not charge an individual for the costs of making a search for a record or the costs of reviewing the record. When the Commission makes a copy of a record as a necessary part of the process of disclosing the record to an individual, the Commission will not charge the individual for the cost of making that copy.

(b) If an individual requests the Commission to furnish him or her with a copy of the record (when a copy has not otherwise been made as a necessary part of the process of disclosing the record to the individual), the Commission will charge a fee of $0.25 per page (maximum per page dimension of 81/2 × 13 inches) to the extent that the request exceeds $5.00 in cost to the Commission. Requests not exceeding $5.00 in cost to the Commission will be met without cost to the requester.
