##### ยง 31.3402(l)-1 Determination and disclosure of marital status. #####

(a) *Determination of status by employer.* An employer in computing the tax to be deducted and withheld from an employee's wages paid after April 30, 1966, shall apply the applicable percentage method or wage bracket method withholding table (see section 3402 (a), (b), and (c) and the regulations thereunder) for the pertinent payroll period which relates to employees who are single persons, unless there is in effect with respect to such payment of wages a withholding exemption certificate furnished to the employer by the employee after March 15, 1966, indicating that the employee is married in which case the employer shall apply the applicable table relating to employees who are married persons.

(b) *Disclosure of status by employee.* (1) An employee shall be entitled to furnish the employer with a withholding exemption certificate indicating he is married only if, on the day of such furnishing, he is married (determined by application of the rules in paragraph (c) of this section). Thus, an employee who is contemplating marriage may not, prior to the actual marriage, furnish the employer with a withholding exemption certificate indicating that he is a married person.

(2) (i) If, on any day during the calendar year, the marital status (as determined by application of the rules in paragraph (c) of this section) of an employee who has in effect a withholding exemption certificate indicating that he is a married person, changes from married to single, the employee must within 10 days after the change occurs furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate indicating that the employee is a single person.

(ii) If an employee who has in effect a withholding exemption certificate indicating that he is a married person, is considered married solely because of the application of subparagraph (2)(ii) of paragraph (c) of this section, and his spouse died during the taxable year which precedes by 2 years the current taxable year, the employee must, on or before December 1 of the current taxable year, furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate indicating that he is a single person. Such certificate shall not, however become effective until the next calendar year (see paragraph (c) of ยง 31.3402(f)(3)-1).

(3) If, on any day during the calendar year, the marital status (as determined by application of the rules in paragraph (c) of this section) of an employee who has in effect a withholding exemption certificate indicating that he is a single person changes from single to married, the employee may furnish the employer with a new withholding exemption certificate indicating that the employee is a married person.

(c) *Determination of marital status.* For the purposes of section 3402(l)(2) and paragraph (b) of this section, the following rules shall be applied in determining whether an employee is a married person or a single person -

(1) An employee shall on any day be considered as a single person if -

(i) He is legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance, or

(ii) Either he or his spouse is, or on any preceding day within the same calendar year was, a nonresident alien.

(2) An employee shall on any day be considered as a married person if -

(i) His spouse (other than a spouse referred to in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) died within the portion of his taxable year which precedes such day, or

(ii) His spouse died during one of the two taxable years immediately preceding the current taxable year and, on the basis of facts existing at the beginning of such day, he reasonably expects, at the close of his taxable year, to be a surviving spouse as defined in section 2 and the regulations thereunder.
