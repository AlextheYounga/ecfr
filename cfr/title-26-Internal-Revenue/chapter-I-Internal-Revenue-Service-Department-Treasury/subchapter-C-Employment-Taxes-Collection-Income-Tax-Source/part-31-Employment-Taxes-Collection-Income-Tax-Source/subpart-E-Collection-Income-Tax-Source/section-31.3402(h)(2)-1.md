##### ยง 31.3402(h)(2)-1 Withholding on basis of annualized wages. #####

An employer may determine the amount of tax to be deducted and withheld upon a payment of wages to an employee by taking the following steps:

*Step 1.* Multiply the amount of the employee's wages for the payroll period by the number of such periods in the calendar year.

*Step 2.* Determine the amount of tax which would be required to be deducted and withheld upon the amount determined in Step 1 if that amount constituted the actual wages for the calendar year and the payroll period of the employee were an annual payroll period.

*Step 3.* Divide the amount of tax determined in Step 2 by the number of periods by which the employee's wages were multiplied in Step 1.

Example.On July 1, 1970, A, a single person who is on a weekly payroll period and claims one exemption, receives wages of $100 from X Co., his employer. X Co. multiplies the weekly wage of $100 by 52 weeks to determine an annual wage of $5,200. It then subtracts $650 for A's withholding exemption and arrives at a balance of $4,550. The applicable table in section 3402(a) for annual payroll periods indicates that the amount of tax to be withheld thereon is $376 plus $314.50 (17 percent of excess over $2,700), or a total of $690.50. The annual tax of $690.50, when divided by 52 to arrive at the portion thereof attributable to the weekly payroll period, equals $13.28. X Co. may, if it chooses, withhold $13.28 rather than the amount specified in section 3402 (a) or (c) for a weekly payroll period.[T.D. 7053, 35 FR 11627, July 21, 1970]
