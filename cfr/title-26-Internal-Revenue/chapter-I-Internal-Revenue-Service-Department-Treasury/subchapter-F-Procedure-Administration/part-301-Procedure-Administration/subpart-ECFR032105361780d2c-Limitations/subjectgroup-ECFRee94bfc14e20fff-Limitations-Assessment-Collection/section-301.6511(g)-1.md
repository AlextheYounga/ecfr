##### § 301.6511(g)-1 Special rule for partnership items of federally registered partnerships. #####

(a) *In general.* In the case of any tax imposed by subtitle A with respect to any person, the period for filing a claim for credit or refund of any overpayment attributable to any partnership item of a federally registered partnership shall not expire before the later of -

(1) The date which is 4 years after the date prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for filing the partnership return for the partnership taxable year in which the item arose, or

(2) If the taxpayer or a general partner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the partnership, as provided in § 301.6501(o)-2(d), consents to extend the period for assessing a deficiency attributable to the partnership item before the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the date 6 months after the expiration of the extension.

(b) *Limits on amount of credit or refund not applicable.* In the case of a claim for credit or refund of any income tax overpayment attributable to any partnership item of a federally registered partnership, the limitations provided in section 6511(b) (2) and (c) shall not apply if the claim is filed within the period described in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) *Special periods of limitation with respect to carryback of net operating loss, capital loss, etc.* The provisions of section 6511(g) must also be taken into account in applying the various special periods of limitation prescribed in section 6511(d). Thus, to the extent that a carryback is attributable to a partnership item of a federally registered partnership, the period for filing a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment attributable to that carryback shall not expire before the date determined under paragraph (a) of this section with respect to the partnership taxable year in which the item arose.

(d) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the terms “partnership item” and “federally registered partnership” have the same meaning as such terms have when used in section 6501(o), § 301.6501(o)-2(c), and § 301.6501(o)-3.

(e) *Effective date.* The provisions of this section are effective generally for partnership items arising in partnership taxable years beginning after December 31, 1978 and before September 4, 1982. This section shall not apply, however, to any partnership taxable year with respect to which the amendments made to Code section 6511(g) by section 402 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 are effective. See section 407(a)(3) of that Act.
