##### ยง 301.6226(f)-1 Scope of judicial review. #####

(a) *In general.* A court reviewing a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment has jurisdiction to determine all partnership items for the taxable year to which the notice relates and the proper allocation of such items among the partners. Thus, the review is not limited to the items adjusted in the notice. In addition, the court has jurisdiction in the partnership-level proceeding to determine any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. However, the court does not have jurisdiction in the partnership-level proceeding to consider any partner-level defenses to any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount that relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. See section 6230(c)(4) and ยง 301.6221-1(c) and (d).

(b) *Example.* The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.The Internal Revenue Service issues a notice of final partnership administrative adjustment with respect to Partnership ABC in which the only item adjusted is depreciation. A petition for judicial review of that notice is filed. During the judicial proceeding, a partner of ABC, in accordance with the applicable court rules, raises an issue relating to the treatment of intangible drilling costs. The court reviewing the notice has jurisdiction to determine the intangible drilling cost issue in addition to the depreciation issue.

(c) *Effective date.* This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see ยง 301.6226(f)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
