##### ยง 301.6096-2 Designation by individuals for taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1972 and beginning before January 1, 1973. #####

(a) *In general.* (1) For taxable years ending on or after December 31, 1972 and beginning before January 1, 1973, every individual (other than a non-resident alien) whose income tax liability, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, is one dollar or more, may, at his option, designate that one dollar shall be paid over to the Presidential Election Campaign Fund, referred to in ยง 301.6096-1 (a). Where in accordance with prior law, such a designation was made for the account of any candidate of any specified political party, or for a general account for all candidates for election to the offices of President and Vice President of the United States, such a designation shall be treated solely as a designation to such fund.

(2) In the case of a joint return of a husband and wife, each spouse may designate that one dollar be paid to the fund as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if the joint income tax liability of the husband and wife is two dollars or more.

(b) *Income tax liability.* For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the income tax liability of an individual for any taxable year is the amount of the tax imposed by chapter 1 on such individual for such taxable year (as shown on his return), reduced by the sum of the credits (as shown on his return).

(c) *Manner and time of designation.* (1) A designation under paragraph (a) of this section may be made with respect to any such taxable year at the time of the filing of the return of the tax imposed by chapter 1 for such taxable year. If such designation is made at the time of filing the original return for such year, it shall be made by the individual on the form furnished by the Internal Revenue Service for such purpose in accordance with the instructions applicable thereto.

(2) With respect to any taxable year ending on or after December 31, 1972 and beginning before January 1, 1973, for which no designation was made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a designation may be made on the form furnished by the Internal Revenue Service for such purpose, filed within 20 and one half months after the due date for the original return for such taxable year. In the case of a joint return where neither spouse made a designation or where only one spouse made a designation, a designation may be made, as provided in this subparagraph, by the spouse or spouses who had not previously made a designation.

(3) A designation once made, whether by an original return or otherwise, may not be revoked.
