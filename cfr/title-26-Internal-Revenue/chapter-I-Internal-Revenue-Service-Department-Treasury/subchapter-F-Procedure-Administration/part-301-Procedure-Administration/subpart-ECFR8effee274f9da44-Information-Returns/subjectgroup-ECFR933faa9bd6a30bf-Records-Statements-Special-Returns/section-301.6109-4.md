##### ยง 301.6109-4 IRS truncated taxpayer identification numbers. #####

(a) *In general* - *Definition.* An IRS truncated taxpayer identification number (TTIN) is an individual's social security number (SSN), IRS individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), IRS adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or IRS employer identification number (EIN) in which the first five digits of the nine-digit number are replaced with Xs or asterisks. The TTIN takes the same format of the identifying number it replaces, for example XXX-XX-1234 when replacing an SSN, or XX-XXX1234 when replacing an EIN.

(b) *Use of a TTIN.* (1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a TTIN may be used to identify any person on any statement or other document that the internal revenue laws require to be furnished to another person. Use of a TTIN is permissive and not mandatory. Use of a TTIN as permitted by this section will not result in application of any penalty for failure to include a correct taxpayer identifying number on any payee statement or other document. For example, the section 6722 penalty for failure to timely furnish a correct statement would not apply solely because the payor used a TTIN as permitted by this section.

(2) *TTIN not permitted.* Use of a TTIN is not permitted in the following circumstances:

(i) A TTIN may not be used on a statement or other document if such use is prohibited by statute, regulation, other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, form, or instructions.

(ii) A TTIN may not be used on a statement or document if a statute, regulation, other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, form, or instructions, specifically requires use of a SSN, ITIN, ATIN, or EIN. For example, a TTIN may not be used on a Form W-8ECI or Form W-8IMY because the forms and/or form instructions specifically prescribe use of an SSN, EIN, or ITIN for the U.S. taxpayer identification number.

(iii) A TTIN may not be used on any return, statement, or other document that is required to be filed with or furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.

(iv) A person may not truncate its own taxpayer identifying number on any statement or other document that it furnishes to another person. For example, an employer may not truncate its EIN on a Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement, that the employer furnishes to an employee; and a person may not truncate its TIN on a Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification.

(3) *Example.* The provisions of paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following example:

Example.On April 5, year 1, Donor contributes a used car with a blue book value of $1100 to Charitable Organization. On April 20, year 1, Charitable Organization sends Donor copies B and C of the Form 1098-C as a contemporaneous written acknowledgement of the $1100 contribution as required by section 170(f)(12). In late-February, year 2, Charitable Organization prepares and files copy A of Form 1098-C with the IRS, reporting Donor's donation of a qualified vehicle in year 1. The Charitable Organization may use a TTIN in lieu of Donor's complete SSN in the Donor's Identification Number box on copies B and C of the Form 1098-C because copies B and C of the Form 1098-C are documents required by the Internal Revenue Code and regulations to be furnished to another person, there are no applicable statutes, regulations, other published guidance, forms or instructions, that prohibit the use of a TTIN on those copies, and, there are no applicable statutes, regulations, other published guidance, forms, or instructions that specifically require use of an SSN or other identifying number on those copies. A TTIN cannot be used on copy A of the Form 1098-C, however, because copy A is required to be filed with the IRS.

(c) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies on and after *July 15, 2014.*
