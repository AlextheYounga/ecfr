(i) In the case of any organization described in section 501(c)(3), the State in which the principal office of the organization is located (as shown on the last-filed return required by section 6033, or on the application for exemption if no return has been filed), and the State in which the organization was incorporated, or if a trust, in which it was created, and

(ii) In the case of a private foundation, each State which the organization was required to list as an attachment to its last-filed return pursuant to ยง 1.6033-2(a)(2)(iv).

(2) *Applications for notification by other State officers.* Other officers of States described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, and officers of States not described in such subparagraph, may request that they be notified (either generally or with respect to a particular organization or type of organization) of determinations described in paragraph (c) of this section. In such cases, these State officers must show that they are appropriate State officers within the meaning of section 6104(c)(2). The required showing may be made by presenting a letter from the Attorney General of the State setting forth (i) the functions and authority of the State officer under State law, and (ii) sufficient facts for the Internal Revenue Service to determine that such officer is an appropriate State officer within the meaning of section 6104(c)(2).

(3) *Manner of notification.* A State officer who is entitled to be notified of a determination under this paragraph will be notified by sending him a copy of the communication from the Internal Revenue Service to the organization which informs such organization of the determination.

(b) *Inspection by State officers* - (1) *In general.* After a determination described in paragraph (c) of this section has been made, appropriate State officers within the meaning of section 6104(c)(2) may inspect the material described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph. Such material may be inspected at an office of the Internal Revenue Service which will be designated upon receipt of a request for inspection; the location of such office will be determined with due consideration of the needs of the Internal Revenue Service and the needs of the State officer entitled to inspect.

(2) *State officers who may inspect material.* Any State officer entitled to be notified of a determination without application (under paragraph (a)(1) of this section) may inspect the material described in subparagraph (3) of this paragraph upon demonstrating that he is so entitled. Any State officer who has in fact been notified by the Internal Revenue Service of a determination may inspect such material without further demonstration, unless it shall be determined by the Internal Revenue Service that such officer was not entitled to be so notified. Other State officers must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that they are entitled to be notified under paragraph (a)(2) of this section before they may inspect such material.

(3) *Material which may be inspected.* (i) Except as provided in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, a State officer who is so entitled under subparagraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph will be permitted to inspect and copy all returns, filed statements, records, reports, and other information relating to a determination described in paragraph (c) of this section which is relevant to a determination under State law, and which is in the hands of the Internal Revenue Service.

(ii) The following material will not be made available for inspection by State officers under section 6104(c) and this section -

(*a*) Interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or other federal agency of federal laws (including the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and its predecessors) which would not otherwise be made available to State officers under section 6103(d),

(*b*) Reports of informers, or any other material which would disclose the identity, or threaten the safety or anonymity, of an informer,

(*c*) Returns of persons (other than those exempt from taxation) which would not be available under section 6103(d) to the State officer requesting inspection, or

(*d*) Other material the disclosure of which the Commissioner has determined would prejudice the proper administration of the internal revenue laws.

(4) *Statement by State officer.* Before any State officer will be permitted to inspect material described in this paragraph, he must submit a statement to the Internal Revenue Service that he intends to use such material solely in fulfilling his functions under State law relating to organizations of the type described in section 501(c)(3); material is made available to State officers under this section in reliance on such statements. For provisions relating to penalties for misuse of information which is made available under section 6104(c) and this section, see 18 U.S.C. 1001.

(c) *Determinations defined.* For purposes of this section, a determination means a final determination by the Internal Revenue Service that -

(1) An organization is refused recognition as an organization described in section 501(c)(3), or has been operated in such a manner that it will not, or will no longer, be recognized as meeting the requirements for exemption under that section, or

(2) A deficiency of tax exists under section 507 or chapter 41 or 42.

For purposes of this paragraph, a determination by the Internal Revenue Service is not final until all administrative review with respect to such determination has been completed. For purposes of this section, a waiver of restrictions on assessment and collection of deficiency in tax is treated as a final determination that a deficiency of tax exists when such waiver has been finally accepted by the Internal Revenue Service. For example, a final determination that a deficiency of tax exists under section 507 or chapter 41 or 42 is made when the organization is sent a notice of deficiency with respect to such tax.

(d) *Effective date.* The provisions of this section apply with respect to all determinations made after December 31, 1969.
