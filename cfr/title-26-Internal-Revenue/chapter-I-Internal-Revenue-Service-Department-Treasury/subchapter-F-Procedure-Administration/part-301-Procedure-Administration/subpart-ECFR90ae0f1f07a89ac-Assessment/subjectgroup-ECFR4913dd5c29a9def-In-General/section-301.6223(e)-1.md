##### § 301.6223(e)-1 Effect of Internal Revenue Service's failure to provide notice. #####

(a) *Notice group.* Section 6223(e)(1)(B)(ii) applies with respect to a notice group only if the request for notice described in § 301.6223(b)-1 is received by the Internal Revenue Service at least 30 days before the notice is mailed to the tax matters partner.

(b) *Indirect partners*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of section 6223(e), the Internal Revenue Service's failure to provide notice to a pass-thru partner entitled to notice under section 6223(b) is deemed a failure to provide notice to indirect partners holding an interest in the partnership through the pass-thru partner. However, this rule does not apply if the indirect partner—

(i) Receives notice from the Internal Revenue Service;

(ii) Is identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and § 301.6223(c)-1 at least 30 days before the notice is mailed to the tax matters partner; or

(iii) Is a member of a notice group entitled to notice under paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) *Examples.* The provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

Example 1.Partnership ABC has as one of its partners, A, a partnership with three partners, X, Y, and Z. ABC does not have more than 100 partners, and partnership A is entitled to notice under section 6223(a). In addition, Z was identified as provided in section 6223(c)(3) and § 301.6223(c)-1 on May 1, 2002. The Internal Revenue Service mailed a notice to the tax matters partner of ABC on July 1, 2002, but failed to provide notice to partnership A. Notwithstanding the Internal Revenue Service's notice to the tax matters partner, the Internal Revenue Service is deemed to have failed to provide notice to X and Y. The Internal Revenue Service's failure to provide notice to A, however, has no effect on Z; whether notice was provided to Z is determined independently.Example 2.Assume the same facts as in *Example 1,* except that the Internal Revenue Service provided notice to partnership A but did not provide separate notice to Z. Notwithstanding the Internal Revenue Service's notice to partnership A, the Internal Revenue Service is deemed to have failed to provide notice to Z.Example 3.Assume the same facts as in *Example 1,* except that partnership ABC has more than 100 partners and partnership A is entitled to notice under section 6223(b) because it had at least a 1 percent profits interest in partnership ABC. In addition, X became a member of a notice group on June 1, 2002, and the Internal Revenue Service mailed a notice to the designated member of that notice group. The Internal Revenue Service also mailed a separate notice to Z. The Internal Revenue Service's failure to provide notice to partnership A only affects Y, who is deemed not to have been provided notice by the Internal Revenue Service.

(c) *Effective date.* This section is applicable to partnership taxable years beginning on or after October 4, 2001. For years beginning prior to October 4, 2001, see § 301.6223(e)-1T contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised April 1, 2001.
