##### § 301.7701-2T Business entities; definitions (temporary). #####

(a) through (c)(2)(iv)(C)(*1*) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 301.7701-2(a) through (c)(2)(iv)(C)(*1*).

(*2*) Section 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) applies to taxes imposed under subtitle A, including Chapter 2 - Tax on Self-Employment Income. Thus, an entity that is treated in the same manner as a sole proprietorship under § 301.7701-2(a) is not treated as a corporation for purposes of employing its owner; instead, the entity is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for this purpose and is not the employer of its owner. The owner will be subject to self-employment tax on self-employment income with respect to the entity's activities. Also, if a partnership is the owner of an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under § 301.7701-2, the entity is not treated as a corporation for purposes of employing a partner of the partnership that owns the entity; instead, the entity is disregarded as an entity separate from the partnership for this purpose and is not the employer of any partner of the partnership that owns the entity. A partner of a partnership that owns an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under § 301.7701-2 is subject to the same self-employment tax rules as a partner of a partnership that does not own an entity that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for any purpose under § 301.7701-2.

(c)(2)(iv)(D) through (e)(7) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv)(D) through (e)(7).
