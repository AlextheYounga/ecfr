##### § 49.4263-6 Exemptions applicable with respect to transportation beginning before November 16, 1962. #####

Section 5(b) of the Tax Rate Extension Act of 1962 repealed the exemptions contained in former section 4263(b) for motor vehicles with seating capacity of less than ten and in former section 4263(c) for fishing trips by boat effective with respect to transportation beginning after November 15, 1962. With respect to transportation which began before November 16, 1962, the tax imposed by section 4261 does not apply with respect to any amount paid for transportation.

(a) By a motor vehicle having a seating capacity of less than ten adult passengers, including the driver, unless such vehicle is operated on an established line, or

(b) By boat where the transportation is for the purpose of fishing from such boat.

In the case of the exemption with respect to a motor vehicle having a seating capacity of less than ten adult passengers, the terms “operated on an established line” means operated with some degree of regularity between definite points. It does not necessarily mean that strict regularity of schedule is maintained; that the full run is always made; that a particular route is followed; or that intermediate stops are restricted. The term implies that the person rendering the service maintains and exercises control over the direction, route, time, number of passengers carried, etc.[T.D. 6618, 27 FR 11226, Nov. 14, 1962]
