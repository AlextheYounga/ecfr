##### § 49.4261-8 Examples of payments not subject to tax. #####

In addition to a payment specifically exempt under section 4263, 4292, 4293, or 4294 the following are examples of payments not subject to tax:

(a) *Exchange of prepaid order, scrip, etc., for tickets.* A ticket issued pursuant to an exchange order, prepaid order, airline pilot order, or scrip, is not subject to tax where the tax is paid at the time of payment for the order or scrip.

(b) *Caretakers and messengers accompanying freight shipments.* The tax on the transportation of persons does not apply to amounts paid for transportation of freight that includes also the transportation of caretakers or messengers for which no specific charge as such is made.

(c) *Special baggage transportation equipment.* An amount paid for special baggage transportation equipment is not subject to the tax on the transportation of persons if separable from the payment for transportation of persons and if shown in the exact amount of the charge on the records covering the taxable transportation payment.

(d) *Circus or show conveyances.* The amount paid pursuant to a contract for the movement of a circus or show conveyance where the amount covers only the transportation of the performers, laborers, animals, equipment, etc., by such conveyances is not subject to the tax on the transportation of persons imposed by section 4261. However, if the contract payment also covers the issuance to advance agents, bill posters, etc., of circus or show scrip books, or other evidence of the right to transportation, for use on regular passenger conveyances, that portion of the contract payment properly allocable to such scrip books or other evidence is subject to the tax on the transportation of persons.

(e) *Corpses.* The tax on the transportation of persons does not apply to the amount paid for the transportation of a corpse, but does apply to the amount paid for the transportation of any person accompanying the corpse.

(f) *Miscellaneous charges.* Where the charge is separable from the payment for the transportation of a person and is shown in the exact amount thereof on the records pertaining to the transportation payment, the tax on the transportation of persons does not apply to the following and similar charges:

Charges incurred by the carrier which are part of its costs of operation, such as bridge tolls, road tolls, or ferry charges, paid by the carrier on account of the bus and driver, cannot be deducted from the charge made to the passenger in determining the taxable charges for transportation.

(4) Charges for admissions, guides, meals, hotel accommodations, and other nontransportation services, for example, where such items are included in a lump sum payment for an all-expense tour.

(5) Charges in connection with the charter of a land, water, or air conveyance for the transportation of persons beginning before November 16, 1962, or an air conveyance for transportation of persons which begins after November 15, 1962, such as for parking, icing, sanitation, “layover” or “waiting time”, movement of equipment in deadhead service, dockage, or wharfage, etc.
