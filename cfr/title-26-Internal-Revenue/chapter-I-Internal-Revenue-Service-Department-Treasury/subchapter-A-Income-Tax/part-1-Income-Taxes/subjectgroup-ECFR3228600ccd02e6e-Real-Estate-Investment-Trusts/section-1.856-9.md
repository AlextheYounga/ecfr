##### ยง 1.856-9 Treatment of certain qualified REIT subsidiaries. #####

(a) *In general.* A qualified REIT subsidiary, even though it is otherwise not treated as a corporation separate from the REIT, is treated as a separate corporation for purposes of:

(1) Federal tax liabilities of the qualified REIT subsidiary with respect to any taxable period for which the qualified REIT subsidiary was treated as a separate corporation.

(2) Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the qualified REIT subsidiary is liable.

(3) Refunds or credits of Federal tax.

(b) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (a) of this section:

Example 1.X, a calendar year taxpayer, is a domestic corporation 100 percent of the stock of which is acquired by Y, a real estate investment trust, in 2002. X was not a member of a consolidated group at any time during its taxable year ending in December 2001. Consequently, X is treated as a qualified REIT subsidiary under the provisions of section 856(i) for 2002 and later periods. In 2004, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment for X's 2001 taxable year. Because X was treated as a separate corporation for its 2001 taxable year, X is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations.Example 2.The facts are the same as in *Example 1*, except that upon Y's acquisition of X, Y and X jointly elect under section 856(l) to treat X as a taxable REIT subsidiary of Y. In 2003, Y and X jointly revoke that election. Consequently, X is treated as a qualified REIT subsidiary under the provisions of section 856(i) for 2003 and later periods. In 2004, the IRS determines that X miscalculated and underreported its income tax liability for 2001. Because X was treated as a separate corporation for its 2001 taxable year, the deficiency may be assessed against X and, in the event that X fails to pay the liability after notice and demand, a general tax lien will arise against all of X's property and rights to property.Example 3.X is a qualified REIT subsidiary of Y under the provisions of section 856(i). In 2001, Z, a domestic corporation that reports its taxes on a calendar year basis, merges into X in a state law merger. Z was not a member of a consolidated group at any time during its taxable year ending in December 2000. Under the applicable state law, X is the successor to Z and is liable for all of Z's debts. In 2004, the IRS seeks to extend the period of limitations on assessment for Z's 2000 taxable year. Because X is the successor to Z and is liable for Z's 2000 taxes that remain unpaid, X is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations.

(c) *Effective date.* This section applies on or after April 1, 2004.
