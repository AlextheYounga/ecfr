##### § 1.337(d)-7T Tax on property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT. #####

(a) *General Rule* - (1) *Property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT.* If property owned by a C corporation (as defined in § 1.337(d)-7(a)(2)(i)) becomes the property of a RIC or a REIT in a conversion transaction (as defined in § 1.337(d)-7(a)(2)(ii)), then section 1374 treatment will apply as described in § 1.337(d)-7(b) and paragraph (b) of this section, unless the C corporation elects, or is treated as electing, deemed sale treatment with respect to the conversion transaction as provided in § 1.337(d)-7(c) and paragraph (c) of this section. See § 1.337(d)-7(d) for exceptions to this paragraph (a).

(2)(i) through (v) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.337(d)-7(a)(2)(i) through (v).

(vi) *Section 355 distribution.* The term *section 355 distribution* means any distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates to section 355) applies, including a distribution on which the distributing corporation recognizes gain pursuant to sections 355(d) or 355(e).

(vii) *Converted property.* The term *converted property* means property owned by a C corporation that becomes the property of a RIC or a REIT.

(b)(1) through (3) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.337(d)-7(b)(1) through (3).

(4) *Section 355 distribution following a conversion transaction* - (i) *In general.* If a REIT is described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and the related section 355 distribution (as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section) follows a conversion transaction, then for the taxable year in which the related section 355 distribution occurs, § 1.1374-2(a)(1) and (2) (as modified by § 1.337(d)-7(b)(2)(i)) do not apply, and the REIT's net recognized built-in gain for such taxable year is the amount of its net unrealized built-in gain limitation (as defined in § 1.1374-2(a)(3)) for such taxable year.

(ii) *Basis adjustment* - (A) *In general.* If a REIT recognizes gain under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the aggregate basis of the converted property held by the REIT at the end of the taxable year in which the related section 355 distribution occurs shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount of gain so recognized, increased by the amount of the REIT's recognized built-in loss for such taxable year, and reduced by the amount of the REIT's recognized built-in gain and recognized built-in gain carryover for such taxable year.

(B) *Allocation of basis increase.* The aggregate increase in basis by reason of paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(A) of this section shall be allocated among the converted property in proportion to their respective built-in gains on the date of the conversion transaction.

(5) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.337(d)-7(b)(5).

(c) *Election of deemed sale treatment* - (1) *In general.* Section 1.337(d)-7(b) and paragraph (b) of this section do not apply if the C corporation that qualifies as a RIC or a REIT or transfers property to a RIC or a REIT makes the election described in § 1.337(d)-7(c)(5) or is treated as making such election under paragraph (c)(6) of this section. A C corporation that makes, or is treated as making, such an election recognizes gain and loss as if it sold the converted property to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date (as defined in § 1.337(d)-7(c)(3)). See § 1.337(d)-7(c)(4) concerning limitations on the use of loss in computing gain. Section 1.337(d)-7(c) and this paragraph (c) do not apply if their application would result in the recognition of a net loss. For this purpose, net loss is the excess of aggregate losses over aggregate gains (including items of income), without regard to character.

(2) through (5) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.337(d)-7(c)(2) through (5).

(6) *Conversion transaction following a section 355 distribution.* A C corporation described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section is treated as having made the election under § 1.337(d)-7(c)(5) with respect to a conversion transaction if the conversion transaction occurs following the related section 355 distribution (as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section) and the C corporation has not made such election.

(7) through (e) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.337(d)-7(c)(7) through (e).

Predecessors and successors include corporations which succeed to and take into account items described in section 381(c) of the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation, and corporations having such items to which the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation succeeded and took into account.

(3) *Exclusion of certain conversion transactions.* A C corporation or a REIT is not described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section if -

(i) The distributing corporation and the controlled corporation are both REITs immediately after the related section 355 distribution (including by reason of elections under section 856(c)(1) made after the related section 355 distribution that are effective before the related section 355 distribution) and at all times during the two years thereafter;
