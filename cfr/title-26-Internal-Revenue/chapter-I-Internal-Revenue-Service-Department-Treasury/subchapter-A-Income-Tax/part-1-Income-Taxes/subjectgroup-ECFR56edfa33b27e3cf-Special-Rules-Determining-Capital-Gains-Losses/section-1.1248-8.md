See § 1.1248(f)-2(e), *Example 2* and *Example 3.*

(3) *Earnings and profits attributable to stock in a foreign corporation certain acquiring corporations receive in a restructuring transaction.* Where an acquiring corporation receives, in a restructuring transaction, stock in a foreign acquired corporation, the holding period of which is determined under section 1223(2), and the acquiring corporation is either a section 1248 shareholder or a foreign corporate shareholder with respect to that foreign acquired corporation immediately after the restructuring transaction, the earnings and profits attributable to the foreign acquired corporation stock that the acquiring corporation receives shall be determined pursuant to the rules in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(i) *Stock of a foreign corporation with respect to which the exchanging shareholder is neither a section 1248 shareholder nor a foreign corporate shareholder.* The earnings and profits attributable to the stock of the foreign acquired corporation that the acquiring corporation receives in a restructuring transaction where the exchanging shareholder is neither a section 1248 shareholder nor a foreign corporate shareholder with respect to that foreign acquired corporation immediately before the restructuring transaction shall be determined in accordance with § 1.1248-2 or § 1.1248-3, whichever is applicable, without regard to any portion of the section 1223(2) holding period in that stock that is prior to the restructuring transaction.

See paragraph (b)(7) *Example 3, Example 5,* and *Example 7* of this section.

(4) *Earnings and profits attributable to stock held by a non-exchanging shareholder in a foreign acquiring corporation.* (i) Except to the extent paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section applies, the earnings and profits attributable to stock of a foreign acquiring corporation held by a non-exchanging shareholder immediately prior to a restructuring transaction continue to be attributed to such stock, and the earnings and profits of the acquired corporation accumulated prior to the restructuring transaction attributable to the stock of an acquired corporation are not attributed to the non-exchanging shareholder's stock in the foreign acquiring corporation. See § 1.1248-2 or § 1.1248-3 (whichever is applicable) and, as applicable, paragraph (b)(6) of this section; see also paragraph (b)(7) *Example 2* and *Example 4* of this section.

See paragraph (b)(7) *Example 6* of this section.

(5) *Reduction in earnings and profits attributable to stock to prevent multiple inclusions with respect to the same earnings and profits.* To the extent consistent with the principles of section 1248, adjustments to earnings and profits attributable to stock shall be made such that section 1223(1) and (2) and this section are applied in a manner that results in earnings and profits being taken into account only once. Thus, for example, when a controlled foreign corporation sells or exchanges all or part of the stock of another foreign corporation to which earnings and profits are attributable pursuant to this paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of this section, proportionate reductions shall be made to the earnings and profits attributed to the stock of the selling foreign corporate shareholder owned by a section 1248 shareholder. See paragraph (b)(7) *Example 7* of this section.

(6) *Special rule regarding section 381.* Solely for purposes of determining the earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) attributable to stock pursuant to this paragraph (b), the earnings and profits of a corporation shall not include earnings and profits that are treated as received or incurred under section 381(c)(2)(A) and § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a). See paragraph (b)(7) *Example 4* of this section.

(7) *Examples.* The application of this paragraph (b) is illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise indicated, in the following examples assume that—

(i) There is no immediate gain recognition pursuant to section 367(a)(1) and the regulations under that section (either through operation of the rules or because the appropriate parties have entered into a gain recognition agreement under §§ 1.367(a)-3(b) and 1.367(a)-8);

(ii) There is no income inclusion required pursuant to section 367(b) and the regulations under that section, and all reporting requirements in those regulations are complied with;

(iii) References to earnings and profits are to earnings and profits that would be includible in income as a dividend under section 1248 and the regulations under that section if stock to which the earnings and profits are attributable were sold or exchanged by its shareholder;

(iv) Each corporation has only a single class of stock outstanding and uses the calendar year as its taxable year; and

(v) Each transaction is unrelated to all other transactions.

Example 1. A section 351 exchange of property other than stock in a foreign corporation with respect to which the exchanging shareholder is either a section 1248 shareholder or a foreign corporate shareholder.(i) *Facts.* DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC, a foreign corporation, since CFC's formation on January 1, year 3. On December 31, year 5, DC2, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, contributes property it has held since January 1, year 1, to CFC in exchange for voting stock of CFC in a restructuring transaction that is an exchange under section 351. The property that DC2 contributes is not stock in a foreign corporation with respect to which DC2 was either a section 1248 shareholder or a foreign corporate shareholder. DC2 receives 80% of the voting stock of CFC in the restructuring transaction and its holding period in that CFC stock, determined pursuant to section 1223(1), began on January 1, year 1. CFC has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits on December 31, year 5. On December 31, year 7, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are $200, DC2, a section 1248 shareholder with respect to CFC, sells its CFC stock.

(ii) *Result.* Under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC2 are $80. This amount consists of none of the $100 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC before the restructuring transaction, and 80% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.

Example 2. A section 351 exchange of controlled foreign corporation stock by a United States person for stock in a controlled foreign corporation in a restructuring transaction.(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in *Example 1* except as follows. The property that DC2 contributes is 100% of the stock in CFC2, a foreign corporation. DC2 has owned all the stock of CFC2 since CFC2's formation on January 1, year 2, and CFC2 has $200 of earnings and profits as of December 31, year 5. CFC2 does not accumulate any additional earnings and profits from December 31, year 5, to December 31, year 7. On December 31, year 7, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are $200, DC2, a section 1248 shareholder with respect to CFC, sells its CFC stock. Also on that date, DC1 sells its CFC stock.

(ii) *Result.* (A) *DC2 sale.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC2 are $280. This amount consists of all of the $200 of earnings and profits of CFC2 accumulated before the restructuring transaction (see also section 1248(c)(2)), none of the $100 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC before the restructuring transaction, and 80% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.

(B) *DC1 sale.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC stock sold by DC1, a non-exchanging shareholder in the restructuring transaction, are $120. This amount consists of all of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated before the restructuring transaction, none of the $200 of earnings and profits of CFC2 accumulated before the restructuring transaction, and 20% of the $100 of earnings and profits of CFC accumulated after the restructuring transaction.

Example 3. A section 351 exchange of controlled foreign corporation stock by a United States person for stock in a domestic corporation in a restructuring transaction.(i) *Facts.* DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all of the stock of CFC, a foreign corporation, since CFC's formation on January 1, year 1. DC1 has also owned all the stock of DC2, a domestic corporation, since DC2's formation on January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 2, DC1 contributes the stock of CFC to DC2 in exchange for stock in DC2 in a restructuring transaction that is an exchange described in section 351. On December 31, year 2, CFC has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits. DC2 has a basis in the CFC stock determined under section 362, and is considered to have held the CFC stock since January 1, year 1, pursuant to section 1223(2). On December 31, year 4, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC are still $100, DC2 sells its CFC stock.

(ii) *Result.* Under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, $100 of accumulated earnings and profits of CFC is attributable to the stock of CFC sold by DC2, even though DC2 did not hold the stock of CFC during the time CFC accumulated the earnings and profits.

Example 4. Acquisition of a controlled foreign corporation by a controlled foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C) (or section 368(a)(1)(B)).(i) *Facts.* DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. DC2, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, has owned all of the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets to CFC2 in exchange for 25% of the voting stock of CFC2. CFC1 distributes the CFC2 stock to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. DC1's holding period in the CFC2 stock, determined under section 1223(1), begins on January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of accumulated earnings and profits and CFC2 has $200 of accumulated earnings and profits. CFC2 succeeds to the $100 of CFC1 accumulated earnings and profits in the reorganization under section 381. From January 1, year 4 to December 31, year 5, CFC2 incurred a deficit in earnings and profits in the amount of ($200). On December 31, year 5, both DC1 and DC2 sell their stock in CFC2.

(ii) *Result.* (A) *DC1.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, $50 of earnings and profits is attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1. This amount consists of $100 of CFC1's earnings and profits accumulated before the restructuring transaction, reduced by 25% of CFC2's ($200) post-restructuring transaction deficit in earnings and profits. None of the $200 of CFC2's earnings and profits accumulated by CFC2 prior to the reorganization is attributed to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1. Also, none of the earnings and profits CFC2 succeeded to under section 381 is attributed to the CFC2 stock sold by DC1, pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

(B) *DC2.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, there is $50 of accumulated earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC2. This amount consists of all of the $200 of CFC2's earnings and profits accumulated by CFC2 prior to the reorganization, reduced by 75% of CFC2's deficit in earnings and profits in the amount of ($200) incurred after the restructuring transaction. None of the $100 of CFC1 accumulated earnings and profits succeeded to under section 381 is attributable to the CFC2 stock sold by DC2, pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section.

(C) *Section 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization.* If, instead of DC1 acquiring its 25% interest in CFC2 pursuant to a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), DC1 had transferred the stock of CFC1 to CFC2 in exchange for 25% of the voting stock of CFC2 in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), the results would be the same as described in paragraphs (ii) (A) and (B) of this *Example 4.*

Example 5. Acquisition of the stock of a foreign corporation that controls a domestic acquiring corporation in a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C).(i) *Facts.* DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 has owned all the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. FC, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation, has owned all of the stock of DC2, a domestic corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that was a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets, including the CFC2 stock, to DC2 in exchange for 60% of the voting stock of FC. CFC1 transfers the voting stock of FC to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. Pursuant to section 1223(1), DC1 is considered to have held the stock of FC since January 1, year 1. Under section 1223(2), DC2 is considered to have held the stock of CFC2 since January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of earnings and profits, CFC2 has $300 of earnings and profits, and FC has $200 of earnings and profits. DC1 includes the $100 all earnings and profits amount attributable to its CFC1 stock in income as a deemed dividend under § 1.367(b)-3 upon the exchange of CFC1 stock for FC stock. Pursuant to the lower-tier earnings exclusion of § 1.367(b)-2(d)(3)(ii), that amount does not include the $300 of earnings and profits of CFC2. From January 1, year 4, until December 31, year 5, FC (now a controlled foreign corporation) accumulates an additional $50 of earnings and profits. From January 1, year 4 until December 31, year 5, CFC2 accumulates an additional $100 of earnings and profits. On December 31, year 5, DC1 sells its stock in FC and DC2 sells its stock in CFC2.

(ii) *Result.* (A) *DC1.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, there is $30 of earnings and profits attributable to the stock of FC sold by DC1. This amount consists of 60% of the $50 of earnings and profits accumulated by FC after the restructuring transaction, and none of the earnings and profits accumulated by CFC1, CFC2, or FC before the restructuring transaction.

(B) *DC2.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, there is $400 of earnings and profits attributable to the stock of CFC2 sold by DC2. This amount consists of all of the earnings and profits accumulated by CFC2 during DC2's section 1223(2) holding period.

Example 6. Acquisition of the stock of a foreign corporation that controls a foreign acquiring corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C).(i) *Facts.* DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 has owned all the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. FC, a foreign corporation that is not a controlled foreign corporation, has owned all of the stock of FC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that was a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC1 transfers all of its assets, including the CFC2 stock, to FC2 in exchange for 60% of the voting stock of FC. CFC1 transfers the voting stock of FC to DC1 and the CFC1 stock is cancelled. Pursuant to section 1223(1), DC1 is considered to have held the stock of FC since January 1, year 1. Under section 1223(2), FC2 is considered to have held the stock of CFC2 since January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 3, CFC1 has $100 of earnings and profits, CFC2 has $300 of earnings and profits, FC has $200 of earnings and profits, and FC2 has no earnings and profits. From January 1, year 4, until December 31, year 5, FC (now a controlled foreign corporation) accumulates an additional $50 of earnings and profits. From January 1, year 4 until December 31, year 5, CFC2 accumulates an additional $100 of earnings and profits. FC2, a controlled foreign corporation after the restructuring transaction, accumulates $100 of earnings and profits from January 1, year 4, until December 31, year 5. On December 31, year 5, DC1 sells its stock in FC.

(ii) *Result.* Pursuant to paragraphs (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of this section, there is $550 of earnings and profits attributable to the stock of FC sold by DC1. This amount consists of all $400 of the CFC1 and CFC2 earnings and profits accumulated before the restructuring transaction (see also section 1248(c)(2)), and 60% of the $250 of the earnings and profits accumulated by FC, FC2, and CFC2 after the restructuring transaction.

Example 7. Acquisition of controlled foreign corporation stock by a controlled foreign corporation in a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), followed by a sale of the acquired stock by the acquiring controlled foreign corporation.(i) *Facts.* DC1, a domestic corporation, has owned all of the outstanding stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 has owned all of the outstanding stock of CFC3, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. DC2, a domestic corporation unrelated to DC1, has owned all of the outstanding stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 2. On December 31, year 3, pursuant to a restructuring transaction that is a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(B), CFC1 transfers all of the stock of CFC3 to CFC2 in exchange for 40% of CFC2's stock. On December 31, year 3, CFC2 and CFC3 have, respectively, $40 and $20 of earnings and profits. On December 31, year 5, when the accumulated earnings and profits of CFC3 are $50 ($20 of earnings and profits as of December 31, year 3, plus $30 of earnings and profits generated from January 1, year 4, through December 31, year 5), CFC2 sells the stock of CFC3 in a transaction to which section 964(e) applies.

(ii) *Result.* (A) *CFC2.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, there is $50 of earnings and profits attributable to the CFC3 stock sold by CFC2. This amount consists of the accumulated earnings and profits attributable to CFC2's entire section 1223(2) holding period in the CFC3 stock.

(B) *CFC1, DC2, and DC1.* Under paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock held by CFC1 and DC2, and the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock held by DC1, will be reduced (regardless of whether CFC2 recognizes gain on its sale of CFC3 stock).

(*1*) *CFC1.* The earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock held by CFC1 will be reduced by $32, or the amount of earnings and profits as of December 31, year 5, that would have been attributable to the CFC2 stock held by CFC1 pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. This amount consists of all of the $20 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC3 before the restructuring transaction and 40% of the $30 of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC3 after the restructuring transaction (.40 × $30 = $12).

(*2*) *DC1.* The earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock held by DC1 will also be reduced by $32, or the amount of earnings and profits that would have been attributable to the CFC1 stock held by DC1 as of December 31, year 5.

(*3*) *DC2.* The earnings and profits attributable to the CFC2 stock held by DC2 will be reduced by $18, or the amount of earnings and profits that would have been attributable to the CFC2 stock held by DC2 as of December 31, year 5, under paragraph (b)(4) of this section. This amount consists of 60% of the $30 (.60 × $30 = $18) of earnings and profits accumulated by CFC3 after the restructuring transaction.

(C) *Partial sale by CFC2.* If, instead of selling 100% of the CFC3 stock, on December 31, year 5, CFC2 sells only 50% of its CFC3 stock, paragraph (b)(5) of this section requires CFC1 to reduce the earnings and profits of CFC3 attributable to its CFC2 stock to $16. Similarly, DC1 would be required to reduce the earnings and profits of CFC3 attributable to its CFC1 stock by $16. Paragraph (b)(5) of this section also requires DC2 to reduce the CFC3 earnings and profits attributable to its CFC2 stock by $9. These reductions occur without regard to whether CFC2 recognizes gain on its sale of CFC3 stock.

Example 8. Acquisition of the assets of a lower-tier controlled foreign corporation by an upper-tier controlled foreign corporation in a restructuring transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(C).(i) *Facts.* DC, a domestic corporation, has owned all the stock of CFC1, a controlled foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 is a holding company that has owned 79% of the stock of CFC2, a controlled foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. The other 21% of CFC2 stock is owned by X, an unrelated party. On December 31, year 1, CFC2 has $200 of earnings and profits. On December 31, year 1, CFC1 has no accumulated earnings and profits. On December 31, year 1, pursuant to a restructuring transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(C), CFC2 transfers all its properties to CFC1. In exchange, CFC1 assumes the liabilities of CFC2 and transfers to CFC2 voting stock representing 21% of the stock of CFC1. CFC2 distributes the voting stock to X and liquidates. The liabilities assumed do not exceed 20% of the value of the properties of CFC2. From January 1, year 2, to December 31, year 3, CFC1 accumulates $100 of earnings and profits. On December 31, year 3, DC sells its CFC1 stock.

(ii) *Result.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, there is $237 of earnings and profits attributable to DC's CFC1 stock. This amount consists of 79% of CFC2's $200 of earnings and profits accumulated before the restructuring transaction (see section 1248(c)(2)), and 79% of CFC1's $100 of earnings and profits accumulated after the restructuring transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(6) of this section, none of CFC2's $200 of earnings and profits to which CFC1 succeeded under section 381 would be attributable to DC's CFC1 stock.

(c) *Earnings and profits attributable to stock of a foreign distributee corporation that is a foreign corporate shareholder with respect to a foreign liquidating corporation*—(1) *General rule.* If a foreign corporation (liquidating corporation) makes a distribution of property in complete liquidation under section 332 to a foreign corporation (distributee), and immediately before the liquidation the distributee was a foreign corporate shareholder with respect to the liquidating foreign corporation, the amount of earnings and profits attributable to the distributee stock upon its subsequent sale or exchange will be determined under this paragraph (c)(1). The earnings and profits attributable will be the sum of the earnings and profits attributable to the stock of the distributee immediately before the liquidation (including amounts attributed under section 1248(c)(2)) and the earnings and profits attributable to the stock of the distributee accumulated after the liquidation (including amounts attributed under section 1248(c)(2)).

(2) *Special rule regarding section 381.* Solely for purposes of determining the earnings and profits (or deficit in earnings and profits) attributable to stock under this paragraph (c), the attributed earnings and profits of a corporation shall not include earnings and profits that are treated as received or incurred pursuant to section 381(c)(2)(A) and § 1.381(c)(2)-1(a).

(3) *Example—* (i) *Facts.* DC, a domestic corporation, has owned all of the stock of CFC1, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. CFC1 is an operating company that has owned all of the stock of CFC2, a foreign corporation, since its formation on January 1, year 1. On December 31, year 2, CFC1 has $200 of accumulated earnings and profits and CFC2 has a ($200) deficit in earnings and profits. On December 31, year 2, CFC2 distributes all of its assets and liabilities to CFC1 in a liquidation to which section 332 applies. From January 1, year 3, until December 31, year 4, CFC1 accumulates no additional earnings and profits. On December 31, year 4, DC sells its stock in CFC1.

(ii) *Result.* Pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, there are no earnings and profits attributable to DC's CFC1 stock. This amount consists of the sum of the earnings and profits attributable to the CFC1 stock immediately before the liquidation (100% of the $200 accumulated earnings and profits of CFC1 and 100% of CFC2's ($200) deficit in earnings and profits) and the amount of earnings and profits accumulated after the section 332 liquidation (see also section 1248(c)(2)).

(d) *Effective/applicability dates*—(1) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, this section applies to income inclusions that occur on or after July 30, 2007.

(2) *Exception.* Paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section applies to restructuring transactions occurring on or after April 18, 2013.
