(a) *In general.* Taxable income of a foreign investment company means taxable income as defined in section 63(a), computed without regard to subchapter N, chapter 1 of the Code, and in accordance with the following rules:

(1) There shall be excluded the excess, if any, of the company's net long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss. See ยง 1.1247-3 for the manner of computing such excess.

(2) The deduction provided in section 172 (relating to net operating losses) shall not be allowed.

(3) Except for the deduction provided in section 248 (relating to organizational expenditures), the special deductions provided for corporations in part VIII (sections 241 and following), subchapter B, chapter 1 of the Code shall not be allowed.

(4) In computing the amount of the deduction allowed under section 164 there shall be included taxes paid or accrued during the taxable year which are imposed by the United States or by the country under the laws of which the company is created or organized. See, however, ยง 1.1247-4.

(b) *Election to distribute taxable income after close of taxable year.* A company may elect under section 1247(a)(2)(B), in respect of taxable income for a taxable year, to treat a distribution made not later than 2 months and 15 days after the close of such taxable year as a distribution made during such taxable year of such taxable income. The company shall make the election by attaching to the information return required by paragraph (c)(1) of ยง 1.1247-5 for such taxable year a statement setting forth the amount of each distribution (or portion thereof) to which the election applies and the date of each such distribution. The election shall be irrevocable after the expiration of the time for filing such information return. The distribution (or portion thereof) to which the election applies shall be considered as paid out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year for which such election is made, and not out of the earnings and profits of the taxable year in which the distribution is actually made. A distribution to which this paragraph applies shall be includible in the gross income of a shareholder of the foreign investment company for his taxable year in which received or accrued.
