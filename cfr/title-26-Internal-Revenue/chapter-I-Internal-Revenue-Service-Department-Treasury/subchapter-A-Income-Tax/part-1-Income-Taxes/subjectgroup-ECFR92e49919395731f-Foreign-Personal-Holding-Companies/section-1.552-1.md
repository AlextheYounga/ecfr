##### ยง 1.552-1 Definition of foreign personal holding company. #####

(a) A foreign personal holding company is any foreign corporation, other than a corporation exempt from taxation under subchapter F (section 501 and following), chapter 1 of the Code, and other than certain banking institutions which satisfy the requirements of section 552(b)(2) and paragraph (b) of ยง 1.552-4 which for the taxable year meets (1) the gross income requirement specified in section 552(a)(1); and (2) the stock ownership requirement specified in section 552(a)(2). Both requirements must be satisfied with respect to each taxable year.

(b) A foreign corporation which comes within the classification of a foreign personal holding company is not subject to taxation either under section 531 or section 541. See sections 532(b)(2) and 542(c)(5). The fact that a foreign corporation is a foreign personal holding company does not relieve the corporation from liability for the taxes imposed generally upon foreign corporations, such as the taxes imposed by sections 881 and 882, since such taxes apply regardless of the classification of the foreign corporation as a foreign personal holding company.
