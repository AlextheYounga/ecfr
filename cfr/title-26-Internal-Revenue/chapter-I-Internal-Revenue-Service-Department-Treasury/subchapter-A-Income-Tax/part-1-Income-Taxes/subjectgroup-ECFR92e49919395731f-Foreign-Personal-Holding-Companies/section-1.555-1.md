##### ยง 1.555-1 General rule. #####

The gross income of a foreign corporation which is a foreign personal holding company is computed the same as if the foreign corporation were a domestic corporation which is a personal holding company. See section 542(a)(1) and ยง 1.542-2. The gross income of a foreign personal holding company thus includes income from all sources, whether within or without the United States, which is not specifically excluded from gross income under any other provisions of the Code. For example, the gross income of a foreign personal holding company includes all income from sources outside the United States even though the foreign personal holding company is a foreign corporation not engaged in trade or business within the United States. However, the gross income of a foreign corporation which is a foreign personal holding company shall not include, with respect to a United States shareholder described in section 951(b), dividends received by such corporation which are excluded under section 959(b) from the income of such corporation with respect to such shareholder.
