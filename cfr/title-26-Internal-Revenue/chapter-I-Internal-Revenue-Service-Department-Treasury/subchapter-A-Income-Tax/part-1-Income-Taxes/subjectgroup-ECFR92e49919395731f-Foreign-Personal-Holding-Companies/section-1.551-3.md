##### ยง 1.551-3 Deduction for obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities. #####

(a) Each United States shareholder required to return his distributive share of undistributed foreign personal holding company income for any taxable year shall take into account in computing the credit against tax under section 35, or the deduction under section 242, whichever is allowable to such shareholder, his proportionate share of whatever interest on obligations of the United States or its instrumentalities (as specified in sections 35 or 242, as the case may be) may be included in the gross income of the company for such taxable year, with the exception of any such interest as may be so included by reason of the application of the provisions of section 555. For reduction of credit for such interest on account of amortizable bond premium, see section 171 and the regulations thereunder.

(b) The rule set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.The M Corporation is a foreign personal holding company which owns all the stock of the N Corporation, another foreign personal holding company. Both companies receive interest on obligations of the United States or its instrumentalities as specified in section 35. In determining the amount of the credit allowable under section 35 (if the shareholder is an individual) or the deduction allowable under section 242 (if the shareholder is a corporation), the United States shareholder of the M Corporation would be entitled to a credit or a deduction, as the case may be, only for his proportionate share of the interest received by that Company and not for any part of the interest received by the N Corporation, regardless of whether the interest received by the N Corporation is included in the gross income of the M Corporation as an actual dividend or as a constructive dividend under section 555.
