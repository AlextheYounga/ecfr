##### ยง 1.564-1 Dividend carryover. #####

(a) *General rule.* The dividend carryover from the two preceding years, allowable only to personal holding companies, is includible in the dividends paid deduction under section 561. It is computed as follows:

(1) If, for each of the preceding two years, the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 (determined without regard to the dividend carryover to each such year) exceeds the taxable income (adjusted as provided in section 545 for purposes of determining undistributed personal holding company income) then the dividend carryover to the taxable year is the sum of both such excess amounts.

(2) If the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 for the second preceding year (determined without regard to the dividend carryover to such year) exceeds the taxable income for such year (adjusted as provided in section 545), and if the taxable income for the first preceding year (as so adjusted) exceeds the dividends paid deduction for such first preceding year (as so determined), then the dividend carryover to the taxable year shall be such excess amount for the second preceding year, less such excess amount for the first preceding year.

(3) If for the first preceding year the deduction for dividends paid under section 561 (determined without regard to the dividend carryover to such year) exceeds the taxable income (adjusted as provided in section 545) for such year, and such excess is not present in the second preceding year, then the dividend carryover to the taxable year shall be such excess amount for the first preceding year.

(b) *Dividend carryover from year in which taxpayer was not a personal holding company.* In computing the dividend carryover, the taxable income as adjusted under section 545 of any preceding taxable year shall be determined as if the corporation was, under the law applicable to such taxable year, a personal holding company.

(c) *Dividend carryover from year in which taxpayer was subject to 1939 Code.* In a case where the first or the second preceding taxable year began before the taxpayer's first taxable year under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the amount of the dividend carryover shall be determined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.

(d) *Statement to be filed with return.* Every corporation claiming a dividend carryover for any taxable year shall file with its return for such year a concise statement setting forth the amount of the dividend carryover claimed and all material and pertinent facts relative thereto, including a detailed schedule showing the computation of the dividend carryover claimed.

(e) *Computation of dividend carryover.* The computation of the dividend carryover may be illustrated by the following examples:

Example 1.The X Corporation, which files its income tax returns on the calendar year basis, has taxable income, adjusted as required by section 545, in the amount of $110,000 and has a dividends paid deduction of $150,000 for the year 1954. For 1955, its taxable income, adjusted as required by section 545, is $200,000 and its dividends paid deduction is $300,000. The dividend carryover to the year 1956 is $140,000, computed as follows:
