(a) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.871-15(a).

(1) *Broker.* A *broker* is a broker within the meaning provided in section 6045(c), except that the term does not include any corporation that is a broker solely because it regularly redeems its own shares.

(a)(2) through (g)(4)(ii)(A) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.871-15(a)(2) through (g)(4)(ii)(A).

(B) A foreign securities exchange that:

(*1*) Is regulated or supervised by a governmental authority of the country in which the market is located;

(*2*) Has trading volume, listing, financial disclosure, surveillance, and other requirements designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open, fair and orderly market, and to protect investors, and the laws of the country in which the exchange is located and the rules of the exchange ensure that those requirements are actually enforced;

(*3*) Has rules that effectively promote active trading of listed options on the exchange; and

(*4*) Has an average daily trading volume on the exchange exceeding $10 billion during the immediately preceding calendar year. If an exchange in a foreign country has more than one tier or market level on which listed options may be separately listed or traded, each tier or market level is treated as a separate exchange.

(g)(5) through (p)(1)(i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.871-15(g)(5) through (p)(1)(i).

(ii) *Transactions with multiple brokers.* For a potential section 871(m) transaction in which both the short party and an agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the short party are a broker or dealer, the short party must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction. For a potential section 871(m) transaction in which the short party is not a broker or dealer and more than one agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the short party is a broker or dealer, the broker or dealer that is a party to the transaction and closest to the short party in the payment chain must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction. For a potential section 871(m) transaction in which neither the short party nor any agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the short party is a broker or dealer, and the long party and an agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the long party are a broker or dealer, or more than one agent or intermediary acting on behalf of the long party is a broker or dealer, the broker or dealer that is a party to the transaction and closest to the long party in the payment chain must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction.

(iii) *Responsible party for transactions traded on an exchange and cleared by a clearing organization.* Except as provided in paragraph (p)(1)(iv) of this section, for a potential section 871(m) transaction that is traded on an exchange and cleared by a clearing organization, and for which more than one broker-dealer acts as an agent or intermediary between the short party and a foreign payee, the broker or dealer that has an ongoing customer relationship with the foreign payee with respect to that transaction (generally the clearing firm) must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction.

(iv) *Responsible party for certain structured notes, warrants, and convertible instruments.* When a potential section 871(m) transaction is a structured note, warrant, convertible stock, or convertible debt, the issuer is the party responsible for determining whether a potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction.

(p)(1)(v) through (p)(4) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.871-15(p)(1)(v) through (p)(4).

(5) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (p) of this section:

Example.CO is a domestic clearing organization and is not a broker as defined in § 1.871-15(a)(1). CO serves as a central counterparty clearing and settlement service provider for derivatives exchanges in the United States. EB and CB are brokers organized in the United States and members of CO. FC, a foreign corporation, instructs EB to execute the purchase of a call option that is a specified ELI (as described in § 1.871-15(e)). EB effects the trade for FC on the exchange and then, as instructed by FC, transfers the option to CB to be cleared with CO. The exchange matches FC's order with an order for a written call option with the same terms and then sends the matched trade to CO, which clears the trade. CB and the clearing member representing the person who sold the call option settle the trade with CO. Upon receiving the matched trade, the option contracts are novated and CO becomes the counterparty to CB and the counterparty to the clearing member representing the person who sold the call option. Both EB and CB are broker-dealers acting on behalf of FC for a potential section 871(m) transaction. Under paragraph (p)(1)(iii) of this section, however, only CB is required to make the determinations described in § 1.871-15(p).

(q) through (r)(3) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.871-15(q) through (r)(3).

(4) Effective/applicability date. This section applies to payments made on or after January 19, 2017.

(s) *Expiration date.* This section expires January 17, 2020.
