##### § 1.871-15 Treatment of dividend equivalents. #####

(a) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings described in this paragraph (a).

(1) *Broker.* A *broker* is a broker within the meaning provided in section 6045(c).

(2) *Dealer.* A *dealer* is a dealer in securities within the meaning of section 475(c)(1).

(3) *Dividend.* A *dividend* is a dividend as described in section 316.

(4) *Equity-linked instrument.* An *equity-linked instrument* (*ELI*) is a financial transaction, other than a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction or an NPC, that references the value of one or more underlying securities. For example, a futures contract, forward contract, option, debt instrument, or other contractual arrangement that references the value of one or more underlying securities is an ELI.

(5) *Initial hedge.* An *initial hedge* is the number of underlying security shares that a short party would need to fully hedge an NPC or ELI (whether the NPC or ELI is a complex contract or a simple contract benchmark (within the meaning of paragraph (h)(2) of this section), as appropriate) with respect to an underlying security at the time the NPC or ELI is issued, even if the short party does not in fact fully hedge the NPC or ELI.

(6) *Issue.* An NPC or ELI is treated as issued at inception, original issuance, or at the time of an issuance as a result of a deemed exchange pursuant to section 1001.

(7) *Notional principal contract.* A *notional principal contract* (*NPC*) is a notional principal contract as defined in § 1.446-3(c).

(8) *Option.* An *option* includes an option embedded in any debt instrument, forward contract, NPC, or other potential section 871(m) transaction.

(9) *Parties to the transaction* - (i) *Long party.* A *long party* is the party to a potential section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security that would be entitled to receive a payment of a dividend equivalent (within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section) described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(ii) *Short party.* A *short party* is the party to a potential section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security that would be obligated to make a payment of a dividend equivalent (within the meaning of paragraph (i) of this section) described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(iii) *Party to the transaction.* A *party to the transaction* is any person that is a long party or a short party to a potential section 871(m) transaction, any agent acting on behalf of the long party or short party, or any person acting as an intermediary with respect to the potential section 871(m) transaction.

(iv) *Party to the transaction that is both a long party and a short party* - (A) *In general.* If a potential section 871(m) transaction references more than one underlying security, the long party and short party are determined separately with respect to each underlying security. A party to a potential section 871(m) transaction is both a long party and a short party when the party is entitled to a payment that references a dividend payment on an underlying security and the same party is obligated to make a payment that references a dividend payment on another underlying security pursuant to the potential section 871(m) transaction.

(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates the definitions in paragraph (a)(9) of this section:

Example.(i) Stock X and Stock Y are underlying securities. A and B enter into an NPC that entitles A to receive payments from B based on any appreciation in the value of Stock X and dividends paid on Stock X during the term of the contract and obligates A to make payments to B based on any depreciation in the value of Stock X during the term of the contract. In return, the NPC entitles B to receive payments from A based on any appreciation in the value of Stock Y and dividends paid on Stock Y during the term of the contract and obligates B to make payments to A based on any depreciation in the value of Stock Y during the term of the contract.

(ii) A is the long party with respect to Stock X, and the short party with respect to Stock Y. B is the long party with respect to Stock Y, and the short party with respect to Stock X.

(10) *Payment.* A *payment* has the meaning provided in paragraph (i) of this section.

(11) *Reference.* To *reference* means to be contingent upon or determined by reference to, directly or indirectly, whether in whole or in part.

(12) *Section 871(m) transaction and potential section 871(m) transaction.* A *section 871(m) transaction* is any securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction, specified NPC, or specified ELI. A *potential section 871(m) transaction* is any securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction, NPC, or ELI that references one or more underlying securities.

(13) *Securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction.* A *securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction* is any securities lending transaction, sale-repurchase transaction, or substantially similar transaction that references an underlying security. *Securities lending transaction* and *sale-repurchase transaction* have the same meaning as provided in § 1.861-3(a)(6).

(14) *Simple contracts and complex contracts* - (i) *Simple contract.* A *simple contract* is an NPC or ELI for which, with respect to each underlying security,

(A) All amounts to be paid or received on maturity, exercise, or any other payment determination date are calculated by reference to a single, fixed number of shares (as determined in paragraph (j)(3) of this section) of the underlying security, provided that the number of shares can be ascertained when the contract is issued, and (B) The contract has a single maturity or exercise date with respect to which all amounts (other than any upfront payment or any periodic payments) are required to be calculated with respect to the underlying security. A contract has a single exercise date even though it may be exercised by the holder at any time on or before the stated expiration of the contract. An NPC or ELI that includes a term that discontinuously increases or decreases the amount paid or received (such as a digital option), or that accelerates or extends the maturity is not a simple contract. A simple contract that is an NPC is a *simple NPC.* A simple contract that is an ELI is a *simple ELI.*

(ii) *Complex contract* - (A) *In general.* A *complex contract* is any NPC or ELI that is not a simple contract. A complex contract that is an NPC is a *complex NPC.* A complex contract that is an ELI is a *complex ELI.*

(B) *Example.* An ELI entitles the long party to a return equal to 200 percent of the appreciation on 100 shares of Stock X, and obligates the long party to pay an amount equal to the actual depreciation on 100 shares of Stock X. Because the ELI does not provide the long party with an amount that is calculated by reference to a single, fixed number of shares of Stock X on the maturity date that can be ascertained at issuance, it is not a simple ELI. More specifically, upon maturity the ELI will either entitle the long party to receive a payment that is, in substance, measured by reference to 200 shares of stock or obligate the long party to make a payment measured by reference to 100 shares of stock. The ELI is a complex ELI because it is not a simple ELI.

(15) *Underlying security.* An *underlying security* is any interest in an entity if a payment with respect to that interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend pursuant to § 1.861-3, where applicable taking into account paragraph (m) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, if a potential section 871(m) transaction references an interest in more than one entity described in the preceding sentence or different interests in the same entity, each referenced interest is a separate underlying security for purposes of applying the rules of this section.

(b) *Source of a dividend equivalent.* A dividend equivalent is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States for purposes of sections 871(a), 881, 892, 894, and 4948(a), and chapters 3 and 4 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code.

(c) *Dividend equivalent* - (1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (2), *dividend equivalent* means -

(i) Any payment that references the payment of a dividend from an underlying security pursuant to a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction;

(ii) Any payment that references the payment of a dividend from an underlying security pursuant to a specified NPC described in paragraph (d) of this section;

(iii) Any payment that references the payment of a dividend from an underlying security pursuant to a specified ELI described in paragraph (e) of this section; and

(iv) Any other substantially similar payment as described in paragraph (f) of this section.

(2) *Exceptions* - (i) *Not a dividend.* A payment that references a distribution with respect to an underlying security is not a dividend equivalent to the extent that the distribution would not be subject to tax pursuant to section 871 or section 881 if the long party owned the underlying security. For example, if an NPC references stock in a regulated investment company that pays a dividend that includes a capital gains dividend described in section 852(b)(3)(C) that would not be subject to tax under section 871 or section 881 if paid directly to the long party, then an NPC payment is not a dividend equivalent to the extent that it is determined by reference to the capital gains dividend.

(ii) *Section 305 coordination.* A dividend equivalent with respect to a section 871(m) transaction is reduced by any amount treated in accordance with section 305(b) and (c) as a dividend with respect to the underlying security referenced by the section 871(m) transaction.

(iii) *Due bills.* A dividend equivalent does not include a payment made pursuant to a due bill arising from the actions of a securities exchange that apply to all transactions in the stock with respect to the dividend. For purposes of this section, a stock will be considered to trade with a due bill only when the relevant securities exchange has set an ex-dividend date with respect to a dividend that occurs after the record date.

(iv) *Certain payments pursuant to annuity, endowment, and life insurance contracts.* [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.871-15T(c)(2)(iv).

(v) *Certain payments pursuant to employee compensation arrangements.* A dividend equivalent does not include the portion of equity-based compensation for personal services of a nonresident alien individual that is -

(A) Wages subject to withholding under section 3402 and the regulations under that section;

(B) Excluded from the definition of wages under § 31.3401(a)(6)-1; or

(C) Exempt from withholding under § 1.1441-4(b).

(d) *Specified NPCs* - (1) *Specified NPCs entered into before January 1, 2017* - (i)*In general.* For payments made after March 18, 2012, and before January 1, 2017, a specified NPC is any NPC if -

(A) In connection with entering into the contract, any long party to the contract transfers the underlying security to any short party to the contract;

(B) In connection with the termination of the contract, any short party to the contract transfers the underlying security to any long party to the contract;

(C) The underlying security is not readily tradable on an established securities market; or

(D) In connection with entering into the contract, the underlying security is posted as collateral by any short party to the contract with any long party to the contract.

(ii) *Specified NPC status as of January 1, 2017.* An NPC that is treated as a specified NPC pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section will remain a specified NPC on or after January 1, 2017.

(2) *Specified NPCs on or after January 1, 2017* - (i) *Simple NPCs.* A simple NPC that has a delta of 0.8 or greater with respect to an underlying security when the NPC is issued is a specified NPC.

(ii) *Complex NPCs.* A complex NPC that meets the substantial equivalence test described in paragraph (h) of this section with respect to an underlying security when the NPC is issued is a specified NPC.

(e) *Specified ELIs* - (1) *Simple ELIs.* A simple ELI that has a delta of 0.8 or greater with respect to an underlying security when the ELI is issued is a specified ELI.

(2) *Complex ELIs.* A complex ELI that meets the substantial equivalence test described in paragraph (h) of this section with respect to an underlying security when the ELI is issued is a specified ELI.

(f) *Other substantially similar payments.* For purposes of this section, any payment made in satisfaction of a tax liability of the long party with respect to a dividend equivalent by a withholding agent is a dividend equivalent received by the long party. The amount of that dividend equivalent constitutes additional income to the payee to the extent provided in § 1.1441-3(f)(1).

(g) *Delta* - (1) *In general.* Delta is the ratio of the change in the fair market value of an NPC or ELI to a small change in the fair market value of the number of shares of the underlying security (as determined under paragraph (j)(3) of this section) referenced by the NPC or ELI. If an NPC or ELI contains more than one reference to a single underlying security, all references to that underlying security are taken into account in determining the delta with respect to that underlying security. If an NPC or ELI references more than one underlying security or other property, the delta with respect to each underlying security must be determined without taking into account any other underlying security or property. The delta of an equity derivative that is embedded in a debt instrument or other derivative is determined without taking into account changes in the market value of the debt instrument or other derivative that are not directly related to the equity element of the instrument. Thus, for example, the delta of an option embedded in a convertible note is determined without regard to the debt component of the convertible note. For purposes of this section, delta must be determined in a commercially reasonable manner. If a taxpayer calculates delta for non-tax business purposes, that delta ordinarily is the delta used for purposes of this section.

(2) *Time for determining delta.* For purposes of applying the rules of this section, the delta of a potential section 871(m) transaction is determined only when the potential section 871(m) transaction is issued (as defined in paragraph (a)(6) of this section).

(3) *Simplified delta calculation for certain simple contracts that reference multiple underlying securities.* If an NPC or ELI references 10 or more underlying securities and the short party uses an exchange-traded security (for example, an exchange-traded fund) that references substantially all of the underlying securities (the hedge security) to hedge the NPC or ELI at the time it is issued, the delta of the NPC or ELI may be calculated by determining the ratio of the change in the fair market value of the simple contract to a small change in the fair market value of the hedge security. A delta determined under this paragraph (g)(3) must be used as the delta for each underlying security for purposes of calculating the amount of a dividend equivalent as provided in paragraph (j)(1)(ii) of this section.

(4) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (g). For purposes of these examples, Stock X and Stock Y are common stock of domestic corporations X and Y. LP is the long party to the transaction.

Example 1.*Delta calculation for an NPC.* The terms of an NPC require LP to pay the short party an amount equal to all of the depreciation in the value of 100 shares of Stock X and an interest-rate based return. In return, the NPC requires the short party to pay LP an amount equal to all of the appreciation in the value of 100 shares of Stock X and any dividends paid by X on those shares. The value of the NPC will change by $1 for each $0.01 change in the price of a share of Stock X. When LP entered into the NPC, Stock X had a fair market value of $50 per share. The NPC therefore has a delta of 1.0 ($1.00/($0.01 × 100)).Example 2.*Delta calculation for an option.* LP purchases a call option that references 100 shares of Stock Y. At the time LP purchases the call option, the value of the option is expected to change by $0.30 for a $0.01 change in the price of a share of Stock Y. When LP purchases the option, Stock Y has a fair market value of $100 per share. The call option has a delta of 0.3 ($0.30/($0.01 × 100)).

(h) *Substantial Equivalence.* [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.871-15T(h).

(i) *Payment of a dividend equivalent* - (1) *Payments determined on gross basis.* For purposes of this section, a payment includes any gross amount that references the payment of a dividend and that is used in computing any net amount transferred to or from the long party even if the long party makes a net payment to the short party or no amount is paid because the net amount is zero.

(2) *Actual and estimated dividends* - (i) *In general.* A payment includes any amount that references an actual or estimated payment of dividends, whether the reference is explicit or implicit. If a potential section 871(m) transaction provides for a payment based on an estimated dividend that adjusts to account for the amount of an actual dividend paid, the payment is treated as referencing the actual dividend amount and not an estimated dividend amount.

(ii) *Implicit dividends.* A payment includes an actual or estimated dividend payment that is implicitly taken into account in computing one or more of the terms of a potential section 871(m) transaction, including interest rate, notional amount, purchase price, premium, upfront payment, strike price, or any other amount paid or received pursuant to the potential section 871(m) transaction.

(iii) *Actual dividend presumption.* A short party to a section 871(m) transaction is treated as paying a per-share dividend amount equal to the actual dividend amount unless the short party to the section 871(m) transaction identifies a reasonable estimated dividend amount in writing at the time the transaction is issued. For this purpose, a reasonable estimated dividend amount stated in an offering document or the documents governing the terms at the time the transaction is issued will establish the estimated dividend amount. To qualify as an estimated dividend amount, the written estimated dividend amount must separately state the amount estimated for each anticipated dividend or state a formula that allows each dividend to be determined. If an underlying security is not expected to pay a dividend, a reasonable estimate of the dividend amount may be zero.

(iv) *Additions to estimated payments.* If a section 871(m) transaction provides for any payment in addition to an estimated dividend and that additional payment is determined by reference to a dividend (for example, a special dividend), both the estimated dividend and the additional payment are used to determine the per-share dividend amount.

(3) *Dividends for certain baskets* - (i) *In general.* If a section 871(m) transaction references long positions in more than 25 underlying securities, the short party may treat the dividends with respect to the referenced underlying securities as paid at the end of the applicable calendar quarter to compute the per-share dividend amount.

(ii) *Publicly available dividend yield.* For purposes of paragraph (i)(3)(i) of this section, if a section 871(m) transaction references the same underlying securities as a security (for example, stock in an exchange-traded fund) or index for which there is a publicly available quarterly dividend yield, the publicly available dividend yield may be used to determine the per-share dividend amount for the section 871(m) transaction with any adjustment for special dividends.

(iii) *Dividend yield for a section 871(m) transaction using the simplified delta calculation.* When the delta of a section 871(m) transaction is determined under paragraph (g)(3) of this section, the per-share dividend amount for that section 871(m) transaction must be determined using the dividend yield for the exchange-traded security that fully hedges the section 871(m) transaction.

(4) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (i). For purposes of these examples, Stock X is common stock of Corporation X, a domestic corporation, that historically pays quarterly dividends on Stock X. The parties anticipate that Corporation X will continue to pay quarterly dividends.

Example 1.*Forward contract to purchase domestic stock.* (i) When Stock X is trading at $50 per share, Foreign Investor enters into a forward contract to purchase 100 shares of Stock X in one year. Reasonable estimates of the quarterly dividend are specified in the transaction documents. The price in the forward contract is determined by multiplying the number of shares referenced in the contract by the current price of the shares and an interest rate, and subtracting the value of any dividends expected to be paid during the term of the contract. Assuming that the forward contract is priced using an interest rate of 4 percent and total estimated dividends with a future value of $1 per share during the term of the forward contract, the purchase price set in the forward contract is $5,100 (100 shares × $50 per share × 1.04 − ($1 × 100)).

(ii) Subject to paragraph (i)(2)(iv) of this section, the estimated dividend amounts are the per-share dividend amounts because the estimates are reasonable and specified in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section. The estimated per-share dividend amounts are dividend equivalents for purposes of this section.

Example 2.*Price return only swap contract.* (i) Foreign Investor enters into a price return swap contract that entitles Foreign Investor to receive payments based on the appreciation in the value of 100 shares of Stock X and requires Foreign Investor to pay an amount based on LIBOR plus any depreciation in the value of Stock X. The swap contract neither explicitly entitles Foreign Investor to payments based on dividends paid on Stock X during the term of the contract nor references an estimated dividend amount. The LIBOR rate in the swap contract, however, is reduced to reflect expected annual dividends on Stock X.

(ii) Because the LIBOR leg of the swap contract is reduced to reflect estimated dividends and the estimated dividend amounts are not specified, Foreign Investor is treated as receiving the actual dividend amounts are in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The actual per-share dividend amounts are dividend equivalents for purposes of this section.

(j) *Amount of dividend equivalent* - (1) *Calculation of the amount of a dividend equivalent* - (i) *Securities lending or sale-repurchase transactions.* For a securities lending or sale-repurchase transaction, the amount of the dividend equivalent for each underlying security equals the amount of the actual per-share dividend paid on the underlying security multiplied by the number of shares of the underlying security.

(ii) *Simple contracts.* For a simple contract that is a section 871(m) transaction, the amount of the dividend equivalent for each underlying security equals:

(A) The per-share dividend amount (as determined under either paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section) with respect to the underlying security multiplied by;

(B) The number of shares of the underlying security multiplied by;

(C) The delta of the section 871(m) transaction with respect to the underlying security.

(iii) *Complex contracts.* For a complex contract that is a section 871(m) transaction, the amount of the dividend equivalent for each underlying security equals:

(A) The per-share dividend amount (as determined under paragraph (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section) with respect to the underlying security multiplied by;

(B) The initial hedge for the underlying security.

(iv) *Other substantially similar payments.* In addition to any amount determined pursuant to paragraph (j)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii), the amount of a dividend equivalent includes the amount of any payment described in paragraph (f) of this section.

(2) *Time for determining the amount of a dividend equivalent.* The amount of a dividend equivalent is determined on the earlier of the date that is the record date of the dividend and the day prior to the ex-dividend date with respect to the dividend. For example, if a specified NPC provides for a payment at settlement that takes into account an earlier dividend payment, the amount of the dividend equivalent is determined on the earlier of the record date or the day prior to the ex-dividend date for that dividend.

(3) *Number of shares.* The number of shares of an underlying security generally is the number of shares of the underlying security stated in the contract. If the transaction modifies that number by a factor or fraction or otherwise alters the amount of any payment, the number of shares is adjusted to take into account the factor, fraction, or other modification. For example, in a transaction in which the long party receives or makes payments based on 200 percent of the appreciation or depreciation (as applicable) of 100 shares of stock, the number of shares of the underlying security is 200 shares of the stock.

(k) *Limitation on the treatment of certain corporate acquisitions as section 871(m) transactions.* A potential section 871(m) transaction is not a section 871(m) transaction with respect to an underlying security if the transaction obligates the long party to acquire ownership of the underlying security as part of a plan pursuant to which one or more persons (including the long party) are obligated to acquire underlying securities representing more than 50 percent of the value of the entity issuing the underlying securities.

(l) *Rules relating to indices* - (1) *Purpose.* The purpose of this section is to provide a safe harbor for potential section 871(m) transactions that reference certain passive indices that are based on a diverse basket of publicly-traded securities and that are widely used by numerous market participants. Notwithstanding any other provision in this paragraph (l), an index is not a qualified index if treating the index as a qualified index would be contrary to the purpose described in this paragraph.

(2) *Qualified index not treated as an underlying security.* For purposes of this section, a qualified index is treated as a single security that is not an underlying security. The determination of whether an index referenced in a potential section 871(m) transaction is a qualified index is made at the time the transaction is issued based on whether the index is a qualified index on the first business day of the calendar year in which the transaction is issued.

(3) *Qualified index.* A *qualified index* means an index that -

(i) References 25 or more component securities (whether or not the security is an underlying security);

(ii) Except as provided in paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section, references only long positions in component securities;

(iii) References no component underlying security that represents more than 15 percent of the weighting of the component securities in the index;

(iv) References no five or fewer component underlying securities that together represent more than 40 percent of the weighting of the component securities in the index;

(v) Is modified or rebalanced only according to publicly stated, predefined criteria, which may require interpretation by the index provider or a board or committee responsible for maintaining the index;

(vi) Did not provide an annual dividend yield in the immediately preceding calendar year from component underlying securities that is greater than 1.5 times the annual dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index as reported for the immediately preceding calendar year; and

(vii) Is traded through futures contracts or option contracts (regardless of whether the contracts provide price only or total return exposure to the index or provide for dividend reinvestment in the index) on -

(A) A national securities exchange that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or a domestic board of trade designated as a contract market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission; or

(B) A foreign exchange or board of trade that is a qualified board or exchange as determined by the Secretary pursuant to section 1256(g)(7)(C) or that has a staff no action letter from the CFTC permitting direct access from the United States that is effective on the applicable testing date, provided that the referenced component underlying securities, in the aggregate, comprise less than 50 percent of the weighting of the component securities in the index.

(4) *Safe harbor for certain indices that reference assets other than underlying securities.* Notwithstanding paragraph (l)(3) of this section, an index is a qualified index if the referenced component underlying securities in the aggregate comprise 10 percent or less of the weighting of the component securities in the index.

(5) *Weighting of component securities.* For purposes of this paragraph (l), the weighting of a component security of an index is the percentage of the index's value represented, or accounted for, by the component security.

(6) *Transactions that reference a qualified index and one or more component securities or indices* - (i) *In general.* When a potential section 871(m) transaction references a qualified index and one or more component securities or other indices, the qualified index remains a qualified index only if the potential section 871(m) transaction does not reference a short position in any referenced component security of the qualified index, other than a short position with respect to the entire qualified index (for example, a cap or floor) or a de minimis short position described in paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section. If, in connection with a potential section 871(m) transaction that references a qualified index, a taxpayer (or a related person within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) enters into one or more transactions that reduce exposure to any referenced component security of the index, other than transactions that reduce exposure to the entire index, then the potential section 871(m) transaction is not treated as referencing a qualified index.

(ii) *Safe harbor for de minimis short positions.* Notwithstanding paragraphs (l)(3)(ii) and (l)(6)(i) of this section, an index may be a qualified index if the short position (whether part of the index or entered into separately by the taxpayer or related person within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) reduces exposure to referenced component securities of a qualified index (excluding any short positions with respect to the entire qualified index) by five percent or less of the value of the long positions in component securities in the qualified index.

(7) *Transactions that indirectly reference a qualified index.* If a potential section 871(m) transaction references a security (for example, stock in an exchange-traded fund) that tracks a qualified index, the potential section 871(m) transaction will be treated as referencing a qualified index.

(m) *Rules relating to derivatives that reference partnerships* - (1) *In general.* When a potential section 871(m) transaction references a partnership interest, the assets of the partnership will be treated as referenced by the potential section 871(m) transaction only if the partnership carries on a trade or business of dealing or trading in securities, holds significant investments in securities (either of which is a covered partnership), or directly or indirectly holds an interest in a lower-tier partnership that is a covered partnership. For purposes of this section, if a covered partnership directly or indirectly holds assets that are underlying securities or potential section 871(m) transactions, any potential section 871(m) transaction that references an interest in the covered partnership is treated as referencing the shares of the underlying securities, including underlying securities of potential section 871(m) transactions, directly or indirectly allocable to that partnership interest. For purposes of this paragraph (m), a security is defined in section 475(c).

(2) *Significant investments in securities* - (i) *In general.* For purposes of this paragraph (m), a partnership holds significant investments in securities if either -

(A) 25 percent or more of the value of the partnership's assets consist of underlying securities or potential section 871(m) transactions; or

(B) The value of the underlying securities or potential section 871(m) transactions equals or exceeds $25 million.

(ii) *Determining the value of the partnership's assets.* For purposes of this paragraph (m)(2), the value of a partnership's assets is determined at the time the potential 871(m) transaction referencing that partnership interest is issued based on the value of the assets held by the partnership on the last day of the partnership's prior taxable year unless the long party or the short party has actual knowledge that a subsequent transaction has caused the partnership to cross either of the thresholds described in paragraph (m)(2)(i). The value of a partnership's assets is equal to their fair market value, except that the value of any NPC, futures contract, forward contract, option, and any similar financial instrument held by the partnership is deemed to be the value of the notional securities referenced by the transaction.

(n) *Combined transactions* - (1) *In general.* For purposes of determining whether a potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction, two or more potential section 871(m) transactions are treated as a single transaction with respect to an underlying security when -

(i) A person (or a related person within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) is the long party with respect to the underlying security for each potential section 871(m) transaction;

(ii) The potential section 871(m) transactions reference the same underlying security;

(iii) The potential section 871(m) transactions, when combined, replicate the economics of a transaction that would be a section 871(m) transaction if the transactions had been entered into as a single transaction; and

(iv) The potential section 871(m) transactions are entered into in connection with each other (regardless of whether the transactions are entered into simultaneously or with the same counterparty).

(2) *Section 871(m) transactions.* If a potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction, either by itself or as a result of a combination with one or more other potential section 871(m) transactions, it does not cease to be a section 871(m) transaction as a result of applying paragraph (n) of this section or disposing of one or more of the potential section 871(m) transaction with which it is combined.

(3) *Short party presumptions regarding combined transactions* - (i) *Transactions in separate accounts.* A short party that is a broker may presume that transactions are not entered into in connection with each other for purposes of paragraph (n)(1) of this section if a long party holds or reflects the transactions in separate accounts maintained by the short party, unless the short party has actual knowledge that the transactions held or reflected in separate accounts by the long party were entered into in connection with each other or that separate accounts were created or used to avoid section 871(m).

(ii) *Transactions separated by at least two business days.* A short party that is a broker may presume that transactions entered into two or more business days apart are not entered into in connection with each other for purposes of paragraph (n)(1) of this section unless the short party has actual knowledge that the transactions were entered into in connection with each other.

(4) *Presumptions Commissioner will apply to long party* - (i) *Transactions in separate trading books.* The Commissioner will presume that a long party did not enter into two or more transactions in connection with each other for purposes of paragraph (n)(1) of this section if the long party properly reflected those transactions on separate trading books. The Commissioner may rebut this presumption with facts and circumstances showing that transactions reflected on separate trading books were entered into in connection with each other or that separate trading books were created or used to avoid section 871(m).

(ii) *Transactions separated by at least two days.* The Commissioner will presume that a long party did not enter into two or more transactions in connection with each other for purposes of paragraph (n)(1) of this section if the long party entered into the transactions two or more business days apart. The Commissioner may rebut this presumption with facts and circumstances showing that the transactions entered into two or more business days apart were entered into in connection with each other.

(iii) *Transactions separated by less than two days and reflected in the same trading book.* The Commissioner will presume that transactions that are entered into less than two business days apart and reflected on the same trading book are entered into in connection with each other. A long party can rebut this presumption with facts and circumstances showing that the transactions were not entered into in connection with each other.

(5) *Rules of application* - (i) *Two business days rule.* For the purpose of determining the number of business days between transactions, the short party may, and the Commissioner will, assume that all transactions are entered into at 4:00 p.m. on the date the transaction becomes effective in the jurisdiction of the long party.

(ii) *No long party presumptions.* Notwithstanding the presumptions described in paragraphs (n)(3) and (n)(4) of this section, the long party must treat two or more transactions as combined transactions if the transactions are described in paragraph (n)(1) of section.

(6) *Ordering rule for transactions entered into in connection with each other.* If a long party enters into more than two potential section 871(m) transactions that could be combined under this paragraph (n), a short party is required to apply paragraph (n)(1) of this section by combining transactions in a manner that results in the most transactions with a delta of 0.8 or higher with respect to the referenced underlying security. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer has sold one at-the-money put and purchased two at-the-money calls, each with respect to 100 shares of the same underlying security, the put and one call are combined. Similarly, a purchased call on 100 shares and a sold put on 200 shares of the same underlying security can be combined for 100 shares with 100 shares of the put remaining separate. The two calls are not combined because they do not provide the long party with economic exposure to depreciation in the underlying security. Similarly, if a long party enters into more than two potential section 871(m) transactions that could be combined under this paragraph (n), but have not been combined by a short party, the long party is required to apply paragraph (n)(1) of this section by combining transactions in a manner that results in the most transactions with a delta of 0.8 or higher with respect to the referenced underlying security.

(7) *More than one underlying security referenced.* If potential section 871(m) transactions reference more than one underlying security, paragraph (n)(1) of this section applies separately with respect to each underlying security.

(o) *Anti-abuse rule.* If a taxpayer (directly or through the use of a related person within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b)) acquires (whether by entering into, purchasing, accepting by transfer, by exchange, or by conversion, or otherwise acquiring) or disposes of (whether by sale, offset, exercise, termination, expiration, maturity, or other means) a transaction or transactions with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of this section, the Commissioner may treat any payment (as described in paragraph (i) of this section) made with respect to that transaction or transactions as a dividend equivalent to the extent necessary to prevent the avoidance of this section. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Commissioner may, for example, adjust the delta of a transaction, change the number of shares, adjust an estimated dividend amount, change the maturity, adjust the timing of payments, treat a transaction that references a partnership interest as referencing the assets of the partnership, combine, separate, or disregard transactions, indices, or components of indices to reflect the substance of the transaction or transactions, or otherwise depart from the rules of this section as necessary to determine whether the transaction includes a dividend equivalent or the amount or timing of a dividend equivalent. A purpose may be a principal purpose even though it is outweighed by other purposes (taken together or separately). When a withholding agent knows that the taxpayer acquired or disposed of a transaction or transactions with a principal purpose of avoiding the application of this section and the Commissioner treats a payment made with respect to any transaction as a dividend equivalent, the withholding agent may be liable for any tax pursuant to section 1461.

(p) *Information required to be reported regarding a potential section 871(m) transaction* - (1) *In general.* If a broker or dealer is a party to a potential section 871(m) transaction with a counterparty or customer that is not a broker or dealer, the broker or dealer is required to determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction. If both parties to a potential section 871(m) transaction are brokers or dealers, or neither party to a potential section 871(m) transaction is a broker or dealer, the short party must determine whether the potential section 871(m) transaction is a section 871(m) transaction. The party to the transaction that is required to determine whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction must also determine and report to the counterparty or customer the timing and amount of any dividend equivalent (as described in paragraphs (i) and (j) of this section). Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (n)(3) of this section, the party required to make the determinations described in this paragraph is required to exercise reasonable diligence to determine whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction, the amount of any dividend equivalents, and any other information necessary to apply the rules of this section. The information must be provided in the manner prescribed in paragraphs (p)(2) and (p)(3) of this section. The determinations required by paragraph (p) of this section are binding on the parties to the potential section 871(m) transaction and on any person who is a withholding agent with respect to the potential section 871(m) transaction unless the person knows or has reason to know that the information received is incorrect. The determinations are not binding on the Commissioner.

(2) *Reporting requirements.* For rules regarding the reporting requirements of withholding agents with respect to dividend equivalents described in this section, see §§ 1.1461-1(b) and (c) and 1.1474-1(c) and (d).

(3) *Additional information available to a party to a potential section 871(m) transaction* - (i) *In general.* Upon request by any person described in paragraph (p)(3)(ii) of this section, the party required to report information pursuant to paragraph (p)(1) of this section must provide the requester with information regarding the amount of each dividend equivalent, the delta of the potential section 871(m) transaction, the amount of any tax withheld and deposited, the estimated dividend amount if specified in accordance with paragraph (i)(2)(iii) of this section, the identity of any transactions combined pursuant to paragraph (n) of this section, and any other information necessary to apply the rules of this section. The information requested must be provided within a reasonable time, not to exceed 10 business days, and communicated in one or more of the following ways:

(A) By telephone, and confirmed in writing;

(B) By written statement sent by first class mail to the address provided by the requesting party;

(C) By electronic publication available to all persons entitled to request information; or

(D) By any other method agreed to by the parties, and confirmed in writing.

(ii) *Persons entitled to request information.* Any party to the transaction described in paragraph (a)(9) of this section may request the information specified in paragraph (p) of this section with respect to a potential section 871(m) transaction from the party required by paragraph (p)(3)(i) of this section to provide the information.

(iii) *Reliance on information received.* A person described in paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(ii) of this section that receives information described in paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(i) of this section may rely on that information to provide information to any other person unless the recipient knows or has reason to know that the information received is incorrect. When the recipient knows or has reason to know that the information received is incorrect, the recipient must make a reasonable effort to determine and provide the information described in paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(i) of this section to any person described in paragraph (p)(1) or (p)(3)(ii) of this section that requests information from the recipient.

(4) *Recordkeeping rules* - (i) *In general.* For rules regarding recordkeeping requirements sufficient to establish whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction and whether a payment is a dividend equivalent and the amount of gross income treated as a dividend equivalent, see § 1.6001-1.

(ii) *Records sufficient to establish whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction and any dividend equivalent amount.* Any person required to retain records must keep sufficient information to establish whether a transaction is a section 871(m) transaction and the amount of a dividend equivalent (if any), including documentation and work papers supporting the delta calculation or the substantial equivalence test (including the number of shares of the initial hedge), as applicable, and written estimated dividends (if any). The records and documentation must be created substantially contemporaneously. A record will be considered to have been created substantially contemporaneously if it was created within 10 business days of the date the potential section 871(m) transaction is issued.
