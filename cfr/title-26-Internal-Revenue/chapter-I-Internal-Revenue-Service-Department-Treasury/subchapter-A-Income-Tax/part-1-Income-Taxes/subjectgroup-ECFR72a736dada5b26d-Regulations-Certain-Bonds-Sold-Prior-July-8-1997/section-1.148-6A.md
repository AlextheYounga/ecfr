(d)(3)(iii)(C) *Qualified endowment funds treated as unavailable.* For a 501(c)(3) organization, a qualified endowment fund is treated as unavailable. A fund is a qualified endowment fund if -

(*2*) Pursuant to reasonable, established practices of the organization, the governing body of the 501(c)(3) organization designates and consistently operates the fund as a permanent endowment fund or quasi-endowment fund restricted as to use; and

(*3*) There is an independent verification (e.g., from an independent certified public accountant) that the fund is reasonably necessary as part of the organization's permanent capital.
