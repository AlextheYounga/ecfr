##### § 1.1502-30 Stock basis after certain triangular reorganizations. #####

(a) *Scope.* This section provides rules for determining the basis of the stock of an acquiring corporation as a result of a triangular reorganization. The definitions and nomenclature contained in § 1.358-6 apply to this section.

(b) *General rules*—(1) *Forward triangular merger, triangular C reorganization, or triangular B reorganization. P* adjusts its basis in the stock of S as a result of a forward triangular merger, triangular C reorganization, or triangular B reorganization under § 1.358-6(c) and (d), except that § 1.358-6 (c)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) do not apply. Instead, *P* adjusts such basis by taking into account the full amount of—

(i) *T* liabilities assumed by *S* or the amount of liabilities to which the *T* assets acquired by *S* are subject, and

(ii) The fair market value of any consideration not provided by *P* pursuant to the plan of reorganization.

(2) *Reverse triangular merger.* If *P* adjusts its basis in the *T* stock acquired as a result of a reverse triangular merger under § 1.358-6 (c)(2)(i) and (d), § 1.358-6 (c)(1)(ii) and (d)(2) do not apply. Instead, *P* adjusts such basis by taking into account the full amount of—

(i) *T* liabilities deemed assumed by *S* or the amount of liabilities to which the *T* assets deemed acquired by *S* are subject, and

(ii) The fair market value of any consideration not provided by *P* pursuant to the plan of reorganization.

(3) *Excess loss accounts.* Negative adjustments under this section may exceed *P*'s basis in its *S* or *T* stock. The resulting negative amount is *P*'s excess loss account in its *S* or *T* stock. See § 1.1502-19 for rules treating excess loss accounts as negative basis, and treating references to stock basis as including references to excess loss accounts.

(4) *Application of other rules of law.* If a transaction otherwise subject to this section is also a group structure change subject to § 1.1502-31, the provisions of § 1.1502-31 and not this section apply to determine stock basis. See § 1.1502-80(a) regarding the general applicability of other rules of law and a limitation on duplicative adjustments. See § 1.1502-80(d) for the non-application of section 357(c) to P.

(5) *Examples.* The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples. For purposes of these examples, *P, S,* and *T* are domestic corporations, *P* and *S* file consolidated returns, *P* owns all of the only class of *S* stock, the *P* stock exchanged in the transaction satisfies the requirements of the applicable triangular reorganization provisions, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, and tax liabilities are disregarded.

Example 1. Liabilities.(a) *Facts. T* has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100. *T*'s assets are subject to $70 of liabilities. Pursuant to a plan, *P* forms *S* with $5 of cash (which S retains), and *T* merges into *S.* In the merger, the *T* shareholders receive *P* stock worth $30 in exchange for their *T* stock. The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) apply.

(b) *Basis adjustment.* Under § 1.358-6, *P* adjusts its $5 basis in the *S* stock as if *P* had acquired the *T* assets with a carryover basis under section 362 and transferred these assets to *S* in a transaction in which *P* determines its basis in the *S* stock under section 358. Under the rules of this section, the limitation described in § 1.358-6(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Thus, *P* adjusts its basis in the *S* stock by -$10 (the aggregate adjusted basis of *T*'s assets decreased by the amount of liabilities to which the *T* assets are subject). Consequently, as a result of the reorganization, *P* has an excess loss account of $5 in its *S* stock.

Example 2. Consideration not provided by P.(a) *Facts. T* has assets with an aggregate basis of $10 and fair market value of $100 and no liabilities. *S* is an operating company with substantial assets that has been in existence for several years. *P* has a $5 basis in its *S* stock. Pursuant to a plan, *T* merges into *S* and the *T* shareholders receive $70 of *P* stock provided by *P* pursuant to the plan of reorganization and $30 of cash provided by *S* in exchange for their *T* stock. The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(D) apply.

(b) *Basis adjustment.* Under § 1.358-6, *P* adjusts its $5 basis in the *S* stock as if *P* had acquired the *T* assets with a carryover basis under section 362 and transferred these assets to *S* in a transaction in which *P* determines its basis in the *S* stock under section 358. Under the rules of this section, the limitation described in § 1.358-6(d)(2) does not apply. Thus, *P* adjusts its basis in the *S* stock by -$20 (the aggregate adjusted basis of *T*'s assets decreased by the fair market value of the consideration provided by *S*). As a result of the reorganization, *P* has an excess loss account of $15 in its *S* stock.

(c) *Appreciated asset.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (a) of this *Example 2,* except that in the reorganization *S* provides an asset with a $20 adjusted basis and $30 fair market value instead of $30 cash. The basis is adjusted in the same manner as in paragraph (b) of this *Example 2.* In addition, because *S* recognizes a $10 gain from the asset under section 1001, *P*'s basis in its *S* stock is increased under § 1.1502-32(b) by *S*'s $10 gain. Consequently, as a result of the reorganization, *P* has an excess loss account of $5 in its *S* stock. (The results would be the same if the appreciated asset provided by *S* was *P* stock with respect to which *S* recognized gain. See § 1.1032-2(c)).

Example 3. Reverse triangular merger.(a) *Facts. T* has assets with an aggregate basis of $60 and fair market value of $100. *T*'s assets are subject to $70 of liabilities. *P* owns all of the only class of *S* stock. *P* has a $5 basis in its *S* stock. Pursuant to a plan, *S* merges into *T* with *T* surviving. In the merger, the *T* shareholders exchange their *T* stock for $2 cash from *P* and $28 worth of *P* stock provided by *P* pursuant to the plan. The transaction is a reorganization to which sections 368 (a)(1)(A) and (a)(2)(E) apply.

(b) *Basis adjustment.* Under § 1.358-6, *P*'s basis in the *T* stock acquired equals its $5 basis in its *S* stock immediately before the transaction adjusted by the $60 basis in the *T* assets deemed transferred, and the $70 of liabilities to which the *T* assets are subject. Under the rules of this section, the limitation described in § 1.358-6(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Consequently, *P* has an excess loss account of $5 in its *T* stock as a result of the transaction.

(c) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies to reorganizations occurring on or after December 21, 1995. However, paragraph (b)(4) of this section applies to reorganizations occurring on or after September 17, 2008.
