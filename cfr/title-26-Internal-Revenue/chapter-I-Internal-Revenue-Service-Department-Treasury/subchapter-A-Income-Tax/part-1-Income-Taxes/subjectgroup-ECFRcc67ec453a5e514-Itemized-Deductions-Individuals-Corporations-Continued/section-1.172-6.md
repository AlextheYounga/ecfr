##### § 1.172-6 Illustration of net operating loss carrybacks and carryovers. #####

The application of § 1.172-4 may be illustrated by the following example:

(a) *Facts.* The books of the taxpayer, whose return is made on the basis of the calendar year, reveal the following facts:

|Taxable year|Taxable income|Net operating loss|
|------------|--------------|------------------|
|    1954    |   $15,000    |                  |
|    1955    |    30,000    |                  |
|    1956    |              |    ($75,000)     |
|    1957    |    20,000    |                  |
|    1958    |              |    (150,000)     |
|    1959    |    30,000    |                  |
|    1960    |    35,000    |                  |
|    1961    |    75,000    |                  |
|    1962    |    17,000    |                  |
|    1963    |    53,000    |                  |

The taxable income thus shown is computed without any net operating loss deduction. The assumption is also made that none of the other modifications prescribed in § 1.172-5 apply. There are no net operating losses for 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1964, 1965, or 1966.

(b) *Loss sustained in 1956.* The portions of the $75,000 net operating loss for 1956 which shall be used as carrybacks to 1954 and 1955 and as carryovers to 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, and 1961 are computed as follows:

(1) *Carryback to 1954.* The carryback to this year is $75,000, that is, the amount of the net operating loss.

(2) *Carryback to 1955.* The carryback to this year is $60,000, computed as follows:

|                                Net operating loss                                 |$75,000|
