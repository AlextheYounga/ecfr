(ii) *Exception for similar items.* The donor may attach a single Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) for all similar items of property, as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(iii), contributed to the same donee during the donor's taxable year, if the donor includes on Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) the information required by paragraph (c)(3) or (d)(3) of this section for each item of property.

(3) *Substantiation requirements for carryovers of noncash contribution deductions.* The rules in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section (regarding substantiation that must be submitted with a return) also apply to the return for any carryover year under section 170(d).

(4) *Partners and S corporation shareholders*—(i) *Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) must be provided to partners and S corporation shareholders.* If the donor is a partnership or S corporation, the donor must provide a copy of the completed Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) to every partner or shareholder who receives an allocation of a charitable contribution deduction under section 170 for the property described in Form 8283 (Section A or Section B). Similarly, a recipient partner or shareholder that is a partnership or S corporation must provide a copy of the completed Form 8283 (Section A or Section B) to each of its partners or shareholders who receives an allocation of a charitable contribution deduction under section 170 for the property described in Form 8283 (Section A or Section B).

(5) *Determination of deduction amount for purposes of substantiation rules*—(i) *In general.* In determining whether the amount of a donor's deduction exceeds the amounts set forth in section 170(f)(11)(B) (noncash contributions exceeding $500), 170(f)(11)(C) (noncash contributions exceeding $5,000), or 170(f)(11)(D) (noncash contributions exceeding $500,000), the rules of paragraphs (f)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this section apply.

(ii) *Similar items of property must be aggregated.* Under section 170(f)(11)(F), the donor must aggregate the amount claimed as a deduction for all similar items of property, as defined in § 1.170A-13(c)(7)(iii), contributed during the taxable year. For rules regarding the number of qualified appraisals and Forms 8283 (Section A or Section B) required if similar items of property are contributed, see § 1.170A-13(c)(3)(iv)(A) and (4)(iv)(B).

(iii) *For contributions of certain inventory and scientific property, excess of amount claimed over cost of goods sold taken into account*—(A) *In general.* In determining the amount of a donor's contribution of property to which section 170(e)(3) (relating to contributions of inventory and other property) or (e)(4) (relating to contributions of scientific property used for research) applies, the donor must take into account only the excess of the amount claimed as a deduction over the amount that would have been treated as the cost of goods sold if the donor had sold the contributed property to the donee.

(B) *Example.* The following example illustrates the rule of this paragraph (f)(5)(iii):

Example.*X* Corporation makes a contribution of inventory described in section 1221(a)(2). The contribution, described in section 170(e)(3), is for the care of the needy. The cost of the property to *X* Corporation is $5,000 and the fair market value of the property at the time of the contribution is $11,000. Pursuant to section 170(e)(3)(B), *X* Corporation claims a charitable contribution deduction of $8,000 ($5,000 +1/2 × ($11,000 − 5,000) = $8,000). The amount taken into account for purposes of determining the $5,000 threshold of paragraph (d) of this section is $3,000 ($8,000−$5,000).

(g) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies to contributions made after July 30, 2018. Taxpayers may rely on the rules of this section for contributions made after June 3, 2004, or appraisals prepared for returns or submissions filed after August 17, 2006.
