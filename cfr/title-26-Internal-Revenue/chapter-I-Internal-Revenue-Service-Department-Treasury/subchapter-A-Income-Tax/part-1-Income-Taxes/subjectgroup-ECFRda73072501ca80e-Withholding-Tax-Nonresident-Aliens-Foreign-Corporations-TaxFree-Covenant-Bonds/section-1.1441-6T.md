##### § 1.1441-6T Claim of reduced withholding under an income tax treaty (temporary). #####

(a) through (b)(1) introductory text [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.1441-6(a) through (b)(1) introductory text.

(i) *Identification of limitation on benefits provisions.* In conjunction with the representation that the beneficial owner meets the limitation on benefits provision of the applicable treaty, if any, required by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a beneficial owner withholding certificate must also identify the specific limitation on benefits provision of the article (if any, or a similar provision) of the treaty upon which the beneficial owner relies to claim the treaty benefit. A withholding agent may rely on the beneficial owner's claim regarding its reliance on a specific limitation on benefits provision absent actual knowledge that such claim is unreliable or incorrect.

(ii) *Reason to know based on existence of treaty.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1), a withholding agent's reason to know that a beneficial owner's claim to a reduced rate of withholding under an income tax treaty is unreliable or incorrect includes a circumstance where the beneficial owner is claiming benefits under an income tax treaty that does not exist or is not in force. A withholding agent may determine whether a tax treaty is in existence and is in force by checking the list maintained on the IRS Web site at *https://www.irs.gov/businesses/international-businesses/united-states-income-tax-treaties-a-to-z* (or any replacement page on the IRS Web site) or in the State Department's annual Treaties in Force publication.

(b)(2)(i) through (iv) Example 3 [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.1441-6(b)(2)(i) through (b)(2)(iv) Example 3.

Example 4.(i) *Facts.* Entity E is a business organization formed under the laws of country Y. Country Y has an income tax treaty with the United States that contains a limitation on benefits provision. E receives U.S. source royalties from withholding agent W. E furnishes a beneficial owner withholding certificate to W claiming a reduced rate of withholding under the U.S.-Y tax treaty. However, E's beneficial owner withholding certificate does not specifically identify the limitation on benefits provision that E satisfies.

(ii) *Analysis.* Because E's withholding certificate does not specifically identify the limitation on benefits provision under the U.S.-Y tax treaty that E satisfies as required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, W cannot rely on E's withholding certificate to apply the reduced rate of withholding claimed by E.

(c) introductory text through (c)(4) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.1441-6(c) through (c)(4).

(5) *Statements regarding entitlement to treaty benefits* - (i) *Statement regarding conditions under a limitation on benefits provision.* In addition to the documentary evidence described in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a taxpayer that is not an individual must provide a statement that it meets one or more of the conditions set forth in the limitation on benefits article (if any, or in a similar provision) contained in the applicable tax treaty and must identify the specific limitation on benefits provision of the article (if any, or a similar provision) of the treaty upon which the taxpayer relies to claim the treaty benefit.

(c)(5)(ii) through (i)(2) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.1441-6(c)(5)(ii) through (i)(2).

(3) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies on January 6, 2017.

(j) *Expiration date.* The applicability of this section expires on December 30, 2019.
