##### § 1.6049-4T Return of information as to interest paid and original issue discount includible in gross income after December 31, 1982 (temporary). #####

(a) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.6049-4(a).

(b) *Information to be reported* - (1) *Interest payments.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3) and (5) of this section, in the case of interest other than original issue discount treated as interest under § 1.6049-5(f), an information return on Form 1099 shall be made for the calendar year showing the aggregate amount of the payments, the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the person to whom paid, the amount of tax deducted and withheld under section 3406 from the payments, if any, and such other information as required by the forms. An information return is generally not required if the amount of interest paid to a person aggregates less than $10 or if the payment is made to a person who is an exempt recipient described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, unless the payor backup withholds under section 3406 on such payment (because, for example, the payee (that is, exempt recipient) has failed to furnish a Form W-9 on request), in which case the payor must make a return under this section, unless the payor refunds the amount withheld pursuant to § 31.6413(a)-3 (Employment Tax Regulations). For reporting interest paid to certain nonresident alien individuals, see § 1.6049-8.

(2) through (c)(3) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.6049-4(b)(2) through (c)(3).

(4) *Coordination of reporting with chapter 4 reporting or an applicable IGA* - (i) *U.S. accounts reported by FFIs that are non-U.S. payors.* An information return shall not be required with respect to an interest payment made by a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI), or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI), that is a non-U.S. payor (as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(5)) to an account holder of an account maintained by the FFI, when the payment is not subject to withholding under chapter 4 or to backup withholding under section 3406, and the conditions of paragraphs (c)(4)(i)(A), (B), or (C), as applicable, are met. See paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section for circumstances in which an FFI may allocate a payment described in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees.

(A) The FFI is a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) reporting the account holder of the U.S. account (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(133)) pursuant to either § 1.1471-4(d)(3) or (5) for the year in which the payment is made (including reporting of the account holder's TIN).

(B) The FFI is a registered deemed-compliant FFI (other than a reporting Model 1 FFI) reporting the account holder of the U.S. account pursuant to the conditions of its applicable deemed-compliant status under § 1.1471-5(f)(1) for the year in which the payment is made (including reporting of the account holder's TIN).

(C) The FFI is a reporting Model 1 FFI reporting the account holder of the reportable U.S. account pursuant to an applicable Model 1 IGA for the year in which the payment is made (including reporting of the account holder's TIN).

(ii) *Other accounts reported by FFIs under chapter 4.* An information return shall not be required under this section with respect to a payment that is not subject to withholding under chapter 3 (as defined in § 1.1441-2(a)) or backup withholding under § 31.3406(g)-1(e) and that is made to a recalcitrant account holder of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (or non-consenting U.S. account of a reporting Model 2 FFI), provided that the FFI reports such account holder in accordance with the classes of account holders described in § 1.1471-4(d)(6) for the year in which the payment is made. See paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section for circumstances in which an FFI may allocate a payment described in this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees. In the case of a payment made by an FFI that is a reporting Model 1 FFI, an information return shall not be required with respect to a payment that is not subject to withholding under chapter 3 or backup withholding under § 31.3406(g)-1(e) and that is made to an account holder of the FFI if the account -

(A) Has U.S. indicia for which appropriate documentation sufficient to treat the account as held by other than a specified U.S. person has not been provided pursuant to the due diligence requirements described in an applicable Model 1 IGA and,

(B) Is therefore treated as a U.S. reportable account that the FFI is required to report pursuant to the applicable Model 1 IGA.

(iii) *Coordination of reporting exceptions with reporting of chapter 4 withholding rate pools.* For purposes of paragraphs (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section, a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) receiving a payment from another payor may provide a withholding statement to the payor allocating the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate of pool of U.S. payees only if the payment is excepted from reporting under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section or if the payment is both excepted from reporting under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section and not subject to withholding under chapter 4. See § 1.6049-5(b)(14) (providing an exception from reporting under section 6049 to a payor that has been furnished a withholding statement from an participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a reporting Model 1 FFI) and that allocates the payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool). Thus, for example, a U.S. payor that is a participating FFI may not allocate a payment to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees on a withholding statement described in § 1.6049-5(b)(14) when the payment is made to a U.S. account maintained by the FFI, regardless of whether the FFI reports the account in accordance with § 1.1471-4(d)(3) because the U.S. payor is not excepted from reporting under this section pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section.

(iv) *Example.* The application of the provisions of paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) and (iii) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.USP is a payor that makes an interest payment that is not a withholdable payment (as defined in paragraph (f)(15) of this section) to RM2, a U.S. payor and reporting Model 2 FFI. The payment is paid and received outside of the United States and is not an amount subject to withholding under chapter 3. RM2 receives the payment as an intermediary on behalf of its account holder, A. RM2 has account information with respect to A which includes U.S. indicia as described in § 1.1441-7(b)(5) or (8). Additionally, A does not provide consent for RM2 to report A's account. Under the presumption rules described in § 1.6049-5(d)(2)(i), RM2 is required to treat A as a U.S. non-exempt recipient. Despite this presumption rule, and because backup withholding does not apply under § 31.3406(g)-1(e), no information return shall be required with respect to the payment under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section if A is reported by RM2 consistent with § 1.1471-4(d)(6) as a non-consenting account holder. Additionally, RM2 may include A in the chapter 4 withholding rate pool of U.S. payees on the withholding statement provided to USP consistent with the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of this section.

(4) and (4)(i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.6049-4(f)(4) introductory text and (f)(4)(i).

(ii) *Example.* The application of the provisions of paragraph (f)(4) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.In January, 1984, Broker B, a U.S. payor, purchases on behalf of its customer, Individual A, an obligation issued by partnership RR in a public offering on that date. Broker B holds the obligation for A throughout 1984. Broker B is required to make an information return showing the amount of original issue discount treated as paid to A under § 1.6049-5(f).

(14) *Reporting Model 2 FFI.* The term *reporting Model 2 FFI* means a participating FFI that is described in § 1.1471-1(b)(91).

(15) *Withholdable payment.* The term *withholdable payment* means a payment described in § 1.1471-1(b)(145).

(16) *Paid and received outside the United States* - (i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (f)(16)(ii) and (iii) of this section, the term *paid and received outside the United States* means an amount that is paid by a payor or middleman outside the United States as described in § 1.6049-5(e).

(ii) *Transfers to the United States.* Without regard to the location of the account from which the amount is drawn, an amount that is described in paragraph (f)(16)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section and paid by transfer to an account maintained by the payee in the United States or by mail to a United States address (including an amount paid with respect to a bond or a discount obligation described in § 1.6049-5(e)(4)) is not considered to be paid and received outside the United States.

(A) An amount is described in this paragraph (f)(16)(ii)(A) if it is paid by an issuer or the paying agent of the issuer with respect to an obligation that is -

(*1*) Issued by a U.S. payor, as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(5);

(*2*) Registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a); or

(iv) *Examples.* The application of the provisions of paragraph (f)(16) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

Example 1.FC is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as defined in § 1.6049-5(c)(5). A holds FC coupon bonds that are not in registered form under section 163(f) and the regulations . FB, a foreign branch of DC, a domestic corporation, is the designated paying agent with respect to the bonds issued by FC. A does not have an account with FB. A presents a coupon to FB at its office outside the United States with instructions to transfer funds to a bank account maintained by A in the United States. FB transfers the funds in accordance with A's instructions. Even though the amount is credited to an account in the United States, the interest on the FC bonds is paid and received outside the United States under paragraph (f)(16)(ii) of this section and § 1.6049-5(e)(3) because the coupon is presented for payment outside the United States; because FC is a foreign person that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as defined in § 1.6049-5(d)(1); because FB is not acting as A's agent; and because the obligation is not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a), listed on a securities exchange that is registered as a national securities exchange in the United States, or included in an interdealer quotation system.Example 2.FC is a foreign corporation that is not a U.S. payor or U.S. middleman, as defined in § 1.6049-5(d)(1). B, a United States citizen, holds a bond issued by FC in registered form under section 163(f) and the regulations thereunder and registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77a). The bond is not a foreign-targeted registered obligation as defined in § 1.871-14(e)(2). DB, a United States branch of a foreign corporation engaged in the commercial banking business, is the registrar of the bonds issued by FC. DB supplies FC with a list of the holders of the FC bonds. Interest on the FC bonds is paid to B and other bondholders by checks prepared by FC at its principal office outside the United States, and B's check is mailed from there to his designated address in the United States. The bond is described in paragraph (f)(16)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section. The interest on the FC bonds paid to B by FC is not paid and received outside the United States under paragraph (f)(16) of this section.Example 3.The facts are the same as in *Example 2* except that the checks are prepared and mailed in the United States by DC, a U.S. corporation engaged in the commercial banking business that is the designated paying agent with respect to the bonds issued by FC, and B's check is mailed to his designated address outside the United States. For purposes of section 6049, the interest on the FC bonds paid by DC is not paid and received outside the United States under paragraph (f)(16)(i) of this section.

(g) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.6049-4(g).

(h) *Effective/applicability dates.* The provisions of paragraphs (c)(4), (f)(5) through (f)(16) of this section apply to payments made after June 30, 2014.

(i) *Expiration date.* The applicability of this section expires on February 28, 2017.
