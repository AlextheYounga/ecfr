##### § 1.6052-1 Information returns regarding payment of wages in the form of group-term life insurance. #####

(a) *Requirement of reporting*—(1) *In general.* Every employer, who during any calendar year provides any one of his employees remuneration for services in the form of group-term life insurance on the life of such employee any part of the cost of which is to be included in such employee's gross income as provided in section 79(a), shall make a separate return on Form W-2 with respect to each such employee for such year which includes the following information:

(i) Name, address, and identifying number of the employer;

(ii) Name, address, and social security number of the employee; and

(iii) Total amount includible in the employee's gross income by reason of the provisions of section 79(a), computed as if each employee reported his income on the basis of a calendar year (determined as if the employer making such return is the only employer paying the employee remuneration in the form of group-term life insurance on his life which is includible in his gross income under section 79(a)).

Returns on Form W-2 required to be filed pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be transmitted by Form W-3. In a case where, with respect to the same employee, an employer must make a return on Form W-2 under this section and also under § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations), or under § 1.6041-2 (relating to return of information as to payments to employees), such employer may make such returns on the same Form W-2 or on separate Forms W-2. In a case where an employer must file a Form W-3 under this section and also under § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5 of this chapter (Employment Tax Regulations), the Form W-3 filed under such § 31.6011(a)-4 or § 31.6011(a)-5 shall also be used as the transmittal form for a return on Form W-2 made pursuant to the provisions of this section.
