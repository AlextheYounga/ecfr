(1) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.6042-2(a)(1).

(i) Every person who makes a payment of dividends (as defined in § 1.6042-3) to any other person during a calendar year. The information return shall show the aggregate amount of the dividends, the name, address, and taxpayer identifying number of the person to whom paid, the amount of tax deducted and withheld under section 3406 from the dividends, if any, and such other information as required by the forms. An information return is generally not required if the amount of dividends paid to the other person during the calendar year aggregates less than $10 or if the payment is made to a person who is an exempt recipient described in § 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) unless the payor backup withholds under section 3406 on such payment (because, for example, the payee has failed to furnish a Form W-9), in which case the payor must make a return under this section, unless the payor refunds the amount withheld pursuant to § 31.6413(a)-3 of this chapter. Further, a return of information is not required under this section for -

(A) Payments with respect to which a return is not required by applying the rules of § 1.6049-4(c)(4) (by substituting the term *dividend* for the term *interest*); or

(B) Payments made by a paying agent on behalf of a corporation described in section 1297(a) with respect to a shareholder of the corporation if -

(*1*) The paying agent obtains from the corporation a written certification signed by an officer of the corporation, that states that the corporation is described in section 1297(a) for each calendar year during which the paying agent relies on the provisions of paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this section, and the paying agent has no reason to know the written certification is unreliable or incorrect;

(*2*) The paying agent identifies, prior to payment, the corporation as a participating FFI (including a reporting Model 2 FFI) (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(10) or (14), respectively), or reporting Model 1 FFI (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(13)), in accordance with the requirements of § 1.1471-3(d)(4) (substituting the terms *paying agent* and *corporation* for the terms *withholding agent* and *payee*);

(*3*) The paying agent obtains, before each year the payment would otherwise be reported, a written certification representing that the corporation shall report the payment as part of its reporting obligations under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)) with respect to its U.S. accounts and provided the paying agent does not know that the corporation is not reporting the payment as required. A paying agent that knows that the corporation is not reporting the payment as required under chapter 4 of the Code or an applicable IGA (as defined in § 1.6049-4(f)(7)) must report all payments reportable under this section that it makes during the year in which it obtains such knowledge; and

(*4*) The paying agent is not also acting in its capacity as a custodian, nominee, or other agent of the payee with respect to the payments.

(ii) through (e) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.6042-2(a)(1)(ii) through (e).

(f) *Effective/applicability date.* The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1)(i) of this section apply to payments made after June 30, 2014.

(g) *Expiration date.* The applicability of this section expires on February 28, 2017.
