(a) *In general.* Section 821(f) provides a special reduction in the statutory underwriting income (as defined by section 823(a)(1) and paragraph (b)(1) of § 1.823-6) of any company taxable under section 821(a) which was taxable under section 821 for the five taxable years immediately preceding January 1, 1962, and which incurred an underwriting loss (as defined in section 821(f)(3) and paragraph (c) of this section) for each of such five taxable years.

(b) *Amount of reduction.* In the case of a company described in section 821(f)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section the statutory underwriting income for the taxable year (determined without regard to this paragraph) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount by which:

(1) The sum of the underwriting losses of such company for the five taxable years immediately preceding January 1, 1962, exceeds

(2) The total amount by which the company's statutory underwriting income was reduced by reason of section 821(f) and this section for prior taxable years.

(c) *Underwriting loss defined.* For purposes of computing the amount of the reduction available under section 821(f) and paragraph (a) of this section, the term underwriting loss means statutory underwriting loss (as defined by section 823(a)(2) and paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.823-6) computed without any deduction under section 824(a) and paragraph (a) of § 1.824-1 (relating to deduction to provide protection against losses) and without any deduction under section 832(c)(11) (relating to dividends and similar distributions paid or declared to policyholders). For rules relating to the definition of dividends and similar distributions paid or declared to policyholders, see paragraph (a) of § 1.832-5.
