##### § 1.411(a)-3 Vesting in employer-derived benefits. #####

(a) *In general*—(1) *Alternative requirements.* A plan is not a qualified plan (and a trust forming a part of such plan is not a qualified trust) unless the plan satisfies the requirements of section 411(a)(2) and this section. A plan satisfies the requirements of this section if is satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section.

(2) *Composite arrangements.* A plan will not be considered to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section unless it satisfies all requirements of a particular one of such paragraphs with respect to all of an employee's years of service. A plan which, for example, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b) (but not (c) or (d)) for an employee's first 9 years of service and satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) (but not (b)) for all of his remaining years of service, does not satisfy the requirements of this section. A plan is not precluded from satisfying the requirement of one such paragraph with respect to one group of employees and another such paragraph with respect to another group provided that the groups are not so structured as to evade the requirements of this paragraph. For example, if plan A provides that employees who commence participation before age 30 are subject to the “rule of 45” vesting schedule and employees who commence participation after age 30 are subject to the full vesting after 10 years schedule, plan A would be so structured as to evade the requirements of this paragraph.

(3) *Plan amendments.* A plan which satisfies the requirements of a particular one of such paragraphs for each of an employee's years of service and which is amended so that, as amended, it satisfies the requirements of another such paragraph for all such years of service, satisfies the requirements of this section even though, as amended, it does not satisfy the requirements of the paragraph which were satisfied prior to the amendment. See § 1.411(a)-8 for rules relating to employee election where the vesting schedule is amended.

(b) *10-year vesting.* A plan satisfies the requirements of section 411(a)(2) (A) and this paragraph if an employee who has completed 10 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of his accrued benefit derived from employer contributions.

(c) *5- to 15-year vesting.* A plan satisfies the requirements of section 411(a)(2) (B) and this paragraph if an employee who has completed at least 5 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to a percentage of his accrued benefit derived from employer contribution which percentage is not less than the nonforfeitable percentage determined under the following table:

|Completed years of service|Nonforfeitable percentage|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|            5             |           25            |
|            6             |           30            |
|            7             |           35            |
|            8             |           40            |
|            9             |           45            |
|            10            |           50            |
|            11            |           60            |
|            12            |           70            |
|            13            |           80            |
|            14            |           90            |
|        15 or more        |           100           |

(d) *Rule of 45.* A plan satisfies the requirements of section 411(a)(2)(C) and this paragraph if an employee is entitled to the greater of the two percentages determined under paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section.

(1) *Age and service test.* An employee who is not separated from the service, who has completed at least 5 years of service, and with respect to whom the sum of his age and years of service equals of exceeds 45, has a nonforfeit- able right to a percentage of his accrued benefit derived from employer contributions which is not less than the nonforfeitable percentage corresponding to his number of completed years of service to the sum of his age and completed years of service (whichever percentage is the lesser) determined under the following table:

|Completed years of service|Sum of age and service|Nonforfeitable percentage|
|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
|            5             |       45 or 46       |           50            |
|            6             |       47 or 48       |           60            |
|            7             |       49 or 50       |           70            |
|            8             |       51 or 52       |           80            |
|            9             |       53 or 54       |           90            |
|        10 or more        |      55 or more      |           100           |

(2) *Service test.* An employee who has completed at least 10 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to a percentage of his accrued benefit derived from employer contributions determined under the following table:

|Completed years of service|Nonforfeitable percentage|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|            10            |           50            |
|            11            |           60            |
|            12            |           70            |
|            13            |           80            |
|            14            |           90            |
|            15            |           100           |

(3) *Computation of age.* For purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the age of an employee is his age on his last birthday.

(e) *Examples.* The rules provided by this section are illustrated by the following examples:

Example 1.Plan B provides that each employee's rights to his employer-derived accrued benefit are nonforfeitable as follows:

|Completed years of service|Nonforfeitable percentage|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|        2 or less         |            0            |
|            3             |           30            |
|            4             |           35            |
|            5             |           40            |
|            6             |           45            |
|            7             |           50            |
|            8             |           55            |
|            9             |           60            |
|            10            |           65            |
|            11            |           70            |
|            12            |           75            |
|            13            |           80            |
|            14            |           85            |
|            15            |           100           |

Plan B does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section (relating to 5-15-year vesting) because the nonforfeitable percentage provided by the plan after completion of 14 years of service (85 percent) is less than the percentage required by paragraph (c) of this section at that time (90 percent). The fact that the nonforfeitable percentage provided by the plan for years prior to the 13th year of service is greater than the percentage required under paragraph (c) of this section is immaterial. The plan fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section even if it is demonstrated that the value of the vesting provided by the plan to the employee is at least equal to the value of the vesting rate required by that paragraph.Example 2.Plan C provides for plan participation after the completion of 1 year of service. The plan provides that each employee's rights to his employer-derived accrued benefit are 100 percent nonforfeitable after 10 years of plan participation rather than service. The plan does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section because, under the plan, an employee obtains a 100 percent nonforfeitable right to his employer-derived accrued benefit only after completion of more than 10 years of service.Example 3.Plan D provides that each employee's rights to his employer-derived accrued benefit are nonforfeitable in accordance with the following schedule:

|Completed years of service|Nonforfeitable percentage|
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
|           0-9            |            0            |
|            10            |           50            |
|            11            |           60            |
|            12            |           70            |
|            13            |           80            |
|            14            |           90            |
|            15            |           100           |

The plan does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section after the 9th year of service. It does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section for years prior to the 10th year of service. It does not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of this section for any year of service prior to the 10th year. The plan does not satisfy the requirements of this section because it does not satisfy the requirements of a particular one of the three paragraphs for each of an employee's years of service.Example 4.Plan G provides that each employee's rights to his employer-derived accrued benefit are 100 percent nonforfeitable upon completion of 5 years of service. The plan satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section and, because it satisfies the requirements of at least one of such paragraphs for all of an employee's years of service, it satisfies the requirements of this section.(Sec. 411 (88 Stat. 901; 26 U.S.C. 411))[T.D. 7501, 42 FR 42325, Aug. 23, 1977]
