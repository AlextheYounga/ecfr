##### § 1.501(c)(3)-1T Organizations organized and operated for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for public safety, literary, or educational purposes, or for the prevention of cruelty to children or animals (temporary). #####

(a) through (b)(1)(iv) [Reserved] For further guidance see § 1.501(c)(3)-1(a) through (b)(1)(iv).

(v) Unless otherwise prescribed by applicable regulations or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin, an organization must, in order to establish its exemption, submit a detailed statement of its proposed activities with and as a part of its application for exemption (see paragraph (b) of § 1.501(a)-1).

(b)(2) through (b)(5) [Reserved] For further guidance see § 1.501(c)(3)-1(b)(2) through (b)(5).

(6) *Applicability of the organizational test.* A determination by the Commissioner that an organization is described in section 501(c)(3) and exempt under section 501(a) will not be granted after July 26, 1959, regardless of when the application is filed, unless such organization meets the organizational test prescribed by this paragraph (b)(6). If, before July 27, 1959, an organization has been determined by the Commissioner or district director to be exempt as an organization described in section 501(c)(3) or in a corresponding provision of prior law and such determination has not been revoked before such date, the fact that such organization does not meet the organizational test prescribed by this paragraph (b)(6) shall not be a basis for revoking such determination. Accordingly, an organization that has been determined to be exempt before July 27, 1959, and which does not seek a new determination of exemption is not required to amend its articles of organization to conform to the rules of this paragraph (b)(6), but any organization that seeks a determination of exemption after July 26, 1959, must have articles of organization that meet the rules of this paragraph (b)(6). For the rules relating to whether an organization determined to be exempt before July 27, 1959, is organized exclusively for one or more exempt purposes, see 26 CFR (1939) 39.101(6)-1 (Regulations 118) as made applicable to the Code by Treasury Decision 6091, approved August 16, 1954 (19 FR 5167; CB 1954-2, 47).

(c) through (g) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.501(c)(3)-1(c) through (g).

(h) *Effective/applicability date.* (1) Paragraphs (b)(1)(v) and (b)(6) of this section apply on and after July 1, 2014.

(2) *Expiration date.* Paragraphs (b)(1)(v) and (b)(6) of this section expire on or before June 30, 2017.
