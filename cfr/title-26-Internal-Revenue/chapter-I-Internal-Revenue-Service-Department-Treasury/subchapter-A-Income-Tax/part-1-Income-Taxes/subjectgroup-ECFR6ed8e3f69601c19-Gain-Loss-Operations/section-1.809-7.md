##### ยง 1.809-7 Limitation on certain deductions. #####

(a) *In general.* Section 809(f)(1) limits the deductions under section 809(d) (3), (5), and (6), relating to deductions for dividends to policyholders, certain nonparticipating contracts, and group life, accident, and health insurance contracts, respectively. This limitation provides that the amount of such deductions shall not exceed the sum of (1) the amount (if any) by which the gain from operations for the taxable year (determined without regard to such deductions) exceeds the taxpayer's taxable investment income for such year, plus (2) $250,000.

(b) *Application of limitation.* Section 809(f)(2) provides a priority system for applying the limitation contained in section 809(f)(1) and paragraph (a) of this section. Under this priortity system, the limitation shall be applied in the following order:

(1) For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962:

(i) First to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(6) (relating to group life, accident, and health insurance);

(ii) Then to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(5) (relating to certain nonparticipating contracts); and

(iii) Finally to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(3) (relating to dividends to policyholders).

(2) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the limitation shall be applied in the following order:

(i) First to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(3);

(ii) Then to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(6); and

(iii) Finally to the amount of the deduction under section 809(d)(5).

Thus, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1961, the limitation and priority system would operate first to disallow a deduction under section 809(d)(5), then a deduction under section 809(d)(6), and finally a deduction under section 809(d)(3). For purposes of applying the 50 percent limitation contained in section 809(d)(6) with respect to a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1961, the amount of the deductions for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1962, shall be determined by applying the priortity system contained in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph.

(c) *Illustration of principles.* The operation of the limitation and priority system provided by section 809(f) and this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

Example 1.Assume the following facts with respect to M, a life insurance company, for the taxable year 1958:

|Gain from operations computed without regard to the deductions under sec. 809(d) (3), (5), and (6)|$100,000,000|
|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------:|
|                                    Taxable investment income                                     | 83,000,000 |
|     Tentative deduction for group life, accident, and health insurance under sec. 809(d)(6)      | 4,000,000  |
|         Tentative deduction for certain nonparticipating contracts under sec. 809(d)(5)          | 6,000,000  |
|             Tentative deduction for dividends to policyholders under sec. 809(d)(3)              | 10,000,000 |

In order to determine the limitation on the deductions under section 809(d) (3), (5), and (6), M would make up the following schedule:

|                                                                                              (1) Statutory amount provided under sec. 809(f)(1)                                                                                              |  $250,000  |   |

|                                                                                                        (3) Taxable investment income                                                                                                         | 83,000,000 |   |
|                                                                                                     (4) Excess of item (2) over item (3)                                                                                                     | 17,000,000 |   |
|                                                                          (5) Limitation on deductions under sec. 809(d) (3), (5), and (6) (item (1) plus item (4))                                                                           | 17,250,000 |   |
|Since the total tentative deductions under section 809(d) (3), (5), and (6) ($20,000,000) exceeds the limitation on such deductions ($17,250,000), M would make up the following schedule to determine the application of the priority system:|            |   |

|                                                                (7) Deduction for group life, accident, and health insurance under sec. 809(d)(6) (not in excess of item (6))                                                                 | 4,000,000  |   |

|                                                                    (9) Deduction for certain nonparticipating contracts under sec. 809(d)(5) (not in excess of item (8))                                                                     | 6,000,000  |   |
|                                                                                (10) Maximum possible deduction under sec. 809(d)(3) (item (8) less item (9))                                                                                 | 7,250,000  |   |
|                                                                       (11) Deduction for dividends to policyholders under sec. 809(d)(3) (not in excess of item (10))                                                                        | 7,250,000  |   |

Thus, as a result of the application of the limitation and priority system for the taxable year 1958, M shall be allowed a deduction of $4,000,000 under section 809(d)(6), $6,000,000 under section 809(d)(5), and only $7,250,000 of the $10,000,000 tentative deduction under section 809(d)(3).Example 2.The facts are the same as in example 1, except that the taxable year is 1962. Since the total tentative deductions under section 809(d) (3), (5), and (6) ($20,000,000) exceeds the limitation on such deductions ($17,250,000), M would make up the following schedule to determine the application of the priority system:

|             (1) Maximum possible deductions under sec. 809(d) (3), (5), and (6) (item (5) in example 1)             |$17,250,000|
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------:|
|            (2) Deduction for dividends to policyholders under sec. 809(d)(3) (not in excess of item (1))            |10,000,000 |
|                    (3) Maximum possible deduction under sec. 809(d)(6) (item (1) less item (2))                     | 7,250,000 |
|(4) Deduction for certain accident, health, and group life insurance under sec. 809(d)(6) (not in excess of item (3))| 4,000,000 |
|                    (5) Maximum possible deduction under sec. 809(d)(5) (item (4) less item (5))                     | 3,250,000 |
|        (6) Deduction for certain nonparticipating contracts under sec. 809(d)(5) (not in excess of item (5))        | 3,250,000 |

Thus, as a result of the application of the limitation and priority system for the taxable year 1962, M shall be allowed a deduction of $10,000,000 under section 809(d)(3), $4,000,000 under section 809(d)(6), and only $3,250,000 of the $6,000,000 tentative deduction under section 809(d)(5).[T.D. 6535, 26 FR 530, Jan. 20, 1961, as amended by T.D. 6886, 31 FR 8688, June 23, 1966]
