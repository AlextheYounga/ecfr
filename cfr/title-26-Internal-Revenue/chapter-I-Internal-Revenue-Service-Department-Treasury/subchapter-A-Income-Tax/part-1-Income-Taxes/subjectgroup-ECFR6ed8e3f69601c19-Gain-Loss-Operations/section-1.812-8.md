##### ยง 1.812-8 Illustration of operations loss carrybacks and carryovers. #####

The application of ยง 1.812-4 may be illustrated by the following example:

(a) *Facts.* The books of M, a life insurance company, organized in 1940, reveal the following facts:

|Taxable year|Taxable investment income|Gain from operations|Loss from operations|
|------------|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
|    1958    |         $11,000         |      $15,000       |                    |

The gain from operations thus shown is computed without regard to any operations loss deduction. The assumption is also made that none of the other modifications prescribed in paragraph (b) of ยง 1.812-5 apply. There are no losses from operations for 1955, 1956, 1957, 1968, 1969, 1970.

(b) *Loss sustained in 1960.* The portions of the $75,000 loss from operations for 1960 which shall be used as carrybacks to 1958 and 1959 and as carryovers to 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, and 1965 are computed as follows:

(1) *Carryback to 1958.* The carryback to this year is $75,000, that is, the amount of the loss from operations.

(2) *Carryback to 1959.* The carryback to this year is $60,000 (the excess of the loss for 1960 over the offset for 1958), computed as follows:
