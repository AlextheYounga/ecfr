##### § 1.863-3A Income from the sale of personal property derived partly from within and partly from without the United States. #####

(a) *General*—(1) *Classes of income.* Income from the sale of property to which paragraph (b)(2) and (3) of § 1.863-2 applies is divided into two classes for purposes of this section, namely, income which is treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a foreign country, and income which is treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a possession of the United States.

(2) *Definition.* For purposes of this section, the word “produced” includes created, fabricated, manufactured, extracted, processed, cured, or aged. For determining the time and place of sale of personal property for purposes of this section, see paragraph (c) of § 1.861-7.

(b) *Income partly from sources within a foreign country*—(1) *General.* This paragraph relates to gains, profits, and income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a foreign country, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a foreign country and sold within the United States. Pursuant to section 863(b) such items shall be treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a foreign country.

(2) *Allocation or apportionment.* The taxable income from sources within the United States, in the case of the items to which this paragraph applies, shall be determined according to the examples set forth in this subparagraph. For such purposes, the deductions for the personal exemptions shall not be taken into account, but the special deductions described in paragraph (c) of § 1.861-8 shall be taken into account.

Example 1.Where the manufacturer or producer regularly sells part of his output to wholly independent distributors or other selling concerns in such a way as to establish fairly an independent factory or production price—or shows to the satisfaction of the district director (or, if applicable, the Director of International Operations) that such an independent factory or production price has been otherwise established—unaffected by considerations of tax liability and the selling or distributing branch or department of the business is located in a different country from that in which the factory is located or the production carried on, the taxable income attributable to sources within the United States shall be computed by an accounting which treats the products as sold by the factory or productive department of the business to the distributing or selling department at the independent factory price so established. In all such cases the basis of the accounting shall be fully explained in a statement attached to the return for the taxable year.Example 2.(i)-(ii) [Reserved]. For guidance, see § 863-3T(b)(2) *Example* (2)(i) and (ii).

(iii) The term “gross sales”, as used in this example, refers only to the sales of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a foreign country or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a foreign country and sold within the United States.

(iv) The term “property”, as used in this example, includes only the property held or used to produce income which is derived from such sales. Such property should be taken at its actual value, which in the case of property valued or appraised for purposes of inventory, depreciation, depletion, or other purposes of taxation shall be the highest amount at which so valued or appraised, and which in other cases shall be deemed to be its book value in the absence of affirmative evidence showing such value to be greater or less than the actual value. The average value during the taxable year or period shall be employed. The average value of property as above prescribed at the beginning and end of the taxable year or period ordinarily may be used, unless by reason of material changes during the taxable year or period such average does not fairly represent the average for such year or period, in which event the average shall be determined upon a monthly or daily basis.

(v) Bills and accounts receivable shall (unless satisfactory reason for a different treatment is shown) be assigned or allocated to the United States when the debtor resides in the United States, unless the taxpayer has no office, branch, or agent in the United States.

Example 3.Application for permission to base the return upon the taxpayer's books of account will be considered by the district director (or, if applicable, the Director of International Operations) in the case of any taxpayer who, in good faith and unaffected by considerations of tax liability, regularly employs in his books of account a detailed allocation of receipts and expenditures which reflects more clearly than the processes or formulas herein prescribed the taxable income derived from sources within the United States.

(c) *Income partly from sources within a possession of the United States*—(1) *General.* This paragraph relates to gains, profits, and income which, pursuant to section 863(b), are treated as derived partly from sources within the United States and partly from sources within a possession of the United States. The items so treated are described in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph.

(2) *Allocation or apportionment.* The taxable income from sources within the United States, in the case of the items to which this paragraph applies, shall be determined according to the examples set forth in subparagraphs (3) and (4) of this paragraph. For such purposes, the deductions for the personal exemptions shall not be taken into account, but the special deductions described in paragraph (c) of § 1.861-8 shall be taken into account.

(3) *Personal property produced and sold.* This subparagraph relates to gross income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a possession of the United States, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a possession of the United States and sold within the United States.

Example 1.Same as example 1 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.Example 2.(i) Where an independent factory or production price has not been established as provided under example 1, the taxable income shall first be computed by deducting from the gross income derived from the sale of personal property produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within the United States and sold within a possession of the United States, or produced (in whole or in part) by the taxpayer within a possession of the United States and sold within the United States, the expenses, losses, or other deductions properly allocated and apportioned thereto in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.861-8.

(ii) Of the amount of taxable income so determined, one-half shall be apportioned in accordance with the value of the taxpayer's property within the United States and within the possession of the United States, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being determined by multiplying such one-half by a fraction the numerator of which consists of the value of the taxpayer's property within the United States, and the denominator of which consists of the value of the taxpayer's property both within the United States and within the possession of the United States. The remaining one-half of such taxable income shall be apportioned in accordance with the total business of the taxpayer within the United States and within the possession of the United States, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being determined by multiplying such one-half by a fraction the numerator of which consists of the amount of the taxpayer's business for the taxable year or period within the United States, and the denominator of which consists of the amount of the taxpayer's business for the taxable year or period both within the United States and within the possession of the United States.

(iii) “The business of the taxpayer”, as used in this example, shall be measured by the amounts which the taxpayer paid out during the taxable year or period for wages, salaries, and other compensation of employees and for the purchase of goods, materials, and supplies consumed in the regular course of business, plus the amounts received during the taxable year or period from gross sales, such expenses, purchases, and gross sales being limited to those attributable to the production (in whole or in part) of personal property within the United States and its sale within a possession of the United States or to the production (in whole or in part) of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States. The term “property”, as used in this example, includes only the property held or used to produce income which is derived from such sales.

Example 3.Same as example 3 under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(4) *Personal property purchased and sold.* This subparagraph relates to gross income derived from the purchase of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States.

Example 1.(i) The taxable income shall first be computed by deducting from such gross income the expenses, losses, or other deductions properly allocated or apportioned thereto in accordance with the rules set forth in § 1.861-8.

(ii) The amount of taxable income so determined shall be apportioned in accordance with the total business of the taxpayer within the United States and within the possession of the United States, the portion attributable to sources within the United States being that percentage of such taxable income which the amount of the taxpayer's business for the taxable year or period within the United States bears to the amount of the taxpayer's business for the taxable year or period both within the United States and within the possession of the United States.

(iii) The “business of the taxpayer”, as that term is used in this example, shall be measured by the amounts which the taxpayer paid out during the taxable year or period for wages, salaries, and other compensation of employees and for the purchase of goods, materials, and supplies sold or consumed in the regular course of business, plus the amount received during the taxable year or period from gross sales, such expenses, purchases, and gross sales being limited to those attributable to the purchase of personal property within a possession of the United States and its sale within the United States.
