##### § 1.50B-1 Definitions of WIN expenses and WIN employees. #####

(a) *WIN expenses*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, for purposes of §§ 1.50A-1 through 1.50B-5, the term “work incentive program expenses” (referred to in §§ 1.50A-1 through 1.50B-5 as “WIN expenses”) means the salaries and wages paid or incurred by the taxpayer for services rendered during the first 12 months of employment (whether or not consecutive) by an employee who is certified by the Secretary of Labor as—

(i) Having been placed in employment by the taxpayer (or if the taxpayer is a partner of a partnership, beneficiary of an estate or trust, or a shareholder of an electing small business corporation, by such partnership, estate, trust, or electing small business corporation) under a work incentive (WIN) program established under section 432(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 632(b)(1)), and

(ii) Not having displaced any individual from employment.

The term “WIN expenses” includes only salaries and wages paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1971. See paragraph (c) of § 1.50A-3 for rules relating to the determination of the first 12 months of employment (whether or not consecutive).

(2) *Examples.* The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:

Example 1.X Corporation, an accrual basis taxpayer which files its return on the basis of the calendar year, hired an employee on July 1, 1971, who was certified by the Secretary of Labor under this paragraph. The first 12 months of employment were continuous. X is entitled to the credit provided by section 40 with respect to the salaries or wages incurred during its taxable year beginning January 1, 1972, for services rendered by that employee during the period beginning July 1, 1971, and ending June 30, 1972.Example 2.Y, a cash basis taxpayer who files his return on the basis of the calendar year, employed A, an employee certified by the Secretary of Labor under this paragraph, on July 1, 1971. A's first 12 months of employment were continuous. Y paid A on the basis of a semimonthly payroll period, but paid his payroll 2 days after the close of the payroll period during which the wages were earned. Thus, Y paid A on January 2, 1972, for services rendered between December 16, 1971, and December 31, 1971. Y is entitled to the credit provided by section 40 with respect to the wages paid for services rendered by A during the period beginning December 16, 1971, and ending June 30, 1972, because those wages were paid by Y in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1971.

(b) *Salaries and wages.* For purposes of this section, the term “salaries and wages” means only cash remuneration including a check. Amounts deducted and withheld from the employee's pay (for example, taxes and contributions to health and retirement plans) shall be deemed to be cash remuneration even though not actually paid directly to the employee.

(c) *Trade or business expenses.* The term “WIN expenses” includes only salaries and wages which are paid or incurred in a trade or business of the taxpayer and which are deductible in computing taxable income. Thus, salaries and wages paid to domestic employees in a private home are not “WIN expenses”.

(d) *Reimbursed expenses*—(1) *In general.* The term “WIN expenses” does not include salaries and wages to the extent that the taxpayer is reimbursed for such salaries or wages from any source.

(2) *Example.* Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.X Company, which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, hired WIN employees on January 1, 1972. X Company has a cost-plus construction contract with the Federal Government. The fact that X has a construction contract with the Federal Government or anyone else does not change its character from a normal business transaction in which there has been a sale of materials and services. Thus, the salaries or wages paid or incurred for services rendered by these WIN employees would not be reimbursed expenses, and X would be entitled to the credit provided by section 40.

(e) *Geographical limitation*—(1) *In general.* The term “WIN expenses” does not include salaries and wages paid or incurred for services rendered outside the United States (as defined in sections 638 (relating to Continental Shelf areas) and 7701(a)(9). However, services rendered by any WIN employee outside the United States (as defined in sections 638 (relating to Continental Shelf areas) and 7701(a)(9)) shall contribute to such employee's first 12 months of employment (whether or not consecutive) for purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 and paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) *Example.* Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.X Corporation, which files its return on the basis of the calendar year, hired A, a WIN employee, on January 1, 1972, and continuously employed him for the following 24-month period. During January and February of 1972, X paid A's wages while he received training conducted in Puerto Rico. For the remainder of the calendar year A performed services for X within the United States. For purposes of paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3 and paragraph (a) of this section, A's first 12 months of employment are January 1, 1972, to December 31, 1972. Under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph no wages paid to A for services rendered during the months of January and February of 1972 may be taken into account by X under paragraph (a) of this section as WIN expenses because the services were rendered outside the United States. However, X may take into account wages he has incurred with respect to A for the period March 1, 1972, to December 31, 1972.

(f) *Maximum period of training or instruction.* The term “WIN expenses” does not include salaries and wages paid or incurred for services rendered by a WIN employee after the end of the 24-month period beginning with the date of initial employment (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.50A-3) of the WIN employee.

(g) *Ineligible individuals.* The term “WIN expenses” does not include salaries and wages paid or incurred for services rendered by a WIN employee who—

(1) Bears any of the relationships described in paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 152(a) of the Code to the taxpayer, or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, to an individual who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent in value of the outstanding stock of the corporation (determined with the application of section 267(c) of the Code),

(2) If the taxpayer is an estate or trust, is a grantor, beneficiary, or fiduciary of the estate or trust, or is an individual who bears any of the relationships described in paragraphs (1) through (8) of section 152(a) of the Code to a grantor, beneficiary, or fiduciary of the estate or trust, or

(3) Is a dependent (described in section 152(a)(9) of the Code) of the taxpayer, or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, of an individual described in subparagraph (1), or, if the taxpayer is an estate or trust, of a grantor, beneficiary, or fiduciary of the estate or trust.

(h) *WIN employee.* For purposes of §§ 1.50A-1 through 1.50B-5 the term “WIN employee” means an employee who is certified by the Secretary of Labor as meeting the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section.

(i) [Reserved]

(j) *Special rule applicable to transactions to which section 381(a) applies and transactions involving a mere change in form of conducting a trade or business.* The first 12 months of employment (whether or not consecutive) and the period described in section 50B (c)(4) of any WIN employee, for purposes of determining the amount of WIN expenses (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-1), shall not be affected by transactions to which the rule contained in paragraph (f) (relating to transaction to which section 381(a) (relating to certain corporate acquisitions) applies), or paragraph (g) (relating to a mere change in form of conducting a trade or business) of § 1.50A-4 applies.
