##### § 1.50B-4 Partnerships. #####

(a) *General rule*—(1) *In general.* In the case of a partnership, each partner shall take into account separately, for his taxable year with or within which the partnership taxable year ends, his share (as determined under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph) of the WIN expenses (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-1) of employees employed by the partnership during such partnership's taxable year. The WIN expenses for each employee shall be allocated separately.

(2) *Partner as taxpayer.* Each partner shall be treated as the taxpayer who paid or incurred the share of the WIN expenses allocated to him. If a partner takes into account in determining his WIN expenses the WIN expenses of an employee of a partnership, and if the employment of such employee is terminated in a termination subject to the rules contained in paragraph (a) of § 1.50A-3, or if the partnership fails to pay comparable wages and such failure is subject to the rules contained in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of § 1.50A-3, then such partner shall make a recapture determination under the provisions of section 50A (c) and (d) of the Code and § 1.50A-3. See § 1.50A-7.

(3) *Determination of partner's share.* (i) Each partner's share of the WIN expenses shall be determined in accordance with the ratio in which the partners divide the general profits of the partnership (that is, the taxable income of the partnership as described in section 702 (a)(9)) regardless of whether the partnership has a profit or a loss for the taxable year during which the WIN expenses are paid or incurred. However, if the ratio in which the partners divide the general profits of the partnership changes during the taxable year of the partnership, the ratio effective for the date on which the WIN expenses are paid or incurred shall apply.

(ii) Notwithstanding subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, if the deduction with respect to any WIN expenses is specially allocated and if such special allocation is recognized under section 704 (a) and (b) and paragraph (b) of § 1.704-1, then each partner's share of the WIN expenses shall be determined by reference to such special allocation effective for the date on which the WIN expenses are paid or incurred.

(4) *Computation of the first 12 months of employment.* The first 12 months of employment (whether or not consecutive) and the period described in section 50B(c)(4) with respect to any WIN employee for purposes of determining the amount of WIN expenses (as defined in paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-1) shall not be affected by a change in the partners of such partnership and shall not be affected by a change in the ratio in which the partners divide the general profits of the partnership. Thus, the first 12 months of employment (whether or not consecutive) and the 24-month period described in section 50B(c)(4) of any WIN employee shall be the same with respect to any partner claiming a credit under section 40 for salaries and wages paid or incurred for services rendered by such employee.

(b) *Summary statement.* A partnership shall attach to its return a statement showing the allocation to each partner of its WIN expenses with respect to each WIN employee.

(c) *Examples.* Paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

Example 1.Partnership ABCD hires a WIN employee on January 1, 1972, and hires a second WIN employee on September 1, 1972. The ABCD partnership and each of its partners reports income on the basis of the calendar year. Partners A, B, C, and D share partnership profits equally. Each partner's share of the WIN expenses incurred with respect to these employees is 25 percent.Example 2.Assume the same facts as in example 1 and the following additional facts: A dies on June 30, 1972, and B purchases A's interest as of such date. Each partner's share of the profits from January 1 to June 30 is 25 percent. From July 1 to December 31, B's share of the profits is 50 percent, and C and D's share of the profits is 25 percent each. B shall take into account 25 percent of the WIN expenses incurred during the period beginning January 1 and ending June 30 and 50 percent of the WIN expenses incurred during the remainder of the year with respect to the employee hired on January 1, 1972. Also, B shall take into account 50 percent of the WIN expenses incurred with respect to the employee hired on September 1, C and D shall each take into account 25 percent of the WIN expenses incurred with respect to the employees employed by the partnership in 1972. Under paragraph (a)(3), for purposes of determining the period of employment that may be taken into account by B, the initial date of employment of the WIN employee hired on January 1 relates back to the date he was first employed, *i.e.,* January 1, 1972.Example 3.Partnership SH is engaged in manufacturing. Under the terms of the partnership agreements deductions attributable to the employment of WIN employees are specially allocated 70 percent to partner S and 30 percent to partner H. In all other respects S and H share profits and losses equally. If the special allocation with respect to the WIN expenses is recognized under section 704 (a) and (b) and paragraph (b) of § 1.704-1, the WIN expenses shall be taken into account, 70 percent by S and 30 percent by H.Example 4.(i) LMN partnership, which files its return on the basis of the calendar year, hires five WIN employees in 1973. The WIN expenses incurred with respect to each employee are as follows:

|WIN employee No.|WIN expenses|
|----------------|------------|
|       1        |   $6,000   |
|       2        |   5,000    |
|       3        |   4,000    |
|       4        |   4,000    |
|       5        |   3,000    |
|     Total      |   22,000   |

On December 31, 1973, the ratio in which the partners divide the general profits of the LMN partnership is as follows: L receives three-tenths of the general profits, M receives two-tenths of the general profits, and N receives five-tenths of the general profits.(ii) Under this section the WIN expenses are apportioned to the partners of LMN partnership as follows:

|  WIN employees   |  1   |  2   |  3   |  4   |  5   | Total |
|------------------|------|------|------|------|------|-------|
|Total WIN expenses|$6,000|$5,000|$4,000|$4,000|$3,000|$22,000|
| Partner L (3/10) |1,800 |1,500 |1,200 |1,200 | 900  | 6,600 |
| Partner M (2/10) |1,200 |1,000 | 800  | 800  | 600  | 4,400 |
| Partner N (5/10) |3,000 |2,500 |2,000 |2,000 |1,500 |11,000 |

Assume that partners L, M, and N did not directly incur any other WIN expenses during their taxable year in which falls December 31, 1973 (the last day of LMN partnership's taxable year) and that such partners did not own any interest in other partnerships, electing small business corporations, estates, or trusts that incurred WIN expenses. The total WIN expenses of partner L are $6,600, of partner M are $4,400, and of partner N are $11,000.[38 FR 6164, Mar. 7, 1973]
