##### § 1.50B-5 Limitations with respect to certain persons. #####

(a) *Mutual savings institutions.* In the case of an organization to which section 593 applies (that is, a mutual savings bank, a cooperative bank, or a domestic building and loan association)—

(1) WIN expenses shall be 50 percent of the amount otherwise determined under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-1, and

(2) The $25,000 amount specified in section 50A(a)(2), relating to limitation based on amount of tax, shall be reduced by 50 percent of such amount.

For example, a domestic building and loan association incurs $30,000 in WIN expenses (as determined under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-1) during its taxable year. However, under this paragraph such amount is reduced to $15,000 (50 percent of $30,000). If an organization to which section 593 applies is a member of a controlled group (as defined in section 50A(a)(5)), the $25,000 amount specified in section 50A(a)(2) shall be reduced in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of § 1.50A-1 before such amount is further reduced under this paragraph.

(b) *Regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts.* (1) In the case of a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust subject to taxation under subchapter M, chapter 1 of the Code—

(i) The WIN expenses determined under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-1, and

(ii) The $25,000 amount specified in section 50A(a)(2), relating to limitation based on amount of tax,

shall be reduced to such person's ratable share of each such amount. If a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust is a member of a controlled group (as defined in section 50A (a)(5)), the $25,000 amount specified in section 50A(a)(2) shall be reduced in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of § 1.50A-1 before such amount is further reduced under this paragraph.

(2) A person's ratable share of the amount described in subparagraph (1)(i) and the amount described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph shall be the ratio which—

(i) Taxable income for the taxable year, bears to,

(ii) Taxable income for the taxable year plus the amount of the deduction for dividends paid taken into account under section 852(b)(2)(D) in computing investment company taxable income, or under section 857(b)(2)(B) (section 857(b)(2)(C), as then in effect, for taxable years ending before October 5, 1976) in computing real estate investment trust taxable income, as the case may be.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term “taxable income” means, in the case of a regulated investment company, its investment company taxable income (within the meaning of section 852(b)(2)) and, in the case of a real estate investment trust its real estate investment trust, taxable income (within the meaning of section 857(b)(2)). In the case of a taxable year ending after October 4, 1976, real estate investment trust taxable income, for purposes of this paragraph, is determined by excluding any net capital gain, and by computing the deduction for dividends paid without regard to capital gains dividends (as defined in section 857(b)(3)(C)). The amount of the deduction for dividends paid includes the amount of deficiency dividends (other than capital gains deficiency dividends) taken into account in computing investment company taxable income or real estate investment trust taxable income for the taxable year. See section 860(f) for the definition of deficiency dividends.

(3) This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.(i) Corporation X, a regulated investment company subject to taxation under section 852 of the Code, which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, incurs WIN expenses of $30,000 during the year 1974. Corporation X's investment company taxable income under section 852 (b)(2) is $10,000 after taking into account a deduction for dividends paid of $90,000.

(ii) Under this paragraph, Corporation X's WIN expenses for the taxable year 1974 is $3,000, computed as follows: (*a*) $30,000 (WIN expenses), multiplied by (*b*) $10,000 (taxable income), divided by (*c*) $100,000 (taxable income plus the deduction for dividends paid). For 1974, the $25,000 amount specified in section 50A(a)(2) is reduced to $2,500.

(c) *Cooperatives.* (1) In the case of a cooperative organization described in section 1381(a)—

(i) The WIN expenses determined under paragraph (a) of § 1.50B-1, and

(ii) The $25,000 amount specified in section 50A(a)(2), relating to limitation based on amount of tax,

shall be reduced to such cooperative's ratable share of each such amount (as determined under subparagraph (2) of this paragraph). If a cooperative organization described in section 1381(a) is a member of a controlled group (as defined in section 50A(a)(5)), the $25,000 amount specified in section 50A(a)(2) shall be reduced in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of § 1.50A-1 before such amount is further reduced under this paragraph.

(2) A cooperative's ratable share of the amount described in subparagraph (1)(i) and the amount described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph shall be the ratio which—

(i) Taxable income for the taxable year, bears to

(ii) Taxable income for the taxable year plus the sum of (*a*) the amount of the deductions allowed under section 1382(b), and (*b*) the amount of the deductions allowed under section 1382(c), and (*c*) amounts similar to the amounts described in (*a*) and (*b*) of this subdivision the tax treatment of which is determined without regard to subchapter T, chapter 1 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.

(3) This paragraph may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.(i) Cooperative X, an organization described in section 1381(a) which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year, incurs WIN expenses of $30,000 for the taxable year 1972. Cooperative X's taxable income is $10,000 after taking into account deductions of $30,000 allowed under section 1382(b), and deductions of $60,000 allowed under section 1382(c).

(ii) Under this paragraph, Cooperative X's WIN expenses for the taxable year 1972 are $3,000, computed as follows: (*a*) $30,000 (WIN expenses), multiplied by (*b*) $10,000 (taxable income), divided by (*c*) $100,000 (taxable income plus the sum of deductions allowed under sections 1382(b) and 1382(c)). For 1972, the $25,000 amount specified in section 50A(a)(2) is reduced to $2,500.
