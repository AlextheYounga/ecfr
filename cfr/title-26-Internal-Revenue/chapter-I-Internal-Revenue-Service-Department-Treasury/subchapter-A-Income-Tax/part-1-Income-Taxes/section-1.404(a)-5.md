##### ยง 1.404(a)-5 Pension and annuity plans; limitations under section 404(a)(1)(B). #####

(a) Subject to the applicable general conditions and limitations (see ยง 1.404(a)-3), under section 404(a)(1)(B), deductions may be allowed to the extent of limitations based on costs determined by distributing the remaining unfunded cost of the past and current service credits with respect to all employees covered under the trust or plan as a level amount or level percentage of compensation over the remaining service of each such employee except that, as to any three individuals with respect to whom more than 50 percent of such remaining unfunded cost attributable to such individuals shall be distributed evenly over a period of at least five taxable years. See, however, paragraph (e) of this section with respect to taxable years to which the limitation under section 404(a)(1)(B) does not apply.

(b) The statutory limitation for any taxable year under section 404(a)(1)(B) is any excess of the amount of the costs described in paragraph (a) of this section for the year over the amount allowable as a deduction under section 404(a)(1)(A).

(c) For this purpose, such excess, adjusted for prior experience, may be computed for each year as follows, all determinations being made as of the beginning of the year:

(1) Determine the value of all benefits expected to be paid, after the beginning of the year for all employees, any former employees, and any other beneficiaries, then covered under the plan.

(2) If employees contribute under the plan, determine the value of all contributions expected to be made after the beginning of the year by employees then covered under the plan.

(3) Determine the value of all funds of the plan as of the beginning of the year.

(4) Determine the amount remaining to be distributed as a level amount or as a level percentage of compensation over the remaining future service of each employee by subtracting from subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the sum of subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph.

(5) Determine the value of all compensation expected to be paid after the beginning of the year to all employees then covered under the plan.

(6) Determine an accrual rate for each employee by dividing subparagraph (5) of this paragraph into subparagraph (4) of this paragraph.

(7) Compute the excess under section 404(a)(1)(B) for the year by multiplying the compensation paid to all employees covered under the plan during the year by any excess of subparagraph (6) of this paragraph over 5 percent. In general, where this method is used, the limitation under section 404(a)(1)(B) will be equal to the excess so computed without further adjustment on account of prior favorable experience, provided all the factors and assumptions used are reasonable in view of all applicable considerations (see ยง 1.404(a)-3) and provided subparagraph (5) of this paragraph is not less than five times the annual rate of compensation in effect at the beginning of the year.

(d) Instead of determining the excess deductible under section 404(a)(1)(B) by the method shown in paragraph (c), such excess may be based upon cost determined by some other method which is reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances. Thus, such excess may be based on the amounts necessary with respect to each individual covered employee to provide the remaining unfunded cost of all his benefits under the plan distributed as a level amount over the period remaining until the normal commencement of his retirement benefits, in accordance with other generally accepted actuarial methods which are reasonable and appropriate in view of the provisions of the plan, the funding medium, and other applicable considerations.

(e) The limitation under section 404(a)(1)(B) shall not be used for purposes of determining the amount deductible for a taxable year of the employer which ends with or within a taxable year of the pension trust during which it is not exempt under section 501(a), or, in the case of an annuity plan, during which it does not meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2), or which ends after the trust or plan has terminated. See ยง 1.404(a)-7 for rules relating to the limitation which is applicable for purposes of determining the amount deductible for such a taxable year of the employer.
