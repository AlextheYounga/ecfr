##### § 1.42-2 Waiver of requirement that an existing building eligible for the low-income housing credit was last placed in service more than 10 years prior to acquisition by the taxpayer. #####

(a) *Low-income housing credit for existing building.* Section 42 provides that, for purposes of section 38, new and existing qualified low-income buildings are eligible for a low-income housing credit. The eligibility rules for new and existing buildings differ. Under section 42(d)(2), an existing building may be eligible for the low-income housing credit based upon the acquisition cost and amounts chargeable to capital account (to the extent properly included in eligible basis) if -

(1) The taxpayer acquires the building by purchase (as defined in section 179(d)(2), as applicable under section 42(d)(2)(D)(iii)(I)),

(2) There is a period of at least 10 years between the date of the building's acquisition by the taxpayer and the later of - (i) The date the building was last placed in service, or

(ii) The date of the most recent nonqualified substantial improvement of the building, and

(3) The building was not previously placed in service by the taxpayer, or by a person who was a related person (as defined in section 42(d)(2)(D)(iii)(II)) with respect to the taxpayer as of the time the building was last previously placed in service.

(b) *Waiver of 10-year holding period requirement.* Section 42(d)(6) provides that a taxpayer may apply for a waiver of the 10-year holding period requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The Internal Revenue Service will grant a waiver only if -

(1) The existing building satisfies all of the requirements in paragraph (c) of this section, and

(2) The taxpayer makes an application in conformity with the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section.

(c) *Waiver requirements* - (1) *Federally-assisted building.* To satisfy the requirement of this paragraph, a building must be a Federally-assisted building. The term “Federally assisted building” means any building which is substantially assisted, financed, or operated under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, section 221(d)(3) or 236 of the National Housing Act, or section 515 of the Housing Act of 1949, as such acts were in effect on October 22, 1986.

(2) *Federal mortgage funds at risk.* To satisfy the requirement of this paragraph, Federal mortgage funds must be at risk with respect to a mortgage that is secured by the building or a project of which the building is a part. For purposes of this paragraph, Federal mortgage funds are at risk if, in the event of a default by the mortgagor on the mortgage secured by the building or the project of which the building is a part -

(i) The mortgage could be assigned to the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Farmers' Home Administration, or

(ii) There could arise a claim against a Federal mortgage insurance fund (or such Department or Administration).

(3) *Statement by the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Farmers' Home Administration.* (i) To satisfy the requirement of this paragraph, a letter or other written statement must be made or received and approved by the national office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Farmers' Home Administration (“the Federal agency”). This letter or statement shall include the following:

(A) A statement that, as of the earlier of the time of the taxpayer's acquisition of the building or the taxpayer's application for a waiver, the building is a Federally-assisted building within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section and identifies the source of Federal assistance;

(B) A statement that a waiver of the 10-year holding period requirement is necessary to avert Federal mortgage funds being at risk within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and

(C) A statement that the Federal agency has taken a Federal agency action as described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.

(ii) The following specified Federal agency actions shall be the only means of satisfying the requirement of this paragraph:

(A) The Federal agency intends to accept an assignment of a mortgage secured by the building or the project of which the building is a part, and such assignment requires payments by the agency or a mortgage insurance fund maintained by the agency to the prior mortgagee;

(B) The Federal agency or a mortgage insurance fund maintained by the agency intends to accept, as a consequence of foreclosure proceedings or otherwise, conveyance of the building or the project of which the building is a part;

(C) The Federal agency or a mortgage insurance fund maintained by the agency intends, as a consequence of default, to take possession of, hold title to, or otherwise assume ownership of the building or the project of which the building is a part; or

(D) The Federal agency has designated the building or the project of which the building is a part as a troubled building or project. A designation of a troubled building or project must satisfy the following requirements:

(*1*) Designation of troubled status must be based on a review by the Federal agency of the financial condition of the building or project and on a determination by the Federal agency of a history of financial distress or mortgage defaults;

(*2*) Designation of troubled status must be made or received and approved by the national office of the Federal agency; and

(*3*) Federal agency regulations or procedures must provide that, in the event of transfer of the ownership of a designated troubled building or project, the building or project may be subject to continued review by the Federal agency. Each Federal agency may prescribe its own standards and procedures for designating a troubled building or project so long as such standards are consistent with the requirements of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(D).

(4) *No prior credit allowed.* The requirement of this paragraph is satisfied only if no prior owner was allowed a low-income housing credit under section 42 for the building.

(d) *Application for waiver* - (1) *Time and manner.* In order to receive a waiver of the 10-year holding period requirement specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a taxpayer must file an application (including the applicable user fee) that complies with the requirements of this paragraph (d) and Rev. Proc. 90-1, 1990-1 I.R.B. 8 (or any subsequent applicable revenue procedure). The application must be filed by a taxpayer who has acquired the building by purchase or who has a binding contract to purchase the building. Such binding contract may be conditioned upon the granting of a waiver under this section. The application may be filed at any time after a binding contract has been entered into, but no later than 12 months after the taxpayer's acquisition of the building. An application for a waiver of the 10-year holding period requirement must not contain a request for a ruling on any other issue arising under section 42 or other sections of the Internal Revenue Code. An application for a waiver of the 10-year holding period requirement must be mailed or delivered to the address listed in section 3.01 of Rev. Proc. 90-1 (or any subsequent applicable revenue procedure).

(i) The taxpayer's name, address and taxpayer identification number;

(ii) The name (if any) and address of the acquired building and the project (if any) of which it is a part;

(iii) The date of acquisition or the date of the binding contract for acquisition of the building by the taxpayer and the expected date of acquisition, the amount of consideration paid or to be paid for the acquisition (including the value of any liabilities assumed by the taxpayer), and the taxpayer's certification that such acquisition is by purchase (as defined in section 179(d)(2), as applicable under section 42 (d)(2)(D)(iii)(I));

(iv) The identity of the person from whom the building is acquired, and whether such person is a Federal agency, a mortgagee holding title to the building, or the mortgagor or prior owner;

(vi) The taxpayer's certification that the building was not previously placed in service by the taxpayer, or by a person who was a related person (as defined in section 42(d)(2)(D)(iii)(II)) with respect to the taxpayer as of the time the building was last placed in service;

(vii) The amount and disposition (e.g., discharge, assignment, assumption, or refinance) of the outstanding mortgage at the time of acquisition and the identities of the mortgagee and mortgagor;

(viii) The taxpayer's certification that no prior owner was allowed a low-income housing credit under section 42 for the building (made to the best of the taxpayer's knowledge, with no documentation from other persons needed to be submitted); and

(ix) The statement from the Federal agency required by paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section.

(3) *Other rules.* (i) In the event that an acquired building will be owned by more than one taxpayer, a single application for waiver may be filed by one taxpayer on behalf of the co-owners if the application contains the names, addresses and taxpayer identification numbers of the other owners. A general partner or a designated limited partner may file an application for waiver on behalf of a partnership.

(ii) In the event that multiple Federally-assisted buildings in a project are being acquired by the taxpayer, a single application for waiver with respect to such buildings may be filed if the application contains the required information set out for the address of each Federally-assisted building involved.

(4) *Effective date of waiver.* A waiver will be effective when granted in writing by the Internal Revenue Service after submission of a completed application for waiver filed under this paragraph (d).

(e) *Effective date of regulations.* The provisions of § 1.42-2 are effective for buildings placed in service by the taxpayer after December 31, 1986.
