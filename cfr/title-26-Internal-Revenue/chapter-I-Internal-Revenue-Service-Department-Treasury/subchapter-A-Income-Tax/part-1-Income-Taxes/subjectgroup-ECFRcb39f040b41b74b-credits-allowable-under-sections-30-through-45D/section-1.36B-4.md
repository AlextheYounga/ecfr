##### § 1.36B-4 Reconciling the premium tax credit with advance credit payments. #####

(a) *Reconciliation* - (1) *Coordination of premium tax credit with advance credit payments* - (i) *In general.* A taxpayer must reconcile the amount of credit allowed under section 36B with advance credit payments on the taxpayer's income tax return for a taxable year. A taxpayer whose premium tax credit for the taxable year exceeds the taxpayer's advance credit payments may receive the excess as an income tax refund. A taxpayer whose advance credit payments for the taxable year exceed the taxpayer's premium tax credit owes the excess as an additional income tax liability.

(ii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.36B-4T(a)(1)(ii).

(iii) *Advance credit payment for a month in which an issuer does not provide coverage.* For purposes of reconciliation, a taxpayer does not have an advance credit payment for a month if the issuer of the qualified health plan in which the taxpayer or a family member is enrolled does not provide coverage for that month.

(2) *Credit computation.* The premium assistance credit amount is computed on the taxpayer's return using the taxpayer's household income and family size for the taxable year. Thus, the taxpayer's contribution amount (household income for the taxable year times the applicable percentage) is determined using the taxpayer's household income and family size at the end of the taxable year. The applicable benchmark plan for each coverage month is determined under § 1.36B-3(f).

(3) *Limitation on additional tax* - (i) *In general.* The additional tax imposed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section on a taxpayer whose household income is less than 400 percent of the Federal poverty line is limited to the amounts provided in the table in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section (or successor tables). For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, the limitation amounts may be adjusted in published guidance, see § 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter, to reflect changes in the consumer price index.

(ii) *Additional tax limitation table.*

|Household income percentage of Federal poverty line|Limitation amount for taxpayers whose tax is determined under  <br/>section 1(c)|Limitation amount for all other taxpayers|
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|                  Less than 200%                   |                                      $300                                      |                  $600                   |
|         At least 200% but less than 300%          |                                      750                                       |                  1,500                  |
|         At least 300% but less than 400%          |                                     1,250                                      |                  2,500                  |

(iii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.36B-4T(a)(3)(iii).

(4) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph (a). In each example the taxpayer enrolls in a higher cost qualified health plan than the applicable benchmark plan:

Example 1. Household income increases.(i) Taxpayer A is single and has no dependents. The Exchange for A's rating area projects A's 2014 household income to be $27,925 (250 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of one, applicable percentage 8.05). A enrolls in a qualified health plan. The annual premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $5,200. A's advance credit payments are $2,952, computed as follows: benchmark plan premium of $5,200 less contribution amount of $2,248 (projected household income of $27,925 × .0805) = $2,952.

(ii) A's household income for 2014 is $33,622, which is 301 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of one (applicable percentage 9.5). Consequently, A's premium tax credit for 2014 is $2,006 (benchmark plan premium of $5,200 less contribution amount of $3,194 (household income of $33,622 × .095)). Because A's advance credit payments for 2014 are $2,952 and A's 2014 credit is $2,006, A has excess advance payments of $946. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, A's tax liability for 2014 is increased by $946. Because A's household income is between 300 percent and 400 percent of the Federal poverty line, if A's excess advance payments exceeded $1,250, under the limitation of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, A's additional tax liability would be limited to that amount.

Example 2. Household income increases, repayment limitation applies.The facts are the same as in *Example 1,* except that A's household income for 2014 is $43,560 (390 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of one, applicable percentage 9.5). Consequently, A's premium tax credit for 2014 is $1,062 ($5,200 benchmark plan premium less contribution amount of $4,138 (household income of $43,560 × .095)). A's advance credit payments for 2014 are $2,952; therefore, A has excess advance payments of $1,890. Because A's household income is between 300 percent and 400 percent of the Federal poverty line, A's additional tax liability for the taxable year is $1,250 under the repayment limitation of paragraph (a)(3) of this section.Example 3. Household income decreases.The facts are the same as in *Example 1,* except that A's actual household income for 2014 is $22,340 (200 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of one, applicable percentage 6.3). Consequently, A's premium tax credit for 2014 is $3,793 ($5,200 benchmark plan premium less contribution amount of $1,407 (household income of $22,340 × .063)). Because A's advance credit payments for 2014 are $2,952, A is allowed an additional credit of $841 ($3,793 less $2,952).

*Example 4.* [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.36B-4T(a)(4), *Example 4.*

Example 5. Repayment limitation does not apply.(i) Taxpayer D is single and has no dependents. The Exchange for D's rating area approves advance credit payments for D based on 2014 household income of $39,095 (350 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of one, applicable percentage 9.5). D enrolls in a qualified health plan. The annual premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $5,200. D's advance credit payments are $1,486, computed as follows: benchmark plan premium of $5,200 less contribution amount of $3,714 (projected household income of $39,095 × .095) = $1,486.

(ii) D's actual household income for 2014 is $44,903, which is 402 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of one. D is not an applicable taxpayer and may not claim a premium tax credit. Additionally, the repayment limitation of paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not apply. Consequently, D has excess advance payments of $1,486 (the total amount of the advance credit payments in 2014). Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, D's tax liability for 2014 is increased by $1,486.

Example 6. Coverage for less than a full taxable year.(i) Taxpayer F is single and has no dependents. In November 2013, the Exchange for F's rating area projects F's 2014 household income to be $27,925 (250 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of one, applicable percentage 8.05). F enrolls in a qualified health plan. The annual premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $5,200. F's monthly advance credit payment is $246, computed as follows: benchmark plan premium of $5,200 less contribution amount of $2,248 (projected household income of $27,925 × .0805) = $2,952; $2,952/12 = $246.

(ii) F begins a new job in August 2014 and is eligible for employer-sponsored minimum essential coverage for the period September through December 2014. F discontinues her Exchange coverage effective November 1, 2014. F's household income for 2014 is $28,707 (257 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family size of one, applicable percentage 8.25).

(iii) Under § 1.36B-3(a), F's premium assistance credit amount is the sum of the premium assistance amounts for the coverage months. Under § 1.36B-3(c)(1)(iii), a month in which an individual is eligible for minimum essential coverage other than coverage in the individual market is not a coverage month. Because F is eligible for employer-sponsored minimum essential coverage as of September 1, only the months January through August of 2014 are coverage months.

(iv) If F had 12 coverage months in 2014, F's premium tax credit would be $2,832 (benchmark plan premium of $5,200 less contribution amount of $2,368 (household income of $28,707 × .0825)). Because F has only eight coverage months in 2014, F's credit is $1,888 ($2,832/12 × 8). Because F does not discontinue her Exchange coverage until November 1, 2014, F's advance credit payments for 2014 are $2,460 ($246 × 10). Consequently, F has excess advance payments of $572 ($2,460 less $1,888) and F's tax liability for 2014 is increased by $572 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Example 7. Changes in coverage months and applicable benchmark plan.(i) Taxpayer E claims one dependent, F. E is eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential coverage. E enrolls F in a qualified health plan for 2014. The Exchange for E's rating area projects E's 2014 household income to be $30,260 (200 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of two, applicable percentage 6.3). The annual premium for E's applicable benchmark plan is $5,200. E's monthly advance credit payment is $275, computed as follows: benchmark plan premium of $5,200 less contribution amount of $1,906 (projected household income of $30,260 × .063) = $3,294; $3,294/12 = $275.

(ii) On August 1, 2014, E loses her eligibility for government-sponsored minimum essential coverage. E enrolls in the qualified health plan that covers F for August through December 2014. The annual premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $10,000. The Exchange computes E's monthly advance credit payments for the period September through December to be $675 as follows: benchmark plan premium of $10,000 less contribution amount of $1,906 (projected household income of $30,260 × .063) = $8,094; $8,094/12 = $675. E's household income for 2014 is $28,747 (190 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 5.84).

(iii) Under § 1.36B-3(c)(1), January through July of 2014 are coverage months for F and August through December are coverage months for E and F. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, E must compute her premium tax credit using the premium for the applicable benchmark plan for each coverage month. E's premium assistance credit amount for 2014 is the sum of the premium assistance amounts for all coverage months. E reconciles her premium tax credit with advance credit payments as follows:

|                  Advance credit payments (Jan. to July)                   |$1,925|    ($275 × 7)    |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----:|:-----------------|
|                  Advance credit payments (Aug. to Dec.)                   |3,375 |    ($675 × 5)    |
|                       Total advance credit payments                       |5,300 |                  |
|                   Benchmark plan premium (Jan. to July)                   |3,033 |(($5,200/12) × 7) |
|                   Benchmark plan premium (Aug. to Dec.)                   |4,167 |(($10,000/12) × 5)|
|                       Total benchmark plan premium                        |7,200 |                  |
|Contribution amount (taxable year household income × applicable percentage)|1,679 |($28,747 × .0584) |
|      Credit (total benchmark plan premium less contribution amount)       |5,521 |                  |

(iv) E's advance credit payments for 2014 are $5,300. E's premium tax credit is $5,521. Thus, E is allowed an additional credit of $221.Example 8. Part-year coverage and changes in coverage months and applicable benchmark plan.(i) The facts are the same as in *Example 7,* except that F is eligible for government-sponsored minimum essential coverage for January and February 2014, and E enrolls F in a qualified health plan beginning in March 2014. Thus, March through July are coverage months for F and August through December are coverage months for E and F.

(ii) E reconciles her premium tax credit with advance credit payments as follows:

|                                 Advance credit payments (March to July)                                  |$1,375|       ($275 × 5)        |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----:|:------------------------|
|                                  Advance credit payments (Aug. to Dec.)                                  |3,375 |       ($675 × 5)        |
|                                      Total advance credit payments                                       |4,750 |                         |
|                                  Benchmark plan premium (March to July)                                  |2,167 |    (($5,200/12) × 5)    |
|                                  Benchmark plan premium (Aug. to Dec.)                                   |4,167 |   (($10,000/12) × 5)    |
|                                       Total benchmark plan premium                                       |6,334 |                         |
|Contribution amount for 10 coverage months (taxable year household income × applicable percentage × 10/12)|1,399 |($28,747 × .0584 × 10/12)|
|                      Credit (total benchmark plan premium less contribution amount)                      |4,935 |                         |

(iii) E's advance credit payments for 2014 are $4,750. E's premium tax credit is $4,935. Thus, E is allowed an additional credit of $185.Example 9. Advance credit payments for months an issuer does not provide coverage.(i) Taxpayer F enrolls in a qualified health plan for 2014 and the Exchange approves advance credit payments. F pays the portion of the premium not covered by advance credit payments for January through April of 2014 but fails to make payments in May, June, and July. As a result, the issuer of the qualified health plan initiates the 3-month grace period under section 1412(c)(2)(B)(iv)(II) of the Affordable Care Act and 45 CFR 156.270(d). During the grace period the issuer continues to receive advance credit payments on behalf of F. On July 1 the issuer rescinds F's coverage retroactive to the end of the first month of the grace period, May 31.

(ii) Under paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, F does not take into account advance credit payments for June or July of 2014 when reconciling the premium tax credit with advance credit payments under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

*Example 14.* [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.36B-4T(a)(4), *Example 14.*

(b) *Changes in filing status* - (1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) or (b)(3) of this section, a taxpayer whose marital status changes during the taxable year computes the premium tax credit by using the applicable benchmark plan or plans for the taxpayer's marital status as of the first day of each coverage month. The taxpayer's contribution amount (household income for the taxable year times the applicable percentage) is determined using the taxpayer's household income and family size at the end of the taxable year.

(2) *Taxpayers who marry during the taxable year* - (i) *In general.* Taxpayers who marry during and file a joint return for the taxable year may compute the additional tax imposed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Only taxpayers who are unmarried at the beginning of the taxable year and are married (within the meaning of section 7703) at the end of the taxable year, at least one of whom receives advance credit payments, may use this alternative computation.

(ii) *Alternative computation of additional tax liability* - (A) *In general.* The additional tax liability determined under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii) is equal to the excess of the taxpayers' advance credit payments for the taxable year over the amount of the alternative marriage-year credit. The alternative marriage-year credit is the sum of both taxpayers' alternative premium assistance amounts for the pre-marriage months and the premium assistance amounts for the marriage months. This paragraph (b)(2)(ii) may not be used to increase the additional premium tax credit computed under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

(B) *Alternative premium assistance amounts for pre-marriage months.* Taxpayers compute the alternative premium assistance amounts for each taxpayer for each full or partial month the taxpayers are unmarried as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, except that each taxpayer treats the amount of household income as one-half of the actual household income for the taxable year and treats family size as the number of individuals in the taxpayer's family prior to the marriage. The taxpayers may include a dependent of the taxpayers for the taxable year in either taxpayer's family size for the pre-marriage months.

(C) *Premium assistance amounts for marriage months.* Taxpayers compute the premium assistance amounts for each full month the taxpayers are married as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(3) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.36B-4T(b)(3).

(4) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.36B-4T(b)(4).

(5) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (b). In each example the taxpayer enrolls in a higher cost qualified health plan than the applicable benchmark plan:

Example 1. Taxpayers marry during the taxable year, general rule for computing additional tax.(i) P is a single taxpayer with no dependents. In 2013 the Exchange for the rating area where P resides determines that P's 2014 household income will be $40,000 (358 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 9.5). P enrolls in a qualified health plan. The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $5,200. P's monthly advance credit payment is $117, computed as follows: $5,200 benchmark plan premium minus contribution amount of $3,800 ($40,000 × .095) equals $1,400 (total advance credit payment); $1,400/12 = $117.

(ii) Q is a single taxpayer with two dependents. In 2013 the Exchange for the rating area where Q resides determines that Q's 2014 household income will be $35,000 (183 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 5.52). Q enrolls in a qualified health plan. The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $10,000. Q's monthly advance credit payment is $672, computed as follows: $10,000 benchmark plan premium minus contribution amount of $1,932 ($35,000 × .0552) equals $8,068 (total advance credit); $8,068/12 = $672.

(iii) P and Q marry on July 17, 2014 and enroll in a single policy for a qualified health plan covering four family members, effective August 1, 2014. The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $14,000. Based on household income of $75,000 and a family size of four (325 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 9.5), the Exchange approves advance credit payments of $573 per month, computed as follows: $14,000 benchmark plan premium minus contribution amount of $7,125 ($75,000 × .095) equals $6,875 (total advance credit); $6,875/12 = $573.

(iv) P and Q file a joint return for 2014 and report $75,000 in household income and a family size of four. P and Q compute their credit at reconciliation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. They use the premiums for the applicable benchmark plans that apply for the months married and the months not married, and their contribution amount is based on their Federal poverty line percentage at the end of the taxable year. P and Q reconcile their premium tax credit with advance credit payments as follows:

|                   Advance payments for P (Jan. to July)                   | $819 |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----:|
|                   Advance payments for Q (Jan. to July)                   |4,704 |
|                Advance payments for P and Q (Aug. to Dec.)                |2,865 |
|                          Total advance payments                           |8,388 |
|                Benchmark plan premium for P (Jan. to July)                |3,033 |
|                Benchmark plan premium for Q (Jan. to July)                |5,833 |
|             Benchmark plan premium for P and Q (Aug. to Dec.)             |5,833 |
|                       Total benchmark plan premium                        |14,699|
|Contribution amount (taxable year household income × applicable percentage)|7,125 |
|      Credit (total benchmark plan premium less contribution amount)       |7,574 |
|                              Additional tax                               | 814  |

(v) P's and Q's tax liability for 2014 is increased by $814 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.Example 2. Taxpayers marry during the taxable year, alternative computation of additional tax.(i) The facts are the same as in *Example 1,* except that P and Q compute their additional tax liability under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. P's and Q's additional tax is the excess of their advance credit payments for the taxable year ($8,388) over their alternative marriage-year credit, which is the sum of the alternative premium assistance amounts for the pre-marriage months and the premium assistance amounts for the marriage months.

(ii) P and Q compute the alternative marriage-year credit as follows:

|            Alternative premium assistance amounts for pre-marriage months:            |      |                        |

|                     Premium assistance amount for marriage months                     |2,864 |    ($5,833−$2,969)     |

Alternative marriage-year credit (sum of premium assistance amounts for pre-marriage months and marriage months): $955 + $4,494 + $2,864 = $8,313.

(iii) P and Q reconcile their premium tax credit with advance credit payments by determining the excess of their advance credit payments ($8,388) over their alternative marriage-year credit ($8,313). P and Q must increase their tax liability by $75 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Example 3. Taxpayers marry during the taxable year, alternative computation of additional tax, alternative marriage-year tax credit exceeds advance credit payments.The facts are the same as in *Example 2,* except that the amount of P's and Q's advance credit payments is $8,301. Thus, their alternative marriage-year credit ($8,313) exceeds the amount of their advance credit payments ($8,301). Under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, the amount of additional tax liability and additional tax credit that P and Q report on their tax return is $0.Example 4. Taxpayers marry during the taxable year, alternative computation of additional tax.(i) Taxpayer R is single and has no dependents. In 2013, the Exchange for the rating area where R resides determines that R's 2014 household income will be $40,000 (358 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 9.5). R enrolls in a qualified health plan. The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $5,200. R's monthly advance credit payment is $117, computed as follows: $5,200 benchmark plan premium minus contribution amount of $3,800 ($40,000 × .095) = $1,400 (total advance credit); $1,400/12 = $117.

(ii) Taxpayer S is single with no dependents. In 2013, the Exchange for the rating area where S resides determines that S's 2014 household income will be $20,000 (179 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 5.33). S enrolls in a qualified health plan. The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $5,200. S's monthly advance credit payment is $345, computed as follows: $5,200 benchmark plan premium minus contribution amount of $1,066 ($20,000 × .0533) = $4,134 (total advance credit); $4,134/12 = $345.

(iii) R and S marry in September 2014 and enroll in a single policy for a qualified health plan covering them both, beginning October 1, 2014. The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $10,000. Based on household income of $60,000 and a family size of two (397 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 9.5), R's and S's monthly advance credit payment is $358, computed as follows: $10,000 benchmark plan premium minus contribution amount of $5,700 ($60,000 × .095) = $4,300; $4,300/12 = $358. R's and S's advance credit payments for 2014 are $5,232, computed as follows:

|  Advance payments for R (Jan. to Sept.)   |$1,053|($117 × 9)|
|:------------------------------------------|-----:|:---------|
|  Advance payments for S (Jan. to Sept.)   |3,105 |($345 × 9)|
|Advance payments for R and S (Oct. to Dec.)|1,074 |($358 × 3)|
|          Total advance payments           |5,232 |          |

(iv) R and S file a joint return for 2014 and report $62,000 in household income and a family size of two (410 percent of the FPL for a family of 2). Thus, under § 1.36B-2(b)(2), R and S are not applicable taxpayers for 2014 and may not claim a premium tax credit for 2014. However, they compute their additional tax liability under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. R's and S's additional tax is the excess of their advance credit payments for the taxable year ($5,232) over their alternative marriage-year credit, which is the sum of the alternative premium assistance amounts for the pre-marriage months and the premium assistance amounts for the marriage months. In this case, R and S have no premium assistance amounts for the married months because their household income is over 400 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of 2.

(v) R and S compute their alternative marriage-year credit as follows:

|                   Premium assistance amount for pre-marriage months:                   |      |                        |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----:|:-----------------------|
|                      Benchmark plan premium for R (Jan. to Sept.)                      |$3,900|   (($5,200/12) × 9)    |
|Contribution amount ((1/2 taxable year household income × applicable percentage) × 9/12)|2,053 |($31,000 × .0883 × 9/12)|
|                 Premium assistance amount for R's pre-marriage months                  |1,847 |   ($3,900 − $2,053)    |
|                      Benchmark plan premium for S (Jan. to Sept.)                      |3,900 |   (($5,200/12) × 9)    |
|Contribution amount ((1/2 taxable year household income × applicable percentage) × 9/12)|2,053 |($31,000 × .0883 × 9/12)|
|                 Premium assistance amount for S's pre-marriage months                  |1,847 |    ($3,900−$2,053)     |
|                     Premium assistance amount for marriage months                      |  0   |                        |

Alternative marriage-year credit (sum of premium assistance amounts for pre-marriage months and marriage months): $1,847 + 1,847 + 0 = $3,694.

(vi) R and S reconcile their premium tax credit with advance credit payments by determining the excess of their advance credit payments ($5,232) over their alternative marriage-year credit ($3,694). R and S must increase their tax liability by $1,538 under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

Example 5.(i) *Taxpayers marry during the taxable year, no additional tax liability.* The facts are the same as in *Example 4,* except that S has no income and is enrolled in Medicaid for January through September 2014 and R's and S's household income for 2014 is $37,000 (245 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 7.88). Their advance credit payments for 2014 are $2,707 ($1,053 for R for January to September and $1,654 for R and S for October to December). Their premium tax credit for 2014 is $3,484 (total benchmark premium of $6,400 less contribution amount of $2,916).

(ii) Because R's and S's premium tax credit of $3,484 exceeds their advance credit payments of $2,707, R and S are allowed an additional credit of $777. Although R and S marry in 2014, paragraph (b)(2) of this section (the alternative computation of additional tax for taxpayers who marry during the taxable year) does not apply because they do not owe additional tax for 2014.

Example 6. Taxpayers divorce during the taxable year, 50 percent allocation.(i) Taxpayers V and W are married and have two dependents. In 2013, the Exchange for the rating area where the family resides determines that their 2014 household income will be $76,000 (330 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of 4, applicable percentage 9.5). V and W enroll in a qualified health plan for 2014. The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $14,100. The Exchange approves advance credit payments of $573 per month, computed as follows: $14,100 benchmark plan premium minus V and W's contribution amount of $7,220 ($76,000 × .095) equals $6,880 (total advance credit); $6,880/12 = $573.

(ii) V and W divorce on June 17, 2014, and obtain separate qualified health plans beginning July 1, 2014. V enrolls based on household income of $60,000 and a family size of three (314 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 9.5). The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $10,000. The Exchange approves advance credit payments of $358 per month, computed as follows: $10,000 benchmark plan premium minus V's contribution amount of $5,700 ($60,000 × .095) equals $4,300 (total advance credit); $4,300/12 = $358.

(iii) W enrolls based on household income of $16,420 and a family size of one (147 percent of the Federal poverty line, applicable percentage 3.82). The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $5,200. The Exchange approves advance credit payments of $381 per month, computed as follows: $5,200 benchmark plan premium minus W's contribution amount of $627 ($16,420 × .0382) equals $4,573 (total advance credit); $4,573/12 = $381. V and W do not agree on an allocation of the premium for the applicable benchmark plan, the premiums for the plan in which they enroll, and the advance credit payments for the period they were married in the taxable year.

(iv) V and W each compute their credit at reconciliation under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, using the premiums for the applicable benchmark plans that apply to them for the months married and the months not married, and the contribution amount based on their Federal poverty line percentages at the end of the taxable year. Under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, because V and W do not agree on an allocation, V and W must equally allocate the benchmark plan premium ($7,050) and the advance credit payments ($3,438) for the six-month period January through June 2014 when they are married and enrolled in the same qualified health plan. Thus, V and W each are allocated $3,525 of the benchmark plan premium ($7,050/2) and $1,719 of the advance credit payments ($3,438/2) for January through June.

(v) V reports on his 2014 tax return $60,000 in household income and family size of three. W reports on her 2014 tax return $16,420 in household income and family size of one. V and W reconcile their premium tax credit with advance credit payments as follows:

|                                                                           |  V   |  W   |

|                              Additional tax                               |1,042 |      |

(vi) Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, on their tax returns V's tax liability is increased by $1,042 and W is allowed $1,493 as additional credit.Example 7. Taxpayers divorce during the taxable year, allocation in proportion to household income.(i) The facts are the same as in *Example 6,* except that V and W decide to allocate the benchmark plan premium ($7,050) and the advance credit payments ($3,438) for January through June 2014 in proportion to their household incomes (79 percent and 21 percent). Thus, V is allocated $5,570 of the benchmark plan premiums ($7,050 × .79) and $2,716 of the advance credit payments ($3,438 × .79), and W is allocated $1,481 of the benchmark plan premiums ($7,050 × .21) and $722 of the advance credit payments ($3,438 × .21). V and W reconcile their premium tax credit with advance credit payments as follows:

|                                                                           |  V   |  W  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-----|
|                 Allocated advance payments (Jan. to June)                 |$2,716|$722 |
|                  Actual advance payments (July to Dec.)                   |2,148 |2,286|
|                          Total advance payments                           |4,864 |3,008|
|              Allocated benchmark plan premium (Jan. to June)              |5,570 |1,481|
|               Actual benchmark plan premium (July to Dec.)                |5,000 |2,600|

|Contribution amount (taxable year household income × applicable percentage)|5,700 | 627 |

|                             Additional credit                             |  6   | 446 |

(ii) Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, on their tax returns V is allowed an additional credit of $6 and W is allowed an additional credit of $446.Example 8. Married taxpayers filing separate tax returns.(i) Taxpayers X and Y are married and have two dependents. In 2013, the Exchange for the rating area where the family resides determines that their 2014 household income will be $76,000 (330 percent of the Federal poverty line for a family of 4, applicable percentage 9.5). W and Y enroll in a qualified health plan for 2014. The premium for the applicable benchmark plan is $14,100. X's and Y's monthly advance credit payment is $573, computed as follows: $14,100 benchmark plan premium minus X's and Y's contribution amount of $7,220 ($76,000 × .095) equals $6,880 (total advance credit); $6,880/12 = $573.

(ii) X and Y file income tax returns for 2014 using a married filing separately filing status. X reports household income of $60,000 and a family size of three (314 percent of the Federal poverty line). Y reports household income of $16,420 and a family size of one (147 percent of the Federal poverty line).

(iii) Because X and Y are married but do not file a joint return for 2014, X and Y are not applicable taxpayers and are not allowed a premium tax credit for 2014. See § 1.36B-2(b)(2). Under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, half of the advance credit payments ($6,880/2 = $3,440) is allocated to X and half is allocated to Y for purposes of determining their excess advance payments. The repayment limitation described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section applies to X and Y based on the household income and family size reported on each return. Consequently, X's tax liability for 2014 is increased by $2,500 and Y's tax liability for 2014 is increased by $600.
