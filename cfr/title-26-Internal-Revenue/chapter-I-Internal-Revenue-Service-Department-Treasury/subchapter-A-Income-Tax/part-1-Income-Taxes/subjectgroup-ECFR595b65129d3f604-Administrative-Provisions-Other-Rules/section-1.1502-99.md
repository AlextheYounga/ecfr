(a) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and § 1.1502-98 apply to any testing date on or after June 25, 1999. Sections 1.1502-94 through 1.1502-96 also apply to a corporation that becomes a member of a group or ceases to be a member of a group (or loss subgroup) on any date on or after June 25, 1999.

(b) *Special rules* - (1) *Election to treat subgroup parent requirement as satisfied.* Section 1.1502-91(d)(4), § 1.1502-91(d)(7), Example 4, § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(iii), § 1.1502-92(b)(2), Example 5, the last two sentences of § 1.1502-95(b)(3), § 1.1502-95(d)(2)(i), and § 1.1502-96(e)(all of which relate to the election under § 1.1502-91(d)(4) to treat the loss subgroup parent requirement as satisfied) apply to corporations that become members of a consolidated group in taxable years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.

(2) *Principal purpose of avoiding a limitation.* The third sentence of § 1.1502-91(d)(5) (relating to members excluded from a loss subgroup) applies to corporations that become members of a consolidated group on or after June 25, 1999.

(3) *Ceasing to be a member of a loss subgroup* - (i) *Ownership change of a loss subgroup.* Section 1.1502-95(d)(2)(ii) and § 1.1502-95(d)(3), Example 3 apply to corporations that cease to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to a loss subgroup parent in taxable years for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.

(ii) *Expiration of 5-year period.* Section 1.1502-95(d)(2)(iii) applies with respect to the day after the last day of any 5 consecutive year period described in that section that ends in a taxable year for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999.

(4) *Reattribution of losses under § 1.1502-36(d)(6).* Section 1.1502-96(d) applies to reattributions of net operating loss carryovers, capital loss carryovers, and deferred deductions in connection with a transfer of stock to which § 1.1502-36 applies, and the election under § 1.1502-96(d)(5) (relating to an election to reattribute section 382 limitation) can be made with an election under § 1.1502-36(d)(6) to reattribute a loss to the common parent that is filed at the time and in the manner provided in § 1.1502-36(e)(5)(x).

(5) *Election to apportion net unrealized built-in gain.* In the case of corporations that cease to be members of a loss group (or loss subgroup) before June 25, 1999 in a taxable year for which the due date of the income tax return (without extensions) is after June 25, 1999, § 1.1502-95(a), (b), (c), and (f) apply to those corporations if the common parent makes the election described in the second sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of § 1.1502-95 in the time and manner prescribed in paragraph (f) of § 1.1502-95.

(c) *Testing period may include a period beginning before June 25, 1999* -

(1) *In general.* A testing period for purposes of §§ 1.1502-91 through 1.1502-96 and 1.1502-98 may include a period beginning before June 25, 1999. Thus, for example, in applying § 1.1502-92(b)(1)(i)(relating to the determination of an ownership change of a loss group), the determination of the lowest percentage of ownership interest of any 5-percent shareholder of the common parent during a testing period ending on a testing date occurring on or after June 25, 1999 takes into account the period beginning before June 25, 1999, except to the extent that the period is more than 3 years before the testing date or is otherwise before the beginning of the testing period. See § 1.1502-92(b)(1).

(2) *Transition rule for net unrealized built-in loss.* A loss group (or loss subgroup) that has a net unrealized built-in loss on a testing date on or after June 25, 1999 may apply § 1.1502-91A(g) (and § 1.1502-96A(a) as it relates to § 1.1502-91A(g)) for the period ending on the day before June 25, 1999 to determine under § 1.382-2T(d)(ii)(A) the earliest date that its testing period begins (treating the day before June 25, 1999 as the end of a taxable year.) Thus, for example, if a consolidated group with no net operating losses has a net unrealized built-in loss determined under § 1.1502-91(g) on a testing date after June 25, 1999, but, under § 1.1502-91A(g), does not have a net unrealized built-in loss for the period ending on the day before June 25, 1999, the group's testing period begins no earlier than June 25, 1999.
