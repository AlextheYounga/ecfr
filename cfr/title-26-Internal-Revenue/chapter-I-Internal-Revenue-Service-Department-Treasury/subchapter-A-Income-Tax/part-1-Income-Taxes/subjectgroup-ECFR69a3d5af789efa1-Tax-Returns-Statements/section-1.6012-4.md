[T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44231, Dec. 23, 1974, as amended by T.D. 9849, 84 FR 9237, Mar. 14, 2019] Editorial Note:For the convenience of the user §§ 16.15 and 17.16 of 26 CFR (1939) are set forth below:**§ 16.15 Annual reports for income taxable years.**

(a) *General requirements.* Every contracting party completing a contract or subcontract within the contracting party's income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 shall file with the district director of internal revenue for the internal revenue district in which the contracting party's Federal income tax returns are required to be filed an annual report on the prescribed form of the profit and excess profit on all contracts and subcontracts coming within the scope of the act and the regulations in this part and completed within the particular income-taxable year. There shall be included as a part of such a report a statement, preferably in columnar form, showing separately for each such contract or subcontract completed by the contracting party within the income-taxable year the total contract price, the cost of performing the contract or subcontract and the resulting profit or loss on each contract or subcontract together with a summary statement showing in detail the computation of the net profit or net loss upon all contracts and subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year and the amount of the excess profit, if any, for the income-taxable year covered by the report. A copy of the report made to the Secretary of the Army (see § 16.14) with respect to each contract or subcontract covered in the annual report, shall be filed as a part of such annual report. In case the income-taxable year of the contracting party is a period of less than twelve months (see § 16.1), the report required by this section shall be made for such period and not for a full year.

(b) *Time for filing annual reports.* Annual reports of contracts and subcontracts coming within the scope of the act and the regulations in this part completed by a contracting party within an income-taxable year must be filed on or before the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the contracting party's income-taxable year. It is important that the contracting party render on or before the due date an annual report as nearly complete and final as it is possible for the contracting party to prepare. An extension of time granted the contracting party for filing its Federal income tax return does not serve to extend the time for filing the annual report required by this section. Authority consistent with authorizations for granting extensions of time for filing Federal income tax returns is hereby delegated to the various collectors of internal revenue for granting extensions of time for filing the reports required by this section. Application for extensions of time for filing such reports should be addressed to the district director of internal revenue for the district in which the contracting party files its Federal income tax returns and must contain a full recital of the causes for the delay.

If any contracts or subcontracts so completed by the contracting party were entered into for the construction or manufacture of any complete naval vessel or any portion thereof, the profit and excess profit on all such contracts and subcontracts completed within the income-taxable year ending after April 3, 1939 shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of § 17.6.
