##### § 1.1502-95A Rules on ceasing to be a member of a consolidated group generally applicable for corporations ceasing to be members before June 25, 1999. #####

(a) *In general*—(1) *Consolidated group.* This section provides rules for applying section 382 on or after the day that a member ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup). The rules concern how to determine whether an ownership change occurs with respect to losses of the member, and how a consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) is apportioned to the member. As the context requires, a reference in this section to a loss group, a member, or a corporation also includes a reference to a loss subgroup, and a reference to a consolidated section 382 limitation also includes a reference to a subgroup section 382 limitation.

(2) *Election by common parent.* Only the common parent (not the loss subgroup parent) may make the election under paragraph (c) of this section to apportion either a consolidated section 382 limitation or a subgroup section 382 limitation.

(3) *Coordination with §§ 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-93A.* For rules regarding the determination of whether there is an ownership change of a loss subgroup and the computation of a subgroup section 382 limitation following such an ownership change, see §§ 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-93A.

(b) *Separate application of section 382 when a member leaves a consolidated group*—(1) *In general.* Except as provided in §§ 1.1502-91A through 1.1502-93A (relating to rules applicable to loss groups and loss subgroups), section 382 and the regulations thereunder apply to a corporation on a separate entity basis after it ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (or loss subgroup). Solely for purposes of determining whether a corporation has an ownership change—

(i) Any portion of a consolidated net operating loss that is apportioned to the corporation under § 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable is treated as a net operating loss of the corporation beginning on the first day of the taxable year in which the loss arose;

(ii) The testing period may include the period during which (or before which) the corporation was a member of the group (or loss subgroup); and

(iii) Except to the extent provided in § 1.1502-20(g) (relating to reattributed losses), the day it ceases to be a member of a consolidated group is treated as a testing date of the corporation within the meaning of § 1.382-2(a)(4).

(2) *Effect of a prior ownership change of the group.* If a loss group has had an ownership change under § 1.1502-92A before a corporation ceases to be a member of a consolidated group (the former member)—

(i) Any pre-change consolidated attribute that is subject to a consolidated section 382 limitation continues to be treated as a pre-change loss with respect to the former member after the attribute is apportioned to the former member;

(ii) The former member's section 382 limitation with respect to such attribute is zero except to the extent the common parent apportions under paragraph (c) of this section all or a part of the consolidated section 382 limitation to the former member;

(iii) The testing period for determining a subsequent ownership change with respect to such attribute begins no earlier than the first day following the loss group's most recent change date; and

(iv) As generally provided under section 382, an ownership change of the former member that occurs on or after the day it ceases to be a member of a loss group may result in an additional, lesser limitation amount with respect to such loss.

(3) *Application in the case of a loss subgroup.* If two or more former members are included in the same loss subgroup immediately after they cease to be members of a consolidated group, the principles of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section apply to the loss subgroup. Therefore, for example, an apportionment by the common parent under paragraph (c) of this section is made to the loss subgroup rather than separately to its members.

(4) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (b).

Example 1. Treatment of departing member as a separate corporation throughout the testing period.(a) A owns all the L stock. L owns all the stock of L1 and L2. The L group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3. On January 12, Year 2, A sells 30 percent of the L stock to B. On February 7, Year 3, L sells 40 percent of the L2 stock to C, and L2 ceases to be a member of the group. A portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss is apportioned to L2 under § 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable and is carried to L2's first separate return year, which ends December 31, Year 3. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:![](/graphics/er27jn96.017.gif)(b) Under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, L2 is a loss corporation on February 7, Year 3. Under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, February 7, Year 3, is a testing date. Under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the testing period for L2 with respect to this testing date commences on January 1, Year 1, the first day of the taxable year in which the portion of the consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 arose. Therefore, in determining whether L2 has an ownership change on February 7, Year 3, B's purchase of 30 percent of the L stock and C's purchase of 40 percent of the L2 stock are each owner shifts. L2 has an ownership change under section 382(g) and § 1.382-2T because B and C have increased their ownership interests in L2 by 18 and 40 percentage points, respectively, during the testing period.Example 2. Effect of prior ownership change of loss group.(a) L owns all the L1 stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L loss group had an ownership change under § 1.1502-92A in Year 2 with respect to a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 and carried over to Year 2 and Year 3. The consolidated section 382 limitation computed solely on the basis of the value of the stock of L is $100. On December 31, Year 2, L1 sells 25 percent of the stock of L2 to B. L2 is apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss which it carries over to its first separate return year ending after December 31, Year 2. L2's separate section 382 limitation with respect to this loss is zero unless L elects to apportion all or a part of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. (See paragraph (c) of this section for rules regarding the apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation.) L apportions $50 of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2.

(b) On December 31, Year 3, L1 sells its remaining 75 percent stock interest in L2 to C, resulting in an ownership change of L2. L2's section 382 limitation computed on the change date with respect to the value of its stock is $30. Accordingly, L2's section 382 limitation for post-change years ending after December 31, Year 3, with respect to its pre-change losses, including the consolidated net operating losses apportioned to it from the L group, is $30, adjusted as required by section 382 and the regulations thereunder.

(c) *Apportionment of a consolidated section 382 limitation*—(1) *In general.* The common parent may elect to apportion all or any part of a consolidated section 382 limitation to a former member (or loss subgroup). See paragraph (e) of this section for the time and manner of making the election to apportion.

(2) *Amount of apportionment.* The common parent may apportion all or part of each element of the consolidated section 382 limitation determined under § 1.1502-93A. For this purpose, the consolidated section 382 limitation consists of two elements—

(i) The value element, which is the element of the limitation determined under section 382(b)(1) (relating to value multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate) without regard to such adjustments as those described in section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused section 382 limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section 382 limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date), section 382(h) (relating to built-in gains and section 338 gains), and section 382(m)(2) (relating to short taxable years); and

(ii) The adjustment element, which is so much (if any) of the limitation for the taxable year during which the former member ceases to be a member of the consolidated group that is attributable to a carryover of unused limitation under section 382(b)(2) or to recognized built-in gains under 382(h).

(3) *Effect of apportionment on the consolidated section 382 limitation.* The value element of the consolidated section 382 limitation for any post-change year ending after the day that a former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is reduced to the extent that it is apportioned under this paragraph (c). The consolidated section 382 limitation for the post-change year in which the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) is also reduced to the extent that the adjustment element for that year is apportioned under this paragraph (c).

(4) *Effect on corporations to which the consolidated section 382 limitation is apportioned.* The amount of the value element that is apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as the amount determined under section 382(b)(1) for purposes of determining the amount of that corporation's (or loss subgroup's) section 382 limitation for any taxable year ending after the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s). Appropriate adjustments must be made to the limitation based on the value element so apportioned for a short taxable year, carryforward of unused limitation, or any other adjustment required under section 382. The adjustment element apportioned to a former member (or loss subgroup) is treated as an adjustment under section 382(b)(2) or section 382(h), as appropriate, for the first taxable year after the member (or members) ceases to be a member (or members).

(5) *Deemed apportionment when loss group terminates.* If a loss group terminates, to the extent the consolidated section 382 limitation is not apportioned under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the consolidated section 382 limitation is deemed to be apportioned to the loss subgroup that includes the common parent, or, if there is no loss subgroup that includes the common parent immediately after the loss group terminates, to the common parent. A loss group terminates on the first day of the first taxable year that is a separate return year with respect to each member of the former loss group.

(6) *Appropriate adjustments when former member leaves during the year.* Appropriate adjustments are made to the consolidated section 382 limitation for the consolidated return year during which the former member (or loss subgroup) ceases to be a member(s) to reflect the inclusion of the former member in the loss group for a portion of that year.

(7) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the principles of this paragraph (c).

Example 1. Consequence of apportionment.(a) L owns all the L1 stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The L group has a $200 consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. At the close of December 31, Year 1, the group has an ownership change under § 1.1502-92A. The ownership change results in a consolidated section 382 limitation of $10 based on the value of the stock of the group. On August 29, Year 2, L1 sells 30 percent of the stock of L2 to A. L2 is apportioned $90 of the group's $200 consolidated net operating loss under § 1.1502-21(b) or 1.1502-21T(b) in effect prior to June 25, 1999, as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised April 1, 1999, as applicable. L, the common parent, elects to apportion $6 of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:![](/graphics/er27jn96.018.gif)(b) For its separate return years ending after August 29, Year 2 (other than the taxable year ending December 31, Year 2), L2's section 382 limitation with respect to the $90 of the group's net operating loss apportioned to it is $6, adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment. For its consolidated return years ending after August 29, Year 2, (other than the year ending December 31, Year 2) the L group's consolidated section 382 limitation with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change consolidated attribute is $4 ($10 minus the $6 value element apportioned to L2), adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.

(c) For the L group's consolidated return year ending December 31, Year 2, the value element of its consolidated section 382 limitation is increased by $4 (rounded to the nearest dollar), to account for the period during which L2 was a member of the L group ($6, the consolidated section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, times 241/365, the ratio of the number of days during Year 2 that L2 is a member of the group to the number of days in the group's consolidated return year). See paragraph (c)(6) of this section. Therefore, the value element of the consolidated section 382 limitation for Year 2 of the L group is $8 (rounded to the nearest dollar).

(d) The section 382 limitation for L2's short taxable year ending December 31, Year 2, is $2 (rounded to the nearest dollar), which is the amount that bears the same relationship to $6, the value element of the consolidated section 382 limitation apportioned to L2, as the number of days during that short taxable year, 124 days, bears to 365. See § 1.382-4(c).

Example 2. Consequence of no apportionment.The facts are the same as in *Example 1,* except that L does not elect to apportion any portion of the consolidated section 382 limitation to L2. For its separate return years ending after August 29, Year 2, L2's section 382 limitation with respect to the $90 of the group's pre-change consolidated attribute apportioned to L2 is zero under paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section. Thus, the $90 consolidated net operating loss apportioned to L2 cannot offset L2's taxable income in any of its separate return years ending after August 29, Year 2. For its consolidated return years ending after August 29, Year 2, the L group's consolidated section 382 limitation with respect to the remaining $110 of pre-change consolidated attribute is $10, adjusted, as appropriate, for any short taxable year, unused section 382 limitation, or other adjustment.Example 3. Apportionment of adjustment element.The facts are the same as in *Example 1,* except that L2 ceases to be a member of the L group on August 29, Year 3, and the L group has a $4 carryforward of an unused consolidated section 382 limitation (under section 382(b)(2)) to the 1993 consolidated return year.

The carryover of unused limitation increases the consolidated section 382 limitation for the Year 3 consolidated return year from $10 to $14. L may elect to apportion all or any portion of the $10 value element and all or any portion of the $4 adjustment element to L2.

(d) *Rules pertaining to ceasing to be a member of a loss subgroup*—(1) *In general.* A corporation ceases to be a member of a loss subgroup—

(i) On the first day of the first taxable year for which it files a separate return; or

(ii) The first day that it ceases to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to the loss subgroup parent (treating for this purpose the loss subgroup parent as the common parent described in section 1504(a)(1)(A)).

(2) *Examples.* The principles of this paragraph (d) are illustrated by the following examples.

Example 1. Basic case.(a) P owns all the L stock, L owns all the L1 stock and L1 owns all the L2 stock. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 2. On December 11, Year 2, P sells all the stock of L to corporation M. Each of L, L1, and L2 is apportioned a portion of the Year 1 consolidated net operating loss, and thereafter each joins with M in filing consolidated returns. Under § 1.1502-92A, the L loss subgroup has an ownership change on December 11, Year 2. The L loss subgroup has a subgroup section 382 limitation of $100. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:![](/graphics/er27jn96.019.gif)(b) On May 22, Year 3, L1 sells 40 percent of the L2 stock to A. L2 carries over a portion of the P group's net operating loss from Year 1 to its separate return year ending December 31, Year 3. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, L2 ceases to be a member of the L loss subgroup on May 22, Year 3, which is both (1) the first day of the first taxable year for which it files a separate return and (2) the day it ceases to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to the loss subgroup parent, L. The net operating loss of L2 that is carried over from the P group is treated as a pre-change loss of L2 for its separate return years ending after May 22, Year 3. Under paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(2) of this section, the separate section 382 limitation with respect to this loss is zero unless M elects to apportion all or a part of the subgroup section 382 limitation of the L loss subgroup to L2.Example 2. Formation of a new loss subgroup.The facts are the same as in *Example 1,* except that A purchases 40 percent of the L1 stock from L rather than purchasing L2 stock from L1. L1 and L2 file a consolidated return for their first taxable year ending after May 22, Year 3, and each of L1 and L2 carries over a part of the net operating loss of the P group that arose in Year 1. Under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, L1 and L2 cease to be members of the L loss subgroup on May 22, Year 3. The net operating losses carried over from the P group are treated as pre-change subgroup attributes of the loss subgroup composed of L1 and L2. The subgroup section 382 limitation with respect to those losses is zero unless M elects to apportion all or part of the subgroup section 382 limitation of the L loss subgroup to the L1 loss subgroup. The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:![](/graphics/er27jn96.020.gif)Example 3. Ceasing to bear a section 1504(a)(1) relationship to a loss subgroup parent.(a) A owns all the stock of P, and P owns all the stock of L1 and L2. The P group has a consolidated net operating loss arising in Year 1 that is carried over to Year 3 and Year 4. Corporation M acquires all the stock of P on November 11, Year 3, and P, L1, and L2 thereafter file consolidated returns with M. M's acquisition results in an ownership change of the P loss subgroup under § 1.1502-92A(b)(1)(ii). The following is a graphic illustration of these facts:![](/graphics/er27jn96.021.gif)(b) P distributes the L2 stock to M on October 7, Year 4. L2 ceases to be a member of the P loss subgroup on October 7, Year 4, the first day that it ceases to bear the relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to P, the P loss subgroup parent. See paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section. Thus, the section 382 limitation with respect to the pre-change subgroup attributes attributable to L2 is zero except to the extent M elects to apportion all or a part of the subgroup section 382 limitation of the P loss subgroup to L2.Example 4. Relationship through a successor.The facts are the same as in *Example 3,* except that, instead of P's distributing the stock of L2, L2 merges into L1 on October 7, Year 4. L1 (as successor to L2 in the merger within the meaning of § 1.382-2T(f)(4)) continues to bear a relationship described in section 1504(a)(1) to P, the loss subgroup parent. Thus, L2 does not cease to be a member of the P loss subgroup as a result of the merger.

(e) *Filing the election to apportion*—(1) *Form of the election to apportion.* An election under paragraph (c) of this section must be made by the common parent. The election must be made in the form of the following statement: “THIS IS AN ELECTION UNDER § 1.1502-95A OF THE INCOME TAX REGULATIONS TO APPORTION ALL OR PART OF THE [insert either CONSOLIDATED SECTION 382 LIMITATION or SUBGROUP SECTION 382 LIMITATION, as appropriate] TO [insert name and E.I.N. of the corporation (or the corporations that compose a new loss subgroup) to which allocation is made]. The declaration must also include the following information, as appropriate—

(i) The date of the ownership change that resulted in the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation);

(ii) The amount of the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) for the taxable year during which the former member (or new loss subgroup) ceases to be a member of the consolidated group (determined without regard to any apportionment under this section;

(iii) The amount of the value element and adjustment element of the consolidated section 382 limitation (or subgroup section 382 limitation) that is apportioned to the former member (or new loss subgroup) pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section; and

(iv) The name and E.I.N. of the common parent making the apportionment.

(2) *Signing of the election.* The election statement must be signed by both the common parent and the former member (or, in the case of a loss subgroup, the common parent and the loss subgroup parent) by persons authorized to sign their respective income tax returns.

(3) *Filing of the election.* The election statement must be filed by the common parent of the group that is apportioning the consolidated section 382 limitation (or the subgroup section 382 limitation) with its income tax return for the taxable year in which the former member (or new loss subgroup) ceases to be a member. The common parent must also deliver a copy of the statement to the former member (or the members of the new loss subgroup) on or before the day the group files its income tax return for the consolidated return year that the former member (or new loss subgroup) ceases to be a member. A copy of the statement must be attached to the first return of the former member (or the first return in which the members of a new loss subgroup join) that is filed after the close of the consolidated return year of the group of which the former member (or the members of a new loss subgroup) ceases to be a member.

(4) *Revocation of election.* An election statement made under paragraph (c) of this section is revocable only with the consent of the Commissioner.
