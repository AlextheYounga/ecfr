If the section 721(c) partnership has an information return filing obligation under section 6031, that requirement is not affected by the requirement of this paragraph (b)(4) that the U.S. transferor treat the partnership as a foreign partnership.

(5) *Extension of period of limitations on assessment of tax.* In order to comply with the gain deferral method, a U.S. transferor must extend the period of limitations on the assessment of tax:

(i) With respect to the gain realized but not recognized on a gain deferral contribution, through the close of the eighth full taxable year following the U.S. transferor's taxable year that includes the date of the gain deferral contribution;

(iii) With respect to the gain recognized on a contribution of section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership for which the gain deferral method is not applied, if the contribution occurs within five partnership taxable years following a partnership taxable year that includes the date of a gain deferral contribution, through the close of the fifth full taxable year following the U.S. transferor's taxable year that includes the date of the contribution on which gain is recognized.

(c) *Information with respect to section 721(c) partnerships and related foreign persons* - (1) *Effectively connected income.* If the gain deferral method is applied with respect to a contribution of section 721(c) property that satisfies the condition in § 1.721(c)-3T(b)(1)(ii), the U.S. transferor must obtain a statement from the section 721(c) partnership and from each related foreign person that is a direct or indirect partner in the section 721(c) partnership, titled “Statement of Waiver of Treaty Benefits under § 1.721(c)-6T,” pursuant to which the partner and the partnership waive any claim under any income tax convention (whether or not currently in force at the time of the contribution) to an exemption from U.S. income tax or a reduced rate of U.S. income taxation on income derived from the use of the section 721(c) property for the period during which the section 721(c) property is subject to the gain deferral method.

(2) *Partnerships in tiered-partnership structures applying the gain deferral method.* If the gain deferral method is applied as a result of a transaction described in § 1.721(c)-3T(d), the U.S. transferor must supply all information that a section 721(c) partnership would be required to report under paragraph (b) of this section if the section 721(c) partnership were a U.S. transferor.

(3) *Schedules K-1 for related foreign partners.* If a section 721(c) partnership does not have a filing obligation under section 6031, the U.S. transferor must obtain a Schedule K-1 (Form 8865), Partner's Share of Income, Deduction, Credits, etc., for all related foreign persons that are direct or indirect partners in the section 721(c) partnership.

(d) *Reporting and procedural requirements of a section 721(c) partnership with a section 6031 filing obligation* - (1) *Waiver of treaty benefits.* A section 721(c) partnership with a return filing obligation under section 6031 must include its waiver of treaty benefits described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section with its tax return for the taxable year that includes the date of the gain deferral contribution.

(2) *Information on Schedule K-1.* A section 721(c) partnership with a return filing obligation under section 6031 must provide the relevant information necessary for the U.S. transferor to comply with the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section with the U.S. transferor's Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), Partner's Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc. The partnership must also attach to its Form 1065 a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) for each direct or indirect partner that is a related foreign person with respect to the U.S. transferor.

(e) *Signatory.* The statements required in this section must be signed under penalties of perjury by an agent of the U.S. transferor, the related foreign person that is a direct or indirect partner in the section 721(c) partnership, or the section 721(c) partnership, as applicable, that is authorized to sign under a general or specific power of attorney, or by an appropriate party. For the U.S. transferor, an appropriate party is a person described in § 1.367(a)-8(e)(1). For a partnership with a section 6031 filing obligation, an appropriate party is any party authorized to sign Form 1065.

(f) *Relief for certain failures to file or failures to comply that are not willful* - (1) *In general.* This paragraph (f)(1) provides relief from the failure to comply with the procedural and reporting requirements of the gain deferral method prescribed by § 1.721(c)-3T(b)(3) and provided in paragraph (b) of this section if there is a failure to file or to include information required by this section (failure to comply). A failure to comply will be deemed not to have occurred for purposes of § 1.721(c)-3T(b)(3) if the U.S. transferor demonstrates that the failure was not willful using the procedure provided in this paragraph (f). For this purpose, willful is to be interpreted consistent with the meaning of that term in the context of other civil penalties, which would include a failure due to gross negligence, reckless disregard, or willful neglect. Whether a failure to comply was willful will be determined by the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business & International (or any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such position, as appropriate) (Director) based on all the facts and circumstances. The U.S. transferor must submit a request for relief and an explanation as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section. A U.S. transferor whose failure to comply is determined not to be willful under this paragraph will be subject to a penalty under section 6038B if it fails to satisfy the applicable reporting requirements under that section and does not demonstrate that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. See § 1.6038B-2(h). The determination of whether the failure to comply was willful under this section has no effect on any request for relief made under § 1.6038B-2(h).

(2) *Procedures for establishing that a failure to comply was not willful* - (i) *Time and manner of submission.* A U.S. transferor's statement that a failure to comply was not willful will be considered only if, promptly after the U.S. transferor becomes aware of the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the failure relates that includes the information that should have been included with the original return for such taxable year or that otherwise complies with the rules of this section as well as a written statement explaining the reasons for the failure to comply. The U.S. transferor also must file, with the amended return, a Form 8865, Schedule O, and a statement (as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section), completed and executed as prescribed in forms and instructions, consenting to extend the period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized on the gain deferral contribution to the later of the close of the eighth full taxable year following the taxable year during which the contribution occurred (*date one*), or the close of the third full taxable year ending after the date on which the required information is provided to the Director (*date two*). However, the U.S. transferor is not required to file a Form 8865, Schedule O, with the amended return if both date one is later than date two and a consent to extend the period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized on the gain deferral contribution for the U.S. transferor's taxable year that includes the date of the contribution was previously submitted with a Form 8865, Schedule O. The amended return and either a Form 8865, Schedule O, or a copy of the previously filed Form 8865, Schedule O, as the case may be, must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at the location where the U.S. transferor filed its original return. The U.S. transferor may submit a request for relief from the penalty under section 6038B as part of the same submission. See § 1.6038B-2T(h)(3).

(ii) *Notice requirement.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the U.S. transferor must comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii). If any taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return must be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination. If no taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return must be delivered to the Director.

(g) *Applicability dates* - (1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section, this section applies with respect to contributions occurring on or after January 18, 2017, and with respect to contributions occurring before January 18, 2017, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after January 18, 2017.

(2) *Reporting relating to effectively connected income.* Paragraphs (b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(vii), and (d)(1) of this section apply to a contribution occurring on or after August 6, 2015, and to a contribution occurring before August 6, 2015, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after August 6, 2015, and, in either case, provided § 1.721(c)-3T(b)(1)(ii) applies to the contribution. To the extent that a previously filed return did not comply with paragraph (b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(vii), or (d)(1) of this section, an amended return complying with such paragraphs must be filed no later than six months after January 18, 2017.

(3) *Transition rules.* For transfers occurring on or after August 6, 2015, and for transfers occurring before August 6, 2015, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 of this chapter that is filed on or after August 6, a U.S. transferor (or a domestic partnership in which a U.S. transferor is a direct or indirect partner) must fulfill any reporting requirements imposed under sections 6038, 6038B, and 6046A and the regulations thereunder with respect to the contribution of the section 721(c) property to the section 721(c) partnership.

(h) *Expiration date.* The applicability of this section expires on January 17, 2020.
