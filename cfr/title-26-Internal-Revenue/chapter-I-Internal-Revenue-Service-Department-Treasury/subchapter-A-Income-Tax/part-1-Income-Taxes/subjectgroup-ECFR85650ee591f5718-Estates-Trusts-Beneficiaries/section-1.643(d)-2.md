##### § 1.643(d)-2 Illustration of the provisions of section 643. #####

(a) The provisions of section 643 may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.(1) Under the terms of the trust instrument, the income of a trust is required to be currently distributed to W during her life. Capital gains are allocable to corpus and all expenses are charges against corpus. During the taxable year the trust has the following items of income and expenses:

|                  Dividends from domestic corporations                  |$30,000|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
|Extraordinary dividends allocated to corpus by the trustee in good faith|20,000 |
|                            Taxable interest                            |10,000 |
|                          Tax-exempt interest                           |10,000 |
|                        Long-term capital gains                         |10,000 |
|  Trustee's commissions and miscellaneous expenses allocable to corpus  | 5,000 |

(2) The “income” of the trust determined under section 643(b) which is currently distributable to W is $50,000, consisting of dividends of $30,000, taxable interest of $10,000, and tax-exempt interest of $10,000. The trustee's commissions and miscellaneous expenses allocable to tax-exempt interest amount to $1,000 (10,000/50,000 × $5,000).

(3) The “distributable net income” determined under section 643(a) amounts to $45,000, computed as follows:

|                Dividends from domestic corporations                |$30,000|   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---|
|                          Taxable interest                          |10,000 |   |
|                        Nontaxable interest                         |$10,000|   |
|                  Less: Expenses allocable thereto                  | 1,000 |   |
|                                                                    | 9,000 |   |
|                               Total                                |49,000 |   |
|Less: Expenses ($5,000 less $1,000 allocable to tax-exempt interest)| 4,000 |   |
|                      Distributable net income                      |45,000 |   |

In determining the distributable net income of $45,000, the taxable income of the trust is computed with the following modifications: No deductions are allowed for distributions to W and for personal exemption of the trust (section 643(a) (1) and (2)); capital gains allocable to corpus are excluded and the deduction allowable under section 1202 is not taken into account (section 643(a)(3)): the extraordinary dividends allocated to corpus by the trustee in good faith are excluded (sections 643(a)(4)); and the tax- exempt interest (as adjusted for expenses) and the dividend exclusion of $50 are included) section 643(a) (5) and (7)).

(b) See paragraph (c) of the example in § 1.661(c)-2 for the computation of distributable net income where there is a charitable contributions deduction.
