##### § 1.362-4 Basis of loss duplication property. #####

(a) *Purpose and scope* - (1) *In general.* The purpose of section 362(e)(2) and this section is to prevent the duplication of net loss in transfers to which section 351 applies, capital contributions, and paid-in surplus (each, a section 362(a) transaction). See paragraph (g) of this section for definitions of terms used in this section.

(2) *Intercompany transactions.* For rules relating to the application of section 362(e)(2) to transfers between members of a consolidated group on or after October 22, 2004, see § 1.1502-80(h).

(b) *Basis determinations under section 362(e)(2) and this section.* Notwithstanding section 362(a), if a corporation (Acquiring) receives loss duplication property (as defined in paragraph (g)(1) of this section) from a person (Transferor) in a loss duplication transaction (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section), Acquiring's basis in such property is equal to the basis of the property determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section (as described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section), reduced by the property's allocable portion of Transferor's net built-in loss (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section). If more than one Transferor transfers property to a corporation in a section 362(a) transaction, whether and the extent to which section 362(e)(2) and this section apply is determined separately for each Transferor.

(c) *Exceptions and special rules* - (1) *Transactions in which net built-in loss is eliminated without recognition.* Section 362(e)(2) does not apply to a transaction to the extent that -

(i) Without recognizing gain or loss, Transferor distributes the Acquiring stock received in the transaction; and

(ii) Upon completion of the transaction, no person holds Acquiring stock or any other asset with a basis determined, in whole or in part, by reference to Transferor's basis in the distributed Acquiring stock.

(2) *Certain transactions outside of the United States.* Section 362(e)(2) does not apply to a transaction if -

(i) Neither Transferor nor Acquiring is a U.S. person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)), a person otherwise required to file a U.S. return for the year of the transaction, a controlled foreign corporation (CFC, as defined in paragraph (g)(7) of this section), or a controlled foreign partnership (CFP, as defined in paragraph (g)(9) of this section) on the date of the transaction;

(ii) The transfer occurs more than two years prior to the date of any event described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E), (F), or (G) of this section; and

(iii) The original transaction and the event or events described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E), (F), or (G) of this section were not entered into with a view to reducing or avoiding the Federal income tax liability of any person by avoiding the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section to the original transaction.

(3) *Other effects of basis determination under this section* - (i) *Determination by reference to transferor's basis.* A determination of basis under this section is a determination by reference to the transferor's basis, including for purposes of sections 755, 1223(2), and 7701(a)(43).

(ii) *Treatment as tax-exempt income or noncapital, nondeductible expense.* A determination of basis under paragraph (b) of this section does not give rise to an item treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii). However, a determination of basis under paragraph (d) of this section does give rise to an item treated as a noncapital, nondeductible expense under § 1.1502-32(b)(2)(iii).

(d) *Election to reduce Transferor's stock basis instead of Acquiring's asset basis* - (1) *In general.* In lieu of making the basis reductions otherwise required under paragraph (b) of this section, Transferor and Acquiring may elect to reduce Transferor's basis in Acquiring stock that is received in the transaction without the recognition of gain or loss (the section 362(e)(2)(C) election). The section 362(e)(2)(C) election may be made protectively and will have no effect to the extent that property transferred in the transaction is determined not to be subject to section 362(e)(2) and this section. However, the election is irrevocable once it is made. A section 362(e)(2)(C) election is made and effective if -

(i) Prior to the filing of a Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement (described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section), Transferor and Acquiring enter into a written, binding agreement to elect to apply section 362(e)(2)(C); and

(ii) The Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement is filed in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

(2) *Effect of section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* If a section 362(e)(2)(C) election is made and in effect -

(i) An amount equal to the portion of Transferor's net built-in loss (as defined in paragraph (g)(3) of this section) that would otherwise be applied to reduce asset basis under paragraph (b) of this section is allocated among the Acquiring shares received or deemed received in the exchange (in proportion to the value of such shares) and applied to reduce Transferor's basis (determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section) in each such share; and

(ii) Acquiring's basis in loss duplication property received from Transferor in the transaction is not determined under section 362(e)(2) and this section.

(3) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement* - (i) *Form and contents of statement.* The Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement is to be titled “Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement.” The Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement must -

(A) Identify (by name and tax identification number, if any) Transferor and Acquiring;

(B) State that Transferor and Acquiring have entered into a written, binding agreement to elect to apply section 362(e)(2)(C) as required in paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section; and

(C) State the date of the transaction (or, if the transaction includes transfers on more than one date, then the dates of all transfers) to which the election applies.

(ii) *Filing the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement.* In general, the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement is filed by the person or entity described in the applicable paragraph of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii). Thus, if Transferor is a partnership, S corporation, trust (including a subpart E trust), or other pass-through entity, or Acquiring is an S corporation, the entity (and not the partners, shareholders, or other persons having an interest in the entity or its property) is the person that must file the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement, without regard to whether such entity is foreign or domestic. However, in the case of a CFC or CFP, the controlling U.S. shareholders of the CFC or the reporting U.S. partners of the CFP, respectively, file the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement.

(A) *Transferor is a person required to file a U.S. return.* If Transferor is a person required to file a U.S. return for the year of the transfer, Transferor must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement on or with its timely filed (including extensions) original U.S. return for the taxable year in which the transfer occurred.

(B) *Transferor is a CFC or CFP and not required to file a U.S. return.* If paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(A) of this section does not apply and Transferor is either a CFC or a CFP on the date of the transfer, all of Transferor's controlling U.S. shareholders (in the case of a CFC) or all of Transferor's reporting U.S. partners (in the case of a CFP) must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement on or with their timely filed (including extensions) original U.S. returns for their taxable years in which the transfer occurred.

(C) *Transferor is not a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP, but Acquiring is required to file U.S. return.* If paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section do not apply and Acquiring is a person required to file a U.S. return for the year of the transfer, Acquiring must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement on or with its timely filed (including extensions) original U.S. return for the taxable year in which the transfer occurred.

(D) *Transferor is not a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP, Acquiring is not required to file a U.S. return, but Acquiring is a CFC.* If paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section do not apply and Acquiring is a CFC on the date of the transfer, all of Acquiring's controlling U.S. shareholders must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement on or with their timely filed (including extensions) original U.S. returns for their taxable years in which the transfer occurred.

(E) *Neither Transferor nor Acquiring is a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP, but Transferor later becomes a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP.* If paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section do not apply and Transferor becomes a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP, Transferor (if required to file a U.S. return), all of Transferor's controlling U.S. shareholders (if Transferor becomes a CFC not otherwise required to file a U.S. return), or all of Transferor's reporting U.S. partners (if Transferor becomes a CFP not otherwise required to file a U.S. return) must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement on or with their timely filed (including extensions) original U.S. returns for their taxable years in which an event described in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E) first occurs. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E), the term Transferor includes any person holding property with a basis determined directly or indirectly by reference to Transferor's basis in the Acquiring stock received in the transaction.

(F) *Transferor is not and does not become a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP, Acquiring is not, but later becomes either a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP.* If paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) through (E) of this section do not apply and Acquiring becomes a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP, Acquiring (if required to file a U.S. return), all of Acquiring's controlling U.S. shareholders (if Acquiring becomes a CFC not otherwise required to file a U.S. return), or all of Acquiring's reporting U.S. partners (if Acquiring becomes a CFP not otherwise required to file a U.S. return) must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement on or with their timely filed (including extensions) original U.S. returns for their taxable years in which an event described in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) first occurs. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F), the term Acquiring includes any person holding property with a basis determined directly or indirectly by reference to Acquiring's basis in loss duplication property received in the transaction.

(G) *Transferor and Acquiring are not and do not become a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP, but the basis of the loss duplication property or Acquiring stock later becomes relevant for Federal tax purposes.* If paragraphs (d)(3)(ii)(A) through (F) of this section do not apply and, in a transferred basis transaction, a person required to file a U.S. return, a CFC, or a CFP acquires either loss duplication property or Acquiring stock that was received in the loss duplication transaction, or any property the basis of which is determined in whole or in part by reference to any such property or stock, all such persons (or, in the case of a CFC or CFP not required to file a U.S. return, all the controlling U.S. shareholders or all the reporting U.S. partners, as applicable) must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement on or with their timely filed (including extensions) original U.S. returns for their first taxable year(s) in which there occurs an event or events described in this paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(G).

(e) *Transfers by partnerships and S corporations* - (1) *Transfers by partnerships.* If a partnership transfers property in a loss duplication transaction with respect to which a section 362(e)(2)(C) election is made, the resulting reduction to the partnership's basis in the Acquiring stock received in exchange for the loss duplication property is treated as an expenditure of the partnership described in section 705(a)(2)(B).

(2) *Transfers by S corporations.* If an S corporation transfers property in a loss duplication transaction with respect to which a section 362(e)(2)(C) election is made, the resulting reduction to the S corporation's basis in the Acquiring stock received in exchange for the loss duplication property is treated as an expense of the S corporation described in section 1367(a)(2)(D).

(f) *Transfers to S corporations.* If a person transfers property to an S corporation in a loss duplication transaction, any resulting reduction under section 362(e)(2) and this section to the S corporation's basis in the property received is not treated as an expense of the S corporation described in section 1367(a)(2)(D).

(g) *Definitions.* For purposes of section 362(e)(2) and this section -

(1) *Loss duplication property* is any property -

(i) That is transferred by Transferor to Acquiring in a loss duplication transaction (as defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section); and

(ii) That Acquiring would take with a basis in excess of value immediately after the transaction; for this purpose, the basis Acquiring would take in the property is determined immediately after the transaction and without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section, but otherwise taking into account all applicable provisions of law, including, without limitation, section 362(e)(1).

(2) A *loss duplication transaction* is a section 362(a) transaction in which Acquiring's aggregate basis in the property received from Transferor would, but for section 362(e)(2) and this section, exceed the aggregate value of such property immediately after the transaction. For this purpose -

(i) A transaction is a section 362(a) transaction if it is described in section 362(a) without regard to whether it is also described in any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), including, without limitation, section 362(b); and

(ii) Acquiring's aggregate basis in the property received from Transferor is determined immediately after the transaction and without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section, but otherwise taking into account all applicable provisions of law, including, without limitation, section 362(e)(1).

(3) *Transferor's net built-in loss* is the excess of -

(i) Acquiring's aggregate basis (determined under paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section) in all property received from Transferor in a loss duplication transaction, over

(ii) The aggregate value of such property immediately after the transaction.

(4) A property's *built-in loss* is the excess of Acquiring's basis in the property (determined as described in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section) over the property's value (determined immediately after the transaction).

(5) A property's *allocable portion of Transferor's net built-in loss* is the portion of Transferor's net built-in loss that bears the same ratio to Transferor's net built-in loss that the property's built-in loss bears to the aggregate built-in losses reflected in the bases of loss duplication property transferred by Transferor in the transaction.

(6) A *U.S. return* is a return of income under section 6012 or an information return under Subtitle F, Chapter 61, Subchapter A, Part III of the Code (sections 6031 and following) or the regulations thereunder, that the taxpayer is unconditionally required to file. Thus, the term does not include elective forms or statements that are required to be filed only to obtain a particular tax treatment, including forms filed to make an election or to reduce or avoid withholding by a person not otherwise required to file a U.S. return (as described in this paragraph (g)(6)) (for example, a notice of nonrecognition under § 1.1445-2(d)).

(7) A *controlled foreign corporation* (CFC) is any corporation described in section 957 or section 953(c).

(8) A *controlling U.S. shareholder* is any person that is treated as a controlling U.S. shareholder under § 1.964-1(c)(5) because such person either owns a direct interest in the CFC or is treated as owning an interest in the CFC by reason of section 318(a)(2) (attribution from partnerships, estates, trusts, and corporations).

(9) A *controlled foreign partnership* (CFP) is any partnership treated as a controlled foreign partnership for purposes of section 6038.

(10) A *reporting U.S. partner* is any partner of a CFP that is required to file an information return with respect to the CFP pursuant to section 6038 or the regulations thereunder, without regard to § 1.6038-3(c) or (j). In addition, in applying the constructive ownership rules of § 1.6038-3(b)(4), the term “nonresident alien” is replaced by the term “individual.”

(11) The term *stock* means both Acquiring stock and Acquiring securities received by Transferor in the transaction if gain or loss on the receipt of the stock or securities is not recognized in whole or in part.

(12) *Value* - (i) *General rule.* The term *value* means fair market value.

(ii) *Special rule for transfers of partnership interests.* Notwithstanding the general rule in paragraph (g)(12)(i) of this section, when referring to a partnership interest, for purposes of section 362(e)(2) and this section, the term *value* means the sum of the cash that Acquiring would receive for the interest, assuming an exchange between a willing buyer and a willing seller (neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts), increased by any § 1.752-1 liabilities (as defined in § 1.752-1(a)(4)) of the partnership allocated to Acquiring with regard to such transferred interest under section 752 immediately after the transfer to Acquiring. See § 1.743-1 regarding the application of section 743(b) following a section 362(e) basis reduction.

(h) *Examples.* The examples in this paragraph (h) illustrate the application of section 362(e)(2) and the provisions of this section. Unless the facts otherwise indicate, the examples use the following nomenclature and assumptions: X, Y, P, S, S1, and S2 are domestic corporations; A and B are U.S. individuals; FC1 and FC2 are foreign corporations and are not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, have no U.S. real property interests, and have no other relationships, activities, or interests that would cause them, their shareholders, or their property to be subject to tax imposed under any provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (federal income tax); there is no applicable income tax treaty; PRS is a domestic partnership; no election is made under section 362(e)(2)(C); and the transferred property is not importation property (as defined in § 1.362-3(c)(2)) and the transfers are not loss importation transactions (as defined in § 1.362-3(c)(3)), so that the basis of no property is determined under section 362(e)(1). All persons and transactions are unrelated unless the facts indicate otherwise, all taxpayers are on a calendar tax year, and all other relevant facts are set forth in the examples. See § 1.362-3(f) for additional examples illustrating the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section, including to transactions that are subject to section 362(e)(2), and section 362(e)(1).

Example 1. Transfer described in section 351.(i) *Basic application of section.* (A) *Facts.* A owns Asset 1 (basis $90, value $60) and Asset 2 (basis $110, value $120). In a transaction to which section 351 applies, A transfers Asset 1 and Asset 2 to X in exchange for a single outstanding share of X stock representing all the outstanding X stock immediately after the transaction.

(B) *Analysis* - (*1*) *Loss duplication transaction.* A's transfer of Asset 1 and Asset 2 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's aggregate basis in those assets would be $200 ($90 + $110), which would exceed the aggregate value of the assets $180 ($60 + $120) immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and A has a net built-in loss of $20 ($200−$180).

(*2*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $90, which would exceed Asset 1's $60 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 2 would be $110, which would not exceed Asset 2's $120 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 2 is not loss duplication property.

(C) *Basis in loss duplication property.* X's basis in Asset 1 is $70, computed as its $90 basis under section 362(a) reduced by A's $20 net built-in loss.

(D) *Basis in other property.* Under section 362(a), X has a transferred basis of $110 in Asset 2. Under section 358(a), A has an exchanged basis of $200 in the X stock it receives in the transaction.

(ii) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this *Example 1,* except that A and X make an election under section 362(e)(2)(C). Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, A reduces its basis in the X stock, as determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section, by the amount of A's net built-in loss that would have been applied to reduce X's basis in Asset 1 had the section 362(e)(2)(C) election not been made. In addition, no reduction is made to X's basis in Asset 1, as determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section. As a result, A's basis in the X stock is $180 ($200−$20), X's basis in Asset 1 is $90, and X's basis in Asset 2 is $110.

Example 2. Transfer described in both section 351 and section 368(a)(1)(B).(i) *Basic application of section* - (A) *Facts.* P owns the sole outstanding share of S1 stock and the ten outstanding shares of S2 stock. In a transaction to which section 351 applies and that is described in section 368(a)(1)(B), P transfers its ten S2 shares to S1 in exchange for an additional ten shares of S1 voting stock. At the time of the transfer, P has a basis of $10 each in five of its S2 shares (Shares 1-5) and a basis of $5 each in its other five S2 shares (Shares 6-10), and the value of each share is $7.

(B) *Analysis* - (*1*) *Loss duplication transaction.* P's transfer of the S2 shares is a section 362(a) transaction notwithstanding that it is also a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(B) and therefore section 362(b). But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S1's aggregate basis in the S2 shares would be $75 ($10 × 5, or $50, for Shares 1-5 + $5 × 5, or $25, for Shares 6-10). Thus, S1's $75 aggregate basis in the shares would exceed the aggregate value of the shares, $70 ($7 × 10 shares), immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and P has a net built-in loss of $5 ($75−$70).

(*2*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S1's basis in each of Shares 1-5 would be $10, which would exceed each share's $7 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Shares 1-5 are each loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S1's basis in each of Shares 6-10 would be $5, which would not exceed each share's $7 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Shares 6-10 are not loss duplication property.

(C) *Basis in loss duplication property.* S1's basis in each of Shares 1-5 is $9, computed as its $10 basis (determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section) reduced by $1, the share's allocable portion (1/5) of P's net built-in loss ($5).

(D) *Basis in other property.* Under section 362(a), S1 has a transferred basis of $5 in each of Shares 6-10. Under section 358(a), P has an exchanged basis in the ten S1 shares it receives in the exchange ($10 in each of the five S1 shares received in exchange for Shares 1-5 and $5 in each of the five S1 shares received in exchange for Shares 5-10).

(ii) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this *Example 2,* except that an election under section 362(e)(2)(C) is made to reduce P's basis in the shares of S1 stock received in the exchange. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, P reduces its basis in the S1 stock by $5, the amount of P's net built-in loss that S1's basis in the S2 shares would have been reduced under section 362(e)(2) and this section had the section 362(e)(2)(C) election not been made, and no reduction is made to S1's basis in the S2 stock (as determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section). Because an election is being made under section 362(e)(2)(C), P's basis in the new S1 shares is not determined under the general rule of § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i) (under which P's basis in each new S1 share would be equal to the basis of the S2 share transferred in exchange for the S1 share). Section 1.358-2(a)(2)(viii)(B). Accordingly, P's basis in each new S1 share will be $7, the share's allocable portion of P's $75 aggregate basis in the S2 shares transferred in the transaction (or, $7.50 per share), reduced under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section by the $5 that would have been applied to reduce S1's basis in the S2 shares had the section 362(e)(2)(C) election not been made (or $.50 per share). Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section and section 362(a), S1 receives five shares of the S2 stock with a basis of $10 each and five shares of the S2 stock with a basis of $5 each.

Example 3. Transfer described in both section 351 and section 368(a)(1)(A), multiple transferors, elimination of duplicated loss.(i) *Facts.* A owns Asset 1 (basis $120, value $130) and all the outstanding shares of X stock. B owns all the outstanding shares of Y stock (basis $150). Y owns Asset 2 (basis $250, value $210). Pursuant to a single plan, A transfers Asset 1 to X in exchange for additional X shares and, in a transaction qualifying as a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A), Y merges with and into X. In the merger, B receives X stock with a basis equal to B's basis in its Y stock immediately before the merger. A's transfer of Asset 1 to X in exchange for X stock and Y's transfer of Asset 2 to X in the merger are both transactions to which section 351 applies. Notwithstanding that the transfers by A and Y are pursuant to a single plan forming one transaction, section 362(e)(2) and this section apply to each transferor separately.

(ii) *Application of section to A's transfer of Asset 1.* A's transfer of Asset 1 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $120, which would not exceed Asset 1's $130 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, A's transfer of Asset 1 is not a loss duplication transaction notwithstanding that, taking both A's transfer and Y's transfer into account, X has an aggregate net loss in Asset 1 and Asset 2. Because Asset 1 is not received in a loss duplication transaction, it is not loss duplication property and section 362(e)(2) and this section do not apply to A's transfer of Asset 1.

(iii) *Application of section to Y's transfer of Asset 2* - (A) *Analysis* - (*1*) *Loss duplication transaction.* Y's transfer of Asset 2 to X is a section 362(a) transaction, notwithstanding that it is also a transaction described in section 368(a)(1)(A) and therefore section 362(b). But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 2 would be $250, which would exceed Asset 2's $210 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Y's transfer is a loss duplication transaction and Y has a net built-in loss of $40.

(*2*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 2 would be $250, which would exceed Asset 2's $210 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 2 is loss duplication property.

(B) *Basis in loss duplication property.* Although Asset 2 is loss duplication property, section 362(e)(2) does not apply to Y's transfer of Asset 2 to X because Y distributes all of the X stock received in the exchange without recognizing gain or loss, and, upon completion of the transaction, no person will hold the X stock or any other asset with a basis determined in whole or in part by reference to Y's basis in such stock. Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, X's basis in Asset 2 is not determined under section 362(e)(2) and this section. Thus, under section 362(a), X's basis in Asset 2 is $250.

(iv) *Basis in other property.* Under section 358, A's basis in the X stock received in exchange for Asset 1 is $120 and B's basis in the X stock received in the merger is $150. Under section 362(a), X's basis in Asset 1 is $120.

Example 4. Transfer described in both section 351 and section 368(a)(1)(D), followed by a distribution qualifying under section 355.(i) *Basic transaction* - (A) *Facts.* A and B each own one of the two outstanding shares of X common stock. X's assets include Asset 1 (basis $120, value $70), Asset 2 (basis $160, value $110), and Asset 3 (basis $220, value $240). In a transaction to which section 351 applies and that is described in section 368(a)(1)(D), X transfers Asset 1, Asset 2, and Asset 3 to Y in exchange for all the Y stock; then, in a distribution that qualifies under section 355, X distributes all the Y stock received in the exchange to A in exchange for all of A's X stock. Under section 361(c)(1), X does not recognize gain or loss as a result of the distribution of all the Y stock.

(B) *Analysis* - (*1*) *Loss duplication transaction.* X's transfer of Asset 1, Asset 2, and Asset 3 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, Y's aggregate basis in those assets would be $500 ($120 + $160 + $220). The aggregate value of the assets immediately after the transaction is $420 ($70 + $110 + $240). Thus, Y's aggregate basis in the assets would exceed the aggregate value of the assets immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and X has a net built-in loss of $80 ($500 − $420).

(*2*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, Y's basis in Asset 1 would be $120, which would exceed Asset 1's $70 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, Y's basis in Asset 2 would be $160, which would exceed Asset 2's $110 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 2 is also loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, Y's basis in Asset 3 would be $220 and would therefore not exceed Asset 3's $240 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 3 is not loss duplication property.

(C) *Basis in loss duplication property.* Although Asset 1 and Asset 2 are each loss duplication property, X will distribute the Y stock received in exchange for Asset 1 and Asset 2 without recognition of gain or loss, and, upon completion of the transaction, no person will hold the Y stock received by X or any other asset with a basis determined in whole or in part by reference to X's basis in the Y stock received in the exchange. (A's basis in the Y stock will be determined by reference to his basis in his X stock.) Accordingly, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Y's bases in Asset 1 and Asset 2 are determined under section 362(a) and not under section 362(e)(2) and this section. Thus, Y's basis in Asset 1 is $120 and Y's basis in Asset 2 is $160.

(D) *Basis in other property.* Under section 358, A's basis in the Y stock received in exchange for his X stock is determined by reference to his basis in his X stock surrendered. Under section 362(a), Y's basis in Asset 3 is $220.

(ii) *Section 355(e)* - (A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this *Example 4,* except that, after the section 355 distribution, Y is acquired pursuant to a plan (within the meaning of § 1.355-7), resulting in the application of section 355(e) to the transactions.

(B) *Analysis.* Because section 361(c)(2), and not section 361(c)(1), will apply to X's distribution of Y stock, X will not qualify for nonrecognition treatment on the distribution of the Y stock. As a result, paragraph (c)(1) of this section does not apply to the transaction, and Y's bases in Asset 1 and Asset 2, the loss duplication property, are determined under section 362(e)(2) and this section. Asset 1 has a built-in loss of $50 ($120 − $70), and Asset 2 has a built-in loss of $50 ($160 − $110). Thus, Asset 1's allocable portion of X's net built-in loss is $40 ($50/$100 × $80), and Asset 2's allocable portion of X's net built-in loss is $40 ($50/$100 × $80). Accordingly, Y receives Asset 1 with a basis of $80 ($120 − $40) and Asset 2 with a basis of $120 ($160 − $40).

(iii) *Retained stock and securities* - (A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this *Example 4,* except that X transfers Asset 1, Asset 2, and Asset 3 to Y in exchange for Y stock and Y securities, each constituting half of the consideration. In addition, for a valid business purpose, X retains Y stock and Y securities each worth 1 percent of the total consideration.

(B) *Analysis.* Paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies only to the extent that stock received in a transaction is distributed without recognition of gain or loss. Thus, section 362(e)(2) and this section apply to the extent that property was exchanged for the retained Y stock and Y securities (2 percent of the total). Accordingly, Y reduces its basis in Asset 1 and in Asset 2, the loss duplication property, by $1.60 (two percent of X's $80 net built-in loss). Asset 1 has a built-in loss of $50 ($120 − $70), and Asset 2 has a built-in loss of $50 ($160 − $110). Thus, Asset 1's allocable portion of X's net built-in loss is $.80 ($50/$100 × $1.60), and Asset 2's allocable portion of X's net built-in loss is $.80 ($50/$100 × $1.60). As a result, Y receives Asset 1 with a basis of $119.20 ($120 − $.80) and Asset 2 with a basis of $159.20 ($160 − $.80).

(iv) *Retained stock and securities with a section 362(e)(2)(C) election* - (A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (iii)(A) of this *Example 4,* except that an election under section 362(e)(2)(C) is made to reduce X's bases in its retained Y stock and retained Y securities.

(B) *Analysis.* Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, X reduces its basis in the retained Y stock and the retained Y securities (determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section) by $1.60, the portion of X's $80 net built-in loss that would have been applied to reduce Y's basis in the transferred assets had the election to apply section 362(e)(2)(C) not been made. (Because the value of the Y stock and the value of the Y securities are equal, X's $500 basis in the transferred property would be allocated equally between the Y stock and the Y securities, $250 to each, under § 1.358-2(b)(2), and the retained Y stock and Y securities have a basis of $2.50 each (one percent of $250).) For the reasons set forth in paragraph (iii)(B) of this *Example 4,* Y would have been required to reduce its basis in the transferred assets by $1.60. Accordingly, X must reduce its aggregate basis in the retained Y stock and Y securities by $1.60. Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, the $1.60 basis reduction is allocated and applied to reduce X's bases in the retained Y stock and Y securities in proportion to the value of each. Because X retained Y stock and Y securities with equal values, X holds each of the retained Y stock and securities with an adjusted basis of $1.70 ($2.50 − $.80). Under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, Y receives Asset 1 with a basis of $120, Asset 2 with a basis of $160, and Asset 3 with a basis of $220.

Example 5. Transfer of liabilities.(i) *Liabilities described in section 358(d)(1)* - (A) *Basic application of section, no section 362(e)(2)(C) election* - (*1*) *Facts.* A owns Asset 1 (basis $800, value $700). A also has a $200 liability that has been taken into account for tax purposes and is thus described in section 358(d)(1), and not in sections 357(c)(3), 358(d)(2), and 358(h)(1). A transfers Asset 1 to X in exchange for a single outstanding share of X stock representing all the outstanding X stock immediately after the transaction and X's assumption of the liability. The transfer is a transaction to which section 351 applies.

(*2*) *Analysis* - (*i*) *Loss duplication transaction.* A's transfer of Asset 1 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $800, which would exceed Asset 1's $700 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and A has a net built-in loss of $100 ($800 − $700).

(*ii*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $800, which would exceed the $700 value of Asset 1 immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is loss duplication property.

(*3*) *Basis in loss duplication property.* X's basis in Asset 1 is $700, computed as its $800 basis determined under section 362(a) reduced by A's $100 net built-in loss.

(*4*) *Basis in other property.* Under sections 358(a) and (d)(1), A's basis in the X stock is $600 ($800 basis in property transferred - $200 liability assumed).

(B) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A)(*1*) of this *Example 5,* except that A and X make an election under section 362(e)(2)(C). In this case, A's $100 net built-in loss that would have been applied to reduce X's basis in Asset 1 is applied to reduce A's basis in the X stock received. As a result, A's basis in the X stock is $500 ($600, as determined in paragraph (i)(A)(*4*) of this *Example 5,* reduced by $100) and X's basis in Asset 1 is $800.

(ii) *Contingent liabilities described in section 358(h)(1), section 358(h)(2)(A) exception applies* - (A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A)(*1*) of this *Example 5,* except that A's liability (valued at $200) has not been taken into account for tax purposes and is described in sections 358(d)(2) and 358(h)(1). However, Asset 1 is a trade or business and the liability is associated with the trade or business; as a result, the liability is described in section 358(h)(2)(A) and is excepted from the general rule of section 358(h)(1).

(B) *Analysis.* For the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(A)(*2*) of this *Example 5,* A's transfer of Asset 1 is a loss duplication transaction, A has a net built-in loss of $100, and Asset 1 is loss duplication property.

(C) *Basis in loss duplication property.* For the reasons set forth in paragraph (i)(A)(*3*) of this *Example 5,* X's basis in Asset 1 is $700.

(D) *Basis in other property.* A's basis in the X stock is $800 under sections 358(a), 358(d)(2), and 358(h)(2)(A).

(E) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii)(A) of this *Example 5,* except that A and X make an election under section 362(e)(2)(C). In this case, A's $100 net built-in loss that would have applied to reduce X's basis in Asset 1 is applied to reduce A's basis in the X stock received. As a result, A's basis in the X stock is $700 ($800, as determined in paragraph (ii)(D) of this *Example 5,* reduced by $100). X's basis in Asset 1 is $800.

Example 6. Section 351 transfer with boot.(i) *Basic transaction*-(A) *Facts.* A owns Asset 1 (basis $80, value $100) and Asset 2 (basis $30, value $25). In a transaction to which section 351 applies, A transfers Asset 1 and Asset 2 to X in exchange for 10 shares of X stock and $25.

(B) *Analysis* - (*1*) *Loss duplication transaction.* A's transfer of Asset 1 and Asset 2 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's aggregate basis in those assets would be $130, computed as follows. Under section 362(a), a corporation's basis in property acquired in a transaction to which section 351 applies is the same as the property's basis in the hands of the transferor, increased by any gain recognized to the transferor on such transfer. Under section 351(b), gain (but not loss) is recognized to the extent a transferor in a section 351 exchange receives other property or money in addition to the stock permitted to be received without the recognition of gain. To determine the amount of gain recognized under section 351(b), the consideration is allocated proportionately (by value) among the transferred properties. A's gain on the transfer is therefore computed as follows: Asset 1 reflects 80 percent of the value transferred ($100/$125) and Asset 2 reflects 20 percent of the value transferred ($25/$125). Thus, 80 percent of the stock (eight shares) and the cash ($20) are treated as being received in exchange for Asset 1 and 20 percent of the stock (two shares) and the cash ($5) are treated as being received in exchange for Asset 2. Thus, under section 351(b), A recognizes $20 of gain for the cash received in exchange for Asset 1, but A recognizes no loss for the amount received for Asset 2. As a result, under section 362(a), X would have a basis of $100 in Asset 1 and $30 in Asset 2. Thus, X's aggregate basis in the assets would be $130, which exceeds the $125 aggregate value of the assets ($100 + $25)). The transfer is a loss duplication transaction and A has a net built-in loss of $5 ($130−$125).

(*2*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $100 (A's $80 basis increased by A's $20 gain recognized), which would not exceed Asset 1's $100 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is not loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 2 would be $30, which would exceed Asset 2's $25 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 2 is loss duplication property.

(C) *Basis in loss duplication property.* X's basis in Asset 2 is $25, computed as its $30 basis under section 362(a) reduced by A's $5 net built-in loss.

(D) *Basis in other property.* Under section 362(a), X's basis in Asset 1 is $100 (A's $80 basis increased by the $20 gain recognized). Under section 358, A's basis in the X stock is $105 (the sum of its $80 basis in Asset 1, its $30 basis in Asset 2, and its $20 gain recognized, reduced by the $25 cash received in the exchange).

(ii) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this *Example 6,* except that A and X elect to reduce A's stock basis under section 362(e)(2)(C). Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, A reduces its $105 basis in the X stock by $5, the amount of A's net built-in loss of that would have been applied to reduce X's basis in Asset 2 had the section 362(e)(2)(C) election not been made. As a result, A's basis in the X stock is $100, and X's basis in Asset 2 is $30.

Example 7. Section 304 sale of built-in loss stock.(i) *Basic transaction* - (A) *Facts.* A owns all the stock of X (basis $90, value $60) and all the stock of Y. A sells all his X stock to Y for $60. Under section 304, A is treated as though he transferred the X stock to Y in exchange for Y stock in a transaction to which section 351 applies. Then, Y is treated as redeeming the Y stock it was treated as having issued to A in the deemed section 351 transaction.

(B) *Analysis* - (*1*) *Loss duplication transaction.* A's deemed transfer of X stock to Y is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, Y's aggregate basis in the X stock would be $90, which would exceed the X stock's value of $60 immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and A has a net built-in loss of $30.

(*2*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, Y's basis in the X stock would be $90, which would exceed the X stock's $60 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the X stock is loss duplication property.

(C) *Basis in loss duplication property.* Y's basis in the X stock is $60, its $90 basis determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section, reduced by A's $30 net built-in loss.

(D) *Basis in other property.* Under section 358(a), A has an exchanged basis of $90 in the Y stock he is deemed to receive in the exchange; the effect of the deemed redemption of that stock is then determined under section 302.

(ii) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this *Example 7,* except that the parties elect to reduce A's stock basis under section 362(e)(2)(C). For the reasons set forth in paragraphs (i)(B) and (C) of this *Example 7,* Y's basis in the X stock would be reduced by $30. Accordingly, A's basis in the deemed-issued Y stock is $60, his $90 basis otherwise determined under section 358(a) reduced by the $30 that would have been applied to reduce Y's basis in the X stock under section 362(e)(2) and this section; the effect of the deemed redemption of that stock is then determined under section 302. Y's basis in the X stock is $90.

Example 8. Transactions involving partnerships.(i) *Transfer by a partnership* - (A) *Basic application of section* - (*1*) *Facts.* PRS owns Asset 1 (basis $100, value $70). PRS contributes Asset 1 to X in a transaction to which section 351 applies.

(*2*) *Analysis* - (*i*) *Loss duplication transaction.* PRS's transfer of Asset 1 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $100, which would exceed Asset 1's $70 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and PRS has a net built-in loss of $30 ($100−$70).

(*ii*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $100, which would exceed Asset 1's $70 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is loss duplication property.

(*3*) *Basis in loss duplication property.* X's basis in Asset 1 is $70, computed as its $100 basis under section 362(a) reduced by PRS's $30 net built-in loss.

(*4*) *Basis in other property.* Under section 358(a), PRS has an exchanged basis of $100 in the X stock it receives in the exchange.

(B) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A)(*1*) of this *Example 8,* except that PRS and X elect to reduce PRS's stock basis under section 362(e)(2)(C). In this case, PRS's $30 net built-in loss (as determined in paragraph (i)(A)(*2*)(*i*) of this *Example 8*) that would have been applied to reduce X's basis in Asset 1 is applied to reduce PRS's basis in the X stock received. As a result, PRS's basis in the X stock is $70 ($100−$30) and X's basis in Asset 1 is $100. The $30 reduction to PRS's basis in the X stock is treated as an expenditure of PRS under section 705(a)(2)(B) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. As a result, the partners of PRS must reduce their bases in their PRS interests.

(ii) *Transfer of interest in partnership with liability* - (A) *Basic application of section* - (*1*) *Facts.* A and two other individuals are equal partners in PRS. A's basis in its partnership interest is $247. A's share of PRS's § 1.752-1 liabilities (as defined in § 1.752-1(a)(4)) is $145. A transfers his partnership interest to X in a transaction to which section 351 applies. PRS has no election in effect under section 754. If X were to sell the PRS interest immediately after the transfer, X would receive $100 in cash or other property. In addition, assume that, taking into account the rules under § 1.752-4, X's share of PRS's § 1.752-1 liabilities (as defined in § 1.752-1(a)(4)) is $150 immediately after the transfer.

(*2*) *Analysis* - (*i*) *Loss duplication transaction.* A's transfer of its PRS interest is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in the PRS interest, would be $252 (A's basis of $247, reduced by A's $145 share of PRS liabilities, increased by X's $150 share of PRS liabilities) and, under paragraph (g)(12)(ii) of this section, the value of the PRS interest would be $250 (the sum of $100, the cash X would receive if X immediately sold the interest, and $150, X's share of the § 1.752-1 liabilities (as defined in § 1.752-1(a)(4)) under section 752 immediately after the transfer to X). Therefore, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and A has a net built-in loss of $2 ($252−$250).

(*ii*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in the PRS interest would be $252, which would exceed the PRS interest's $250 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the PRS interest is loss duplication property.

(*3*) *Basis in loss duplication property.* X's basis in the PRS interest is $250, computed as its $252 basis under section 362(a), taking into account the rules under section 752, reduced by A's $2 net built-in loss.

(*4*) *Basis in other property.* Under section 358, taking into account the rules under section 752, A has a basis of $102 ($247 reduced by A's $145 share of PRS liabilities) in the X stock he receives in the transaction.

(B) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A) of this *Example 8,* except that A and X make an election under section 362(e)(2)(C). Under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, A reduces his basis in the X stock, as determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section, by the amount of A's net built-in loss that would have been applied to reduce X's basis in the PRS interest had the section 362(e)(2)(C) election not been made. In addition, no reduction is made to X's basis in the PRS interest, as determined without regard to section 362(e)(2) and this section. As a result, A's basis in the X stock is $100 ($102−$2) and X's basis in the PRS interest is $252.

(C) *Transfer of partnership interest with liability, not loss duplication transaction.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii)(A)(1) of this *Example 8,* except that A's share of PRS's § 1.752-1 liabilities (as defined in § 1.752-1(a)(4)) is $155. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in the PRS interest would be $242 (A's basis of $247, reduced by A's $155 share of PRS liabilities, increased by X's $150 share of PRS liabilities), which would not exceed the PRS interest's $250 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, A's transfer of the PRS interest is not a loss duplication transaction and section 362(e)(2) and this section have no application to the transaction. Under section 362(a), X's basis in the PRS interest is $242 and, under section 358, taking into account the rules under section 752, A has a basis of $92 ($247 reduced by A's $155 share of PRS liabilities) in the X stock he receives in the transaction.

Example 9. Transactions involving S Corporations.(i) *Transfer by S Corporation* - (A) *No section 362(e)(2)(C) election* - (*1*) *Facts.* S, an S corporation as defined in section 1361(a)(1), owns Asset 1 (basis $100, value $70). S transfers Asset 1 to X in exchange for a single outstanding share of X stock representing all the outstanding X stock immediately after the transaction. S does not elect to treat X as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary. The transaction is one to which section 351 applies.

(*2*) *Analysis* - (*i*) *Loss duplication transaction.* S's transfer of Asset 1 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $100, which would exceed Asset 1's $70 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and S has a net built-in loss of $30 ($100−$70).

(*ii*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, X's basis in Asset 1 would be $100, which would exceed Asset 1's $70 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is loss duplication property.

(*iii*) *Basis in loss duplication property.* X's basis in Asset 1 is $70, computed as its $100 basis under section 362(a) reduced by S's $30 net built-in loss.

(*iv*) *Basis in other property.* Under section 358(a), S has an exchanged basis of $100 in the X stock it receives in the exchange.

(B) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i)(A)(*1*) of this *Example 9,* except that S and X elect to reduce S's stock basis under section 362(e)(2). In this case, S's $30 built-in loss (as determined in paragraph (i)(A)(*2*)(*i*) of this *Example 9*) that would have been applied to reduce X's basis in Asset 1 is applied to reduce S's basis in the X stock received. As a result, S's basis in the X stock is $70 ($100 − $30) and X's basis in Asset 1 is $100. The $30 reduction to S's basis in the X stock is treated as an expense of S under section 1367(a)(2)(D) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section. As a result, the shareholders of S must reduce their bases in their S stock.

(ii) *Transfer to S Corporation* - (A) *Basic application of section.* (*1*) *Facts.* A owns Asset 1 (basis $90, value $60) and Asset 2 (basis $110, value $120). In a transaction to which section 351 applies, A transfers Asset 1 and Asset 2 to S, an S corporation as defined in section 1361(a)(1), in exchange for a single share of S stock representing all the outstanding S stock immediately after the transaction.

(*2*) *Analysis* - (*i*) *Loss duplication transaction.* A's transfer of Asset 1 and Asset 2 is a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S's aggregate basis in those assets would be $200 ($90 + $110), which would exceed the aggregate value of the assets $180 ($60 + $120) immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and A has a net built-in loss of $20 ($200 − $180).

(*ii*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S's basis in Asset 1 would be $90, which would exceed Asset 1's $60 value immediately after the transaction. As a result, Asset 1 is loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, S's basis in Asset 2 would be $110, which would not exceed Asset 2's $120 value immediately after the transaction. As a result, Asset 2 is not loss duplication property.

(*3*) *Basis in loss duplication property.* S's basis in Asset 1 is $70, computed as its $90 basis under section 362(a) reduced by S's $20 net built-in loss. The $20 reduction to S's basis in Asset 1 does not require a reduction to A's basis in its S stock under section 1367(a)(2)(D). See paragraph (f) of this section.

(*4*) *Basis in other property.* Under section 362(a), S has a transferred basis of $110 in Asset 2. Under section 358(a), A has a basis of $200 in the S stock it receives in the exchange.

(B) *Section 362(e)(2)(C) election* - (*1*) *Application of section to transaction.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii)(A)(*1*) of this *Example 9,* except that A and S elect to reduce A's stock basis under section 362(e)(2)(C). In this case, A's $20 built-in loss (as determined in paragraph (ii)(A)(*2*) of this *Example 9*) that would have been applied to reduce S's basis in Asset 1 is applied to reduce A's basis in the S stock received. As a result, A's basis in the S stock is $180 ($200 − $20), S's basis in Asset 1 is $90, and S's basis in Asset 2 is $110.

(*2*) *Tax consequences of subsequent disposition of transferred assets.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (ii)(B)(*1*) of this *Example 9* except that, in addition, the year after the transaction, S sells Asset 1 (basis $90, value $60) and Asset 2 (basis $110, value $120) for $180, recognizing the $20 net built-in loss. The loss is allocated to A and reduces A's basis in the S stock from $180 to $160 under section 1367(a)(2)(B). If A then sells its S stock for its $180 value, A will recognize a gain of $20.

Example 10. Triangular reorganizations.(i) *Facts.* P owns all the stock of S1 and X owns all the stock of S2. In a merger described in section 368(a)(2)(D), S2 merges with and into S1, and X receives stock of P in exchange for its S2 stock. S2 has a net built-in loss in its assets acquired by S1 in the transaction.

(ii) *Analysis.* The reorganization is not a section 362(a) transaction, notwithstanding that, under § 1.358-6(c), P is treated as acquiring and then transferring S2's assets to S1 for purposes of determining P's adjustment to its basis in its S1 stock. Accordingly, S1's basis in the property acquired in the transaction is not determined under section 362(e)(2) and this section; it is determined under section 362(b).

Example 11.*Transfers of importation property with non-importation property.* (*i*) *Single transferor, loss importation transaction.* (A) *Facts.* FC1 transfers Asset 1 (basis $80, value $50), Asset 2 (basis $120, value $110), and Asset 3 (basis $32, value $40) to DC in a transaction to which section 351 applies. Asset 1 is not importation property within the meaning of § 1.362-3(c)(2). Asset 2 and Asset 3 are importation property within the meaning of § 1.362-3(c)(2).

(B) *Application of section 362(e)(1).* Immediately after the transfer, and without regard to section 362(e)(1) or section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's aggregate basis in importation property (Asset 2 and Asset 3) would be $152. The aggregate value of the importation property immediately after the transfer is $150. Accordingly, the transaction is a loss importation transaction within the meaning of § 1.362-3(c)(3) and, under section 362(e)(1), DC's bases in Asset 2 and Asset 3 would equal the value of each, $110 and $40, respectively.

(C) *Application of section 362(e)(2) and this section.* (*1*) *Analysis.* (*i*) *Loss duplication transaction.* FC1's transfer of Asset 1, Asset 2, and Asset 3 is a transaction described in section 362(a). But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's aggregate basis in those assets would be $230 ($80 under section 362(a) + $110 + $40 under section 362(e)(1)), which would exceed the aggregate value of the assets $200 ($50 + $110 + 40) immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and FC1 has a net built-in loss of $30 ($230 − $200).

(*ii*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's basis in Asset 1 would be $80, which would exceed Asset 1's $50 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's basis in Asset 2 would be $110, which would not exceed Asset 2's $110 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 2 is not loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's basis in Asset 3 would be $40, which would not exceed Asset 3's $40 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 3 is not loss duplication property.

(D) *Basis in loss duplication property.* DC's basis in Asset 1 is $50, computed as its $80 basis under section 362(a) reduced by FC1's $30 net built-in loss.

(E) *Basis in other property.* Under section 362(e)(1), DC's basis in Asset 2 is $110 and DC's basis in Asset 3 is $40. Under section 358(a), FC1 has an exchanged basis of $232 in the DC stock it receives in the transaction.

(ii) *Multiple transferors, no importation of loss.* (A) *Facts.* The facts are the same as paragraph (i)(A) of this *Example 11,* except that, in addition, FC2 transfers Asset 4 (basis $100, value $150) to DC as part of the same transaction. Asset 4 is importation property within the meaning of § 1.362-3(c)(2).

(B) *Application of section 362(e)(1).* Immediately after the transfer, and without regard to section 362(e)(1) or section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's aggregate basis in importation property (Asset 2, Asset 3, and Asset 4) would be $252 ($120 + $32 + $100). The aggregate value of the importation property immediately after the transfer is $300 ($110 + $40 + $150). Accordingly, the transaction is not a loss importation transaction within the meaning of § 1.362-3(c)(3) and DC's bases in the importation property is not determined under section 362(e)(1).

(C) *Application of section 362(e)(2) and this section.* Notwithstanding that the transfers by FC1 and FC2 are pursuant to a single plan forming one transaction, section 362(e)(2) and this section apply to each transferor separately.

(*1*) *Application of section to FC1.* (*i*) *Loss duplication transaction.* FC1's transfer of Asset 1, Asset 2, and Asset 3 is a transaction described in section 362(a). But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's aggregate basis in those assets would be $232 ($80 + $120 + $32), which would exceed the aggregate value of the assets $200 ($50 + $110 + $40) immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transfer is a loss duplication transaction and FC1 has a net built-in loss of $32 ($232 − $200).

(*ii*) *Identifying loss duplication property.* But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's basis in Asset 1 would be $80, which would exceed Asset 1's $50 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 1 is loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's basis in Asset 2 would be $120, which would exceed Asset 2's $110 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 2 is also loss duplication property. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, DC's basis in Asset 3 would be $32, which would not exceed Asset 3's $40 value immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, Asset 3 is not loss duplication property.

(*iii*) *Basis in loss duplication property.* DC's basis in Asset 1 is $56, computed as its $80 basis under section 362(a) reduced by $24, its allocable portion of FC1's $32 net built-in loss ($30/40 × $32). DC's basis in Asset 2 is $112, computed as its $120 basis under section 362(a) reduced by $8, its allocable portion of FC1's $40 net built-in loss ($10/$40 × $32).

(*iv*) *Basis in other property.* Under section 358(a), FC1 has an exchanged basis of $232 in the DC stock it receives in the transaction.

(*2*) *Application of section to FC2.* FC2's transfer of Asset 3 is not a loss duplication transaction because Asset 3's value exceeds its basis immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, under section 362(a), DC's basis in Asset 3 is $100.

Example 12.*Section 362(e)(2)(C) elections with respect to transfers between persons that are not required to file a U.S. return and that are not CFCs or CFPs* - (i) *Basic application of section.* On June 30, Year 1, FC1 transfers Asset 1 to FC2 in a transaction to which section 351 applies (the original transfer) and that is therefore a section 362(a) transaction. But for section 362(e)(2) and this section, FC2's basis in Asset 1 (determined immediately after the transfer, taking into account all applicable law, including section 362(e)(1)) exceeds the value of Asset 1 immediately after the transaction. Accordingly, the transaction is a loss duplication transaction and Asset 1 is loss duplication property. FC1 and FC2 executed a written, binding agreement to apply section 362(e)(2)(C) at some point before any Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement is filed. However, the transfer was not entered into with a view to reducing or avoiding the Federal income tax liability of any person by avoiding the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section; further, no event described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E), (F), or (G) of this section occurs prior to June 30, Year 3. As a result, under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, section 362(e)(2) and this section do not apply to the transfer. Accordingly, FC2's basis in Asset 1 is determined under section 362(a), no section 362(e)(2)(C) election can be made, and any protective filing of a Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement will have no effect.

(ii) *Loss duplication property later acquired by a person required to file U.S. return.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this *Example 12,* except that, in addition, on January 1, Year 2, FC2 transfers Asset 1 to DC in an exchange to which section 351 applies. FC2's transfer is an event described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(G) of this section. As a result, paragraph (c)(2) does not except the original transfer from the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(G) of this section, DC must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement for the original transfer on or with its Year 2 U.S. return in order for that election to be effective. The result would be the same if, instead of FC2 transferring Asset 1 to DC, FC1 transferred its FC2 stock to DC in an exchange to which section 351 applies. (Further, if an asset transferred by FC1 or FC2 to DC is a loss asset immediately after its transfer to DC, DC's basis in that asset may be subject to section 362(e)(1).)

(iii) *Party to exchange later becomes a person required to file U.S. return.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this *Example 12,* except that, in addition, on January 1, Year 2, FC2 becomes engaged in a U.S. business. FC2's becoming engaged in a U.S. business is an event described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section because it will cause FC2 to become a person required to file a U.S. return. As a result, paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not except the transfer from the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, FC2 must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement for the original transfer on or with its Year 2 U.S. return in order for the section 362(e)(2)(C) election for the original transfer to be effective.

(iv) *Statement not filed with respect to designated event.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (iii) of this *Example 12,* except that, in addition, FC1 became engaged in a U.S. trade or business on October 31, Year 1 and as a result became a person required to file a U.S. return, an event described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E) of this section. As a result, paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not except the transfer from the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section. Further, in order for the election to be effective, FC1 must file the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement on or with its Year 1 U.S. return. See paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(E) of this section. A statement filed by FC2 on or with its Year 2 U.S. return has no effect. Thus, if FC1 does not file the statement, the election does not become effective and basis is determined under the general rule of section 362(e)(2).

(v) *Nonrecognition transfer of loss duplication property outside United States, transferee later becomes engaged in U.S. trade or business.* The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this *Example 12,* except that, in addition, on December 31, Year 1, FC2 transfers Asset 1 to FC3 in a transferred basis transaction. In Year 2, FC3 becomes engaged in a U.S. trade or business and as a result becomes a person required to file a U.S. return; Asset 1 is not used in or connected with the U.S. trade or business or otherwise subject to Federal income tax. FC3's becoming engaged in a U.S. trade or business is an event described in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section because FC3, a person who holds loss duplication property with a basis determined by FC2's basis in the property, will be required to file a U.S. return as a result of its becoming engaged in a U.S. business. As a result, paragraph (c)(2) of this section does not except the transfer from the application of section 362(e)(2) and this section. Under paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(F) of this section, FC3 must include the Section 362(e)(2)(C) Statement for the original transfer on or with its Year 2 U.S. return in order for the section 362(e)(2)(C) election for the original transfer to be effective.
