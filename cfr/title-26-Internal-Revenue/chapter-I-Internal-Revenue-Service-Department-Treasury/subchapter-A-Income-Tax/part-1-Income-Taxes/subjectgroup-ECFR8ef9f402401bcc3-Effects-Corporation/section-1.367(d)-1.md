##### § 1.367(d)-1 Transfers of intangible property to foreign corporations. #####

(a) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(d)-1T(a).

(b) *Property subject to section 367(d).* Section 367(d) and the rules of this section apply to the transfer of intangible property, as defined in § 1.367(a)-1(d)(5), by a U.S. person to a foreign corporation in an exchange described in section 351 or 361. See section 367(a) and the regulations thereunder for the rules that apply to the transfer of any property other than intangible property.

(c)(1) through (2) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(1) and (2).

(3) *Useful life*—(i) *In general.* For purposes of determining the period of inclusions for deemed payments under § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(1), the useful life of intangible property is the entire period during which exploitation of the intangible property is reasonably anticipated to affect the determination of taxable income, as of the time of transfer. Exploitation of intangible property includes any direct or indirect use or transfer of the intangible property, including use without further development, use in the further development of the intangible property itself (and any exploitation of the further developed intangible property), and use in the development of other intangible property (and any exploitation of the other developed intangible property).

(ii) *Procedure to limit inclusions to 20 years.* In cases where the useful life of the transferred property is indefinite or is reasonably anticipated to exceed twenty years, taxpayers may, in lieu of including amounts during the entire useful life of the intangible property, choose in the year of transfer to increase annual inclusions during the 20-year period beginning with the first year in which the U.S. transferor takes into account income pursuant to section 367(d), to reflect amounts that, but for this paragraph (c)(3)(ii), would have been required to be included following the end of the 20-year period. See § 1.6038B-1(d)(1)(iv) for guidance on reporting this choice of method. If the taxpayer applies this method during the 20-year period, no adjustments will be made for taxable years beginning after the conclusion of the 20-year period. However, for purposes of determining whether amounts included during the 20-year period are commensurate with the income attributable to the transferred intangible property, the Commissioner may take into account information with respect to taxable years after that period, such as the income attributable to the transferred property during those later years. The application of this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) must be reflected in a statement (titled “Application of 20-Year Inclusion Period to Section 367(d) Transfers”) attached to a timely filed original federal income tax return (including extensions) for the year of the transfer. An increase to the deemed payment rate made pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) will be irrevocable, and a failure to timely file the statement under this paragraph (c)(3)(ii) may not be remedied.

(iii) *Example.* Property subject to section 367(d) is transferred from USP, a domestic corporation, to FA, a foreign corporation wholly owned by USP. The useful life of the transferred property, inclusive of derivative works, at the time of transfer is indefinite but is reasonably anticipated to exceed 20 years. In the first five years following the transfer, sales related to the property are expected to be $100x, $130x, $160x, $180x and $187.2x, respectively. Thereafter, for the remainder of the property's useful life, sales are expected to grow by four percent annually. In the first five years following the transfer, operating profits attributable to the property are expected to be $5x, $8x, $11x, $12.5x, and $13x, respectively. Thereafter, for the remainder of the property's useful life, operating profits are expected to grow by four percent annually. It is determined that the appropriate discount rate for sales and operating profits is 10 percent. The present value of operating profits through the property's indefinite useful life is $185x. The present value of sales through the property's indefinite useful life is $2698x. Accordingly, the sales based royalty rate during the property's useful life is 6.8 percent ($185x/$2698x). The taxpayer may choose to take income inclusions into account over a 20-year period. The present value of sales through the 20-year period is $1787x. Accordingly, the sales based royalty rate under the 20-year option is increased to 10.3 percent ($185x/$1787x).

(c)(4) through (g)(2) (introductory text) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(d)-1T(c)(4) through (g)(2) (introductory text).

(g)(2)(i) The intangible property transferred constitutes an operating intangible, as defined in § 1.367(a)-1(d)(6).

(g)(2)(ii) through (iii)(D) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(2)(ii) through (iii)(D).

(E) The transferred intangible property will be used in the active conduct of a trade or business outside of the United States within the meaning of § 1.367(a)-2 and will not be used in connection with the manufacture or sale of products in or for use or consumption in the United States.

(g)(2)(iii) undesignated concluding paragraph [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(2)(iii) undesignated concluding paragraph.

(3) *Intangible property transferred from branch with previously deducted losses.* (i) If income is required to be recognized under section 904(f)(3) and the regulations thereunder or under § 1.367(a)-6 upon the transfer of intangible property of a foreign branch that had previously deducted losses, then the income recognized under those sections with respect to that property is credited against amounts that would otherwise be required to be recognized with respect to that same property under paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section in either the current or future taxable years. The amount recognized under section 904(f)(3) or § 1.367(a)-6 with respect to the transferred intangible property is determined in accordance with the following formula:

(ii) For purposes of the formula in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section, the “loss recapture income” is the total amount required to be recognized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to section 904(f)(3) or § 1.367(a)-6. The “gain from intangible property” is the total amount of gain realized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to section 904(f)(3) and § 1.367(a)-6 upon the transfer of items of property that are subject to section 367(d). “Gain from intangible property” does not include gain realized with respect to intangible property by reason of an election under paragraph (g)(2) of this section. The “gain from all branch assets” is the total amount of gain realized by the transferor upon the transfer of items of property of the branch for which gain is realized.

(g)(4) through (i) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.367(d)-1T(g)(4) through (i).

(j) *Effective/applicability dates.* This section applies to transfers occurring on or after September 14, 2015, and to transfers occurring before September 14, 2015, resulting from entity classification elections made under § 301.7701-3 that are filed on or after September 14, 2015. For transfers occurring before this section is applicable, see § 1.367(d)-1T as contained in 26 CFR part 1 revised as of April 1, 2016.
