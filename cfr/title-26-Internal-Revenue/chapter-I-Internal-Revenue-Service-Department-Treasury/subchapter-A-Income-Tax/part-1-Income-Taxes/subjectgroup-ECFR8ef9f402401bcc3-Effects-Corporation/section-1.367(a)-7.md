##### § 1.367(a)-7 Outbound transfers of property described in section 361(a) or (b). #####

(a) *Scope and purpose.* This section provides rules under section 367(a)(5) that apply to the transfer of certain property (including stock or securities) by a domestic corporation (U.S. transferor) to a foreign corporation (foreign acquiring corporation) in a section 361 exchange. This section applies only to the transfer of section 367(a) property. See section 367(d) for rules applicable to transfers of section 367(d) property. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule requiring the recognition of gain on the transfer of section 367(a) property, while paragraph (c) of this section provides an elective exception to the general rule that is available if certain requirements are satisfied. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for applying the elective exception to a section 361 exchange followed by successive distributions to which section 355 applies. Paragraph (e) of this section provides rules for recognizing gain on section 367(a) property, not willful relief provisions, an anti-abuse rule, and special rules that take into account income inclusions under § 1.367(b)-4 and gain recognition under § 1.367(a)-6. Paragraph (f) of this section provides definitions, and paragraph (g) of this section provides examples. Paragraph (h) of this section provides applicable cross-references, paragraph (i) of this section is reserved, and paragraph (j) of this section provides effective/applicability dates.

(b) *General rule* - (1) *Nonrecognition exchanges enumerated in section 367(a)(1).* Except to the extent provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, the exceptions to section 367(a)(1) provided in section 367(a) and the regulations under that section do not apply to a transfer of section 367(a) property by a U.S. transferor to a foreign acquiring corporation in a section 361 exchange, and the U.S. transferor shall recognize any gain (but not loss) realized with respect to the section 367(a) property under section 367(a)(1). Realized gain is recognized pursuant to the prior sentence notwithstanding the application of any other nonrecognition provision enumerated in section 367(a)(1) to the transfer (such as section 351 or 354).

(2) *Nonrecognition exchanges not enumerated in section 367(a)(1).* To the extent a transfer of items of property described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section also qualifies for nonrecognition under a provision that is not enumerated in section 367(a)(1) (such as section 1036), the U.S. transferor recognizes gain or loss realized on the transfer of such items of property, but the amount of loss recognized on the property shall not exceed the amount of gain recognized on the property. See section 337(d).

(c) *Elective exception.* Except to the extent provided in paragraph (d) of this section, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to the transfer of section 367(a) property by a U.S. transferor to a foreign acquiring corporation in a section 361 exchange if the conditions of paragraphs (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section are satisfied, and an election to apply the exception provided by this paragraph (c) is made in the manner provided by paragraph (c)(5) of this section. If this paragraph (c) applies to the section 361 exchange, see, for example, § 1.367(a)-2, § 1.367(a)-3, § 1.367(a)-4, or § 1.367(a)-6, as applicable, for additional requirements that must be satisfied in order for the U.S. transferor to not recognize gain under section 367(a)(1) on the transfer of section 367(a) property in the section 361 exchange. Nothing in this section provides for the nonrecognition of gain not otherwise permitted under another provision of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) or the regulations.

(1) *Control.* Immediately before the reorganization, the U.S. transferor is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer, but at least one, control group members. For illustrations of this rule, see paragraph (g) of this section, *Example 4* and *Example 5.*

(2) *Gain recognition* - (i) *Non-control group members.* The U.S. transferor recognizes gain equal to the product of the inside gain multiplied by the aggregate ownership interest percentage of all non-control group members, reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A), (c)(2)(i)(B), and (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section.

(A) Gain recognized with respect to stock or securities under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) (including any portion treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a));

(B) Gain recognized with respect to stock or securities under § 1.367(a)-6 (including any portion treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)) attributable to non-control group members (as determined pursuant to § 1.367(a)-7(e)(5)); and

(C) A deemed dividend included in income under § 1.367(b)-4 attributable to non-control group members (as determined pursuant to § 1.367(a)-7(e)(4)).

(ii) *Control group members.* With respect to each control group member, the U.S. transferor recognizes gain equal to the amount, if any, by which the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section exceeds the amount described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section.

(A) The product of the inside gain multiplied by such control group member's ownership interest percentage, reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*), (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*2*), and (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*3*) of this section (attributable inside gain).

(*1*) Gain recognized with respect to stock or securities under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(C) (including any portion treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)) attributable to the control group member;

(*2*) Gain recognized with respect to stock or securities under § 1.367(a)-6 (including any portion treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)) attributable to the control group member (as determined pursuant to § 1.367(a)-7(e)(5)); and

(*3*) A deemed dividend included in income under § 1.367(b)-4 attributable to the control group member (as determined pursuant to § 1.367(a)-7(e)(4)).

(B) The product of the section 367(a) percentage multiplied by the fair market value of the stock received by the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange and distributed to the control group member under section 354, 355, or 356.

(iii) *Illustration of rules.* For an illustration of gain recognition under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, see paragraph (g) of this section, *Example 1.* For an illustration of gain recognition under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, see paragraph (g) of this section, *Example 2.*

(3) *Basis adjustments required for control group members* - (i) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this section, if there is any attributable inside gain (determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section) with respect to a control group member, then such control group member's aggregate basis in the stock received in exchange for (or with respect to, as applicable) stock or securities of the U.S. transferor under section 354, 355, or 356, as determined under section 358 and the regulations under that section (section 358 basis), is reduced by the amount in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A), (c)(3)(i)(B), or (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section, as applicable.

(A) If the control group member has outside gain, the amount, if any, by which the attributable inside gain, reduced by any gain recognized by the U.S. transferor with respect to the control group member under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, exceeds the control group member's outside gain.

(B) If the control group member has outside loss, the amount, if any, by which the attributable inside gain, reduced by any gain recognized by the U.S. transferor with respect to the control group member under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, exceeds the control group member's outside loss (for this purpose, treating the outside loss as a negative amount).

(C) If the control group member has no outside gain or outside loss, the amount of the attributable inside gain, reduced by any gain recognized by the U.S. transferor with respect to the control group member under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

(ii) *Stock received in the section 361 exchange.* This paragraph (c)(3) applies only to stock received by the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange and distributed to the control group member in exchange for (or with respect to, as applicable) stock or securities of the U.S. transferor.

(iii) *Pro rata adjustments.* The section 358 basis of each share of stock received by the control group member must be reduced pro rata based on the relative section 358 basis of all shares of stock received by the control group member.

(iv) *Successive distributions to which section 355 applies.* Paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not apply to a control group member that distributes the stock of a foreign acquiring corporation received from the U.S. transferor in a distribution satisfying the requirements of section 355 (section 355 distribution) that is in connection with a transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section (relating to successive section 355 distributions). If paragraph (c)(3) of this section does not apply to a control group member pursuant to this paragraph (c)(3)(iv), then paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall apply to the final distributee (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section) that receives the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation in the final section 355 distribution described in paragraph (d) of this section.

(v) *Illustration of rules.* For illustrations of the adjustment to stock basis under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section, see paragraph (g) of this section, *Example 1* and *Example 2,* § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8), *Example 3,* and § 1.1248(f)-2(e), *Example 3.* For an illustration of the adjustment to stock basis under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, see paragraph (g) of this section, *Example 3.*

(4) *Agreement to amend or file a U.S. income tax return* - (i) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the U.S. transferor complies with the requirements of § 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(iii), relating to the requirement to report gain that was not recognized by the U.S. transferor upon certain subsequent dispositions by the foreign acquiring corporation of section 367(a) property received from the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange.

(ii) *Exception.* To the extent section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange is subject to § 1.367(a)-3(e) (relating to transfers of stock or securities by a domestic corporation to a foreign corporation in a section 361 exchange), § 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(iii) does not apply with respect to the transfer of that property.

(5) *Election and reporting requirements* - (i) *General rule.* The U.S. transferor and each control group member elect to apply the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section in the manner provided under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) or (c)(5)(iii) of this section, as applicable, and by entering into a written agreement described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section. If a control group member distributes the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation received from the U.S. transferor in a section 355 distribution that is in connection with a transaction described in paragraph (d) of this section, the final distributee that receives that stock in the final section 355 distribution elects to apply the provisions of this paragraph (c) and enters into the written agreement instead of the control group member. For this purpose, the term *control group member* will be replaced by the term *final distributee,* as appropriate.

(ii) *Control group member* - (A) *Time and manner of making election.* Each control group member elects to apply the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section by including a statement (in the form and with the content specified in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section) on or with a timely filed return for the taxable year in which the reorganization occurs. If the control group member is a member of a consolidated group but is not the common parent of the consolidated group, the common parent makes the election on behalf of the control group member.

(B) *Form and content of election statement.* The statement must be entitled, “ELECTION TO APPLY EXCEPTION UNDER § 1.367(a)-7(c),” and set forth:

(*1*) The name and taxpayer identification number (if any) of the control group member, the U.S. transferor, the foreign acquiring corporation and, in the case of a triangular reorganization (within the meaning of § 1.358-6(b)(2)), the corporation that controls the foreign acquiring corporation; the control group member's ownership interest percentage in the U.S. transferor; and the percentage of voting stock and non-voting stock of the U.S. transferor owned by the control group member for purposes of satisfying the control requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section;

(*2*) If the control group member is a member of a consolidated group but is not the common parent, the name and taxpayer identification number of the common parent;

(*3*) The amount of the adjustment (if any) to stock basis required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the resulting adjusted basis in the stock, and the fair market value of the stock, or if no stock was received, indicate no stock was received; and

(*4*) The date on which the written agreement described in paragraph (c)(5)(iv) of this section was entered into.

(iii) *Statement by U.S. transferor.* The U.S. transferor elects to apply the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section in the form and manner set forth in § 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(ii).

(iv) *Written agreement.* The U.S. transferor and each control group member must enter into a written agreement satisfying the conditions of this paragraph on or before the due date (including extensions) for the U.S. transferor's tax return for the taxable year in which the reorganization occurs. Each party to the agreement must retain the original or a copy of the agreement in the manner specified by § 1.6001-1(e). Each party to the agreement must provide a copy of the agreement to the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days of the receipt of a request for the copy of the agreement. The written agreement must -

(A) State the document constitutes an agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this section;

(B) Identify the U.S. transferor, the foreign acquiring corporation, the corporation that controls the foreign acquiring corporation (in the case of a triangular reorganization within the meaning of § 1.358-6(b)(2)), and each control group member, and provide the taxpayer identification number (if any) for each corporation;

(C) State the amount of gain (if any) recognized by the U.S. transferor under paragraph (c)(2) of this section; and

(D) With respect to each control group member, state the amount of the adjustment (if any) to stock basis required under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the resulting adjusted basis in the stock, and the fair market value of the stock. Alternatively, if a control group member did not receive any stock, indicate that no stock was received.

(d) *Section 361 exchange followed by successive distributions to which section 355 applies.* If the U.S. transferor distributes stock of the foreign acquiring corporation received in the section 361 exchange to a control group member in a section 355 distribution and, as part of a plan or series of related transactions, that stock is further distributed in one or more successive section 355 distributions, paragraph (c) of this section can apply to the section 361 exchange only to the extent each subsequent section 355 distribution is to a member of the affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504) that includes the U.S. transferor immediately before the reorganization. In that case, each affiliated group member that receives stock of the foreign acquiring corporation in the final section 355 distribution (final distributee) is subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c)(3) and (c)(5) of this section. If this paragraph (d) applies, then for purposes of applying paragraphs (c)(3), (c)(5) or (e)(2) of this section the term *control group member* is replaced by the term *final distributee,* as appropriate.

(e) *Other rules* - (1) *Section 367(a) property with respect to which gain is recognized.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (e)(1), gain recognized by the U.S. transferor pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section will be treated as recognized with respect to the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange in proportion to the amount of gain realized by the U.S. transferor on the transfer of each item of section 367(a) property. This paragraph (e)(1) will be applied after taking into account any gain or deemed dividends (including any deemed dividends under section 1248(a)) recognized by the U.S. transferor on the transfer of the section 367(a) property in the section 361 exchange pursuant to all other provisions of sections 367(a) and (b) and the regulations under that section. See, for example, §§ 1.367(a)-2, 1.367(a)-3(e), 1.367(a)-4, 1.367(a)-6, and 1.367(b)-4. If the U.S. transferor recognizes gain (including gain treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)) pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C) with respect to stock or securities transferred in the section 361 exchange, the realized gain in such stock or securities shall not be taken into account for purposes of applying this paragraph (e)(1) to gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2) of this section attributable to U.S. transferor shareholders described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C). Accordingly, gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2) attributable to such U.S. transferor shareholders shall not be treated as recognized with respect to such stock or securities under this paragraph. Furthermore, to the extent gain recognized by the U.S. transferor under paragraph (c)(2) is treated as recognized with respect to stock in a foreign corporation transferred in the section 361 exchange to which section 1248(a) applies, the portion of such gain treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a) is the product of the amount of the gain multiplied by the ratio of the amount that would be treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a) if all gain in the transferred stock were recognized under § 1.367(a)-7(b) and the amount of gain realized in the transferred stock. See § 1.367(a)-1(b)(4) for additional rules on the character, source, and adjustments relating to gain recognized under section 367(a)(1), and § 1.367(b)-2(e) for rules on the timing, treatment, and effect of amounts included in income as deemed dividends pursuant to regulations under section 367(b).

(2) *Relief for certain failures to comply that are not willful* - (i) *In general.* A control group member or U.S. transferor's failure to comply with any requirement of this section will be deemed not to have occurred for purposes of satisfying the requirements of this section if the control group member or U.S. transferor (or the foreign acquiring corporation on behalf of the U.S. transferor), as applicable, demonstrates that the failure was not willful using the procedure set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. For this purpose, willful is to be interpreted consistent with the meaning of that term in the context of other civil penalties, which would include a failure due to gross negligence, reckless disregard, or willful neglect. Whether the failure to comply was a willful failure will be determined by the Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business & International (or any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such person) (Director) based on all the facts and circumstances. The control group member or U.S. transferor (or the foreign acquiring corporation on behalf of the U.S. transferor), as applicable, must submit a request for relief and an explanation as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Although a U.S transferor whose failure to comply is determined not to be willful will not be subject to gain recognition under this section, the U.S. transferor will be subject to a penalty under section 6038B if the U.S. transferor fails to demonstrate that the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. See § 1.6038B-1(b) and (f). The determination of whether the failure to comply was willful under this section has no effect on any request for relief made under § 1.6038B-1(f).

(ii) *Procedures for establishing that a failure to comply was not willful* - (A) *Time and manner of submission.* A control group member or U.S. transferor's statement that the failure to comply was not willful will be considered only if, promptly after the control group member or U.S. transferor, as applicable, becomes aware of the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the failure relates that includes the information that should have been included with the original return for such taxable year or that otherwise complies with the rules of this section, and that includes a written statement explaining the reasons for the failure to comply. The amended return must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at the location where the taxpayer filed its original return. The U.S. transferor may submit a request for relief from the penalty under section 6038B as part of the same submission. See § 1.6038B-1(f).

(B) *Notice requirement.* In addition to the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(A) of this section, a control group member or U.S. transferor, as applicable, must comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph (e)(2)(ii)(B). If any taxable year of the control group member or U.S. transferor, as applicable, is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination. If no taxable year of the control group member or U.S transferor, as applicable, is under examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return and any information required to be included with such return must be delivered to the Director.

(iii) For illustrations of the application of the willfulness standard of this paragraph (e)(2), see the examples in § 1.367(a)-8(p)(3).

(3) *Anti-abuse rule.* Any property of the U.S. transferor acquired with a principal purpose of affecting any determination under this section (including, for example, the section 367(a) percentage, inside gain, or inside basis) shall not be taken in account for purposes of any determination under this section. Nothing in this paragraph (e)(3) constitutes a limitation on or modification to judicial doctrines, including step-transaction or substance-over-form.

(4) *Certain income inclusions under § 1.367(b)-4* - (i) *Income inclusion attributable to U.S. transferor shareholder described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A).* If pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C) the U.S. transferor is required to recognize gain on the transfer of foreign stock (all or a portion of which is treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)), and if pursuant to § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) the U.S. transferor is also required to include in income as a deemed dividend the section 1248 amount (within the meaning of § 1.367(b)-2(c)) in the foreign stock, then the section 1248 amount included in income under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) is attributable to each U.S. transferor shareholder described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A) pursuant to this paragraph (e)(4)(i). The portion of the section 1248 amount attributable to each U.S. transferor shareholder described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A) is the portion of the section 1248 amount that bears the same ratio as such U.S. transferor shareholder's ownership interest percentage bears to the aggregate ownership interest percentage of all U.S. transferor shareholders described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A).

(ii) *Ordering rules for determining section 1248 amount.* The section 1248 amount (within the meaning of § 1.367(b)-2(c)) included in income as a deemed dividend under § 1.367(b)-4(b)(1)(i) is determined after taking into account any gain recognized under §§ 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C) or 1.367(a)-6 that is treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a). See § 1.367(a)-3(e)(7) and paragraph (e)(5)(ii) of this section for rules to determine the amount of gain recognized under §§ 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C) or 1.367(a)-6, respectively, that is treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a).

(5) *Certain gain under § 1.367(a)-6* - (i) *Gain attributable to U.S. transferor shareholder described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A).* If pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C), the U.S. transferor is required to recognize gain on the transfer of stock or securities, and if pursuant to § 1.367(a)-6 the U.S. transferor is also required to recognize gain, then gain recognized under § 1.367(a)-6 (including any portion treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)) to the extent treated as recognized with respect to the stock or securities, is attributable to each U.S. transferor shareholder described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A) pursuant to this paragraph (e)(5)(i). The portion of the gain (including any portion treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)) that is attributable to each U.S. transferor shareholder described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A) is the portion of the gain that bears the same ratio as such U.S. transferor shareholder's ownership interest percentage bears to the aggregate ownership interest percentage of all U.S. transferor shareholders described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A).

(ii) *Gain subject to section 1248(a).* If the U.S. transferor recognizes gain under § 1.367(a)-6 with respect to transferred stock that is stock in a foreign corporation to which section 1248(a) applies, the portion of such gain treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a) is determined after taking into account any gain recognized under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C) and the amount of such gain treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a) pursuant to § 1.367(a)-3(e)(7).

(f) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:

(1) *Control group, control group member, and non-control group member* - (i) *General rule.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the *control group* is the group of five or fewer, but at least one, domestic corporations that controls (within the meaning of section 368(c)) the U.S. transferor immediately before the reorganization. If the U.S. transferor is owned directly by more than five domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization, but some combination of five or fewer domestic corporations controls the U.S. transferor, the U.S. transferor must designate the five or fewer domestic corporations that comprise the control group on Form 926, “Return by a U.S. Transferor of Property to a Foreign Corporation.” For purposes of identifying the control group, members of an affiliated group (within the meaning of section 1504) are treated as a single corporation. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, a *control group member* is a domestic corporation that is part of the control group. A *non-control group member* is a shareholder of the U.S. transferor immediately before the reorganization that is not a control group member.

(ii) *Exception for certain entities.* Regulated investment companies (as defined in section 851(a)), real estate investment trusts (as defined in section 856(a)), and S corporations (as defined in section 1361(a)) cannot be control group members.

(2) *Deductible liability* is any liability of the U.S. transferor that is assumed in the section 361 exchange if payment of the liability would give rise to a deduction.

(3) *Fair market value* is the fair market value determined without regard to mortgages, liens, pledges, or other liabilities. For this purpose, the fair market value of any property subject to a nonrecourse indebtedness shall be treated as being not less than the amount of any nonrecourse indebtedness to which such property is subject.

(4) *Inside basis* is the aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property transferred by the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange and, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f)(4), increased by any gain recognized or any deemed dividend included in income by the U.S. transferor under section 367 on the transfer of the section 367(a) property in the section 361 exchange, but not including any gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If the U.S. transferor transfers stock or securities and recognizes gain under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C) with respect to such stock or securities, then inside basis is not increased for gain recognized or deemed dividends included in income that are described in paragraph (f)(4)(i), (f)(4)(ii), or (f)(4)(iii) of this section.

(i) Gain recognized under § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(B) or (e)(3)(iii)(C) (including any portion treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a));

(ii) Gain recognized under § 1.367(a)-6 (including any portion treated as a deemed dividend under section 1248(a)) attributable to U.S. transferor shareholders described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A) (as determined pursuant to § 1.367(a)-7(e)(5));

(iii) A deemed dividend included in income under § 1.367(b)-4(b) attributable to U.S. transferor shareholders described in § 1.367(a)-3(e)(3)(iii)(A) (as determined pursuant to § 1.367(a)-7(e)(4)).

(5) *Inside gain* is the amount (but not below zero) by which the aggregate fair market value of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange exceeds the sum of:

(i) The inside basis; and

(ii) The product of the section 367(a) percentage multiplied by the aggregate deductible liabilities of the U.S. transferor.

(6) *Outside gain or loss* is the product of the section 367(a) percentage multiplied by the difference between -

(i) The aggregate fair market value of the stock received by a control group member in exchange for (or with respect to, as applicable) stock or securities of the U.S. transferor under section 354, 355, or 356, and

(ii) The control group member's aggregate section 358 basis (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) in such stock received, determined without regard to any adjustment to that basis under paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(7) *Ownership interest percentage* is the ratio of the fair market value of the stock in the U.S. transferor owned by a shareholder to the fair market value of all of the outstanding stock of the U.S. transferor. Except as provided in this paragraph (f)(7), the ownership interest percentage of a shareholder is determined immediately before the reorganization. For purposes of determining the ownership interest percentage with respect to each shareholder, however, the numerator and denominator of the fraction are first reduced as described in this paragraph (f)(7). The numerator is reduced (but not below zero) by any distributions by the U.S. transferor of money or other property (within the meaning of section 356) to such shareholder pursuant to the plan of reorganization, but only to the extent such money or other property is not provided by the foreign acquiring corporation in exchange for property of the U.S. transferor acquired in the section 361 exchange. Furthermore, the denominator of the fraction is reduced (but not below zero) by all such distributions by the U.S. transferor to all shareholders. For illustrations of this definition, see paragraph (g) of this section, *Example 4* and *Example 5.*

(8) *Section 361 exchange* is an exchange described in section 361(a) or (b).

(9) *Section 367(a) percentage* is the ratio of the aggregate fair market value of the section 367(a) property transferred by the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange to the aggregate fair market value of all property transferred by the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange.

(10) *Section 367(a) property.* Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, *section 367(a) property* is any property, as defined in § 1.367(a)-1T(d)(4), other than section 367(d) property.

(11) *Section 367(d) property* is intangible property as defined in § 1.367(a)-1(d)(5).

(12) *Timely filed return* is a U.S. income tax return filed on or before the due date set forth in section 6072(b), including any extensions of time to file the return granted under section 6081.

(13) *U.S. transferor shareholder* is a person that is either a control group member or a non-control group member.

(g) *Examples.* The rules of this section are illustrated by the examples set forth in this paragraph (g). See also § 1.367(a)-3(e)(8), *Example 2* and *Example 3.* The analysis of the following examples is limited to a discussion of issues under this section. Unless otherwise indicated, for purposes of the following examples: DP1, DP2, and DC are domestic corporations that do not join in the filing of a consolidated return and none of which is a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust, or an S corporation; FP and FA are foreign corporations created or organized under the laws of Country B and are unrelated to DP1, DP2, and DC; each corporation has a single class of stock outstanding; each share of stock of DC owned by a shareholder of DC has an identical stock basis; Business A consists solely of section 367(a) property whose fair market value exceeds its basis and that, but for the application of this section, would qualify for the active foreign trade or business exception under § 1.367(a)-2; the fair market value of any FA stock received in a reorganization is equal to the fair market value of property exchanged therefor; FA is not a surrogate foreign corporation for purposes of section 7874 because one or more of the conditions of section 7874(a)(2)(B) is not satisfied; DC has no liabilities; DP1 and DP2 satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(5) of this section, and DC satisfies the requirements of § 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(ii).

Example 1. Tainted assets and non-control group ownership.(i) *Facts.* DP1, DP2, and FP own 50%, 30%, and 20%, respectively, of the outstanding stock of DC. DP1 and DP2 are members of the same affiliated group within the meaning of section 1504. DP1's DC stock has a $120x basis and $100x fair market value. DP2's DC stock has a $50x basis and $60x fair market value. DC owns inventory with a $40x basis and a $100x fair market value. DC also owns Business A (excluding the inventory) with a $10x basis and $100x fair market value. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F), DC transfers the inventory and Business A to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for all of the outstanding stock of FA. DC's transfer of the inventory and Business A to FA qualifies as a section 361 exchange. DP1, DP2, and FP exchange the DC stock for a proportionate amount of FA stock pursuant to section 354.

(ii) *Result.* (A) Under section 367(a)(3)(B)(i), DC must recognize $60x gain ($100x fair market value less $40x basis) on the transfer of the inventory to FA. The basis of the inventory in the hands of FA is increased by the gain recognized of $60x (that is, increased from $40x to $100x). See § 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B). Under section 367(a)(5) and paragraph (b) of this section, DC's transfer of Business A to FA is subject to the general rule of section 367(a)(1). As a result, DC must also generally recognize $90x gain ($100x fair market value less $10x basis) on the transfer of Business A to FA notwithstanding the application of section 361 (or any other nonrecognition provision enumerated in section 367(a)(1)). However, if the conditions and requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met, DC's transfer of Business A to FA would qualify for the active foreign trade or business exception provided by section 367(a)(3) and § 1.367(a)-2.

(B) The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation because DP1 and DP2 together own 80% of the stock of DC). DP1 and DP2 are treated as a single domestic corporation for this purpose under paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section because DP1 and DP2 are members of the same affiliated group.

(C) Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section would be satisfied only if DC recognizes $18x gain on the transfer of Business A, which is the amount of inside gain attributable to FP, a non-control group member. The $18x gain equals the product of the inside gain ($90x) multiplied by FP's ownership interest percentage (20%) in DC, reduced by $0x (the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A) through (c)(2)(i)(C) of this section). Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the $90x inside gain is the amount by which the aggregate fair market value ($200x) of the section 367(a) property (inventory and Business A) exceeds $110x, the sum of the inside basis of $110x and the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by the deductible liabilities of DC ($0x). Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the inside basis equals the $50x aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange, increased by the $60x gain recognized by DC on the transfer of the inventory to FA, but not by the $18x gain recognized by DC under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section attributable to FP. The section 367(a) percentage is 100% because the only assets transferred are the inventory and Business A, which are section 367(a) property. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the $18x gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is treated as recognized with respect to Business A. FA's basis in Business A as determined under section 362 is increased for the $18x gain recognized. See § 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B).

(D) Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is not applicable with respect to either DP1 or DP2 because the attributable inside gain with respect to each such shareholder can be preserved in the FA stock received. As stated in paragraph (ii)(C) of this *Example 1,* the amount of the inside gain is $90x. The attributable inside gain with respect to DP1 of $45x (equal to the product of $90x inside gain multiplied by DP1's 50% ownership interest percentage, reduced by $0x (the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*) through (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*3*) of this section)) does not exceed $100x (equal to the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $100x fair market value of FA stock received by DP1). Similarly, the attributable inside gain with respect to DP2 of $27x (equal to the product of $90x inside gain multiplied by DP2's 30% ownership interest percentage, reduced by $0x (the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*) through (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*3*) of this section)) does not exceed $60x (equal to the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $60x fair market value of FA stock received by DP2).

(E) Each control group member (DP1 and DP2) separately computes any required adjustment to stock basis under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. DP1's section 358 basis in the FA stock received of $120x (the amount of DP1's basis in the DC stock exchanged) is reduced to preserve the attributable inside gain with respect to DP1, less any gain recognized with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Because DC does not recognize gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section (as determined in paragraph (ii)(D) of this *Example 1*), the attributable inside gain of $45x with respect to DP1 is not reduced under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section. DP1's outside loss in the FA stock is $20x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $20x loss (equal to the difference between $100x fair market value and $120x section 358 basis in FA stock). Thus, DP1's $120x section 358 basis in the FA stock must be reduced by $65x (excess of $45x, reduced by $0x, over $20x outside loss) to $55x.

(F) DP2's aggregate section 358 basis in the FA stock received of $50x (the amount of DP2's basis in the DC stock exchanged) is reduced to preserve the attributable inside gain with respect to DP2, less any gain recognized with respect to DP2 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. Because DC does not recognize gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to DP2 (as determined in paragraph (ii)(D) of this *Example 1*), the attributable inside gain of $27x with respect to DP2 is not reduced under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section. DP2's outside gain in the FA stock is $10x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $10x gain (equal to the difference between $60x fair market value and $50x section 358 basis in FA stock). Thus, DP2's $50x section 358 basis in the FA stock must be reduced by $17x (excess of $27x, reduced by $0x, over the $10x outside gain) to $33x.

(G) Paragraph (c)(4) of this section would be satisfied only if DC complies with the requirements of § 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(iii), including filing with its timely filed return for the year of the reorganization a statement agreeing to file an amended return reporting the gain realized but not recognized on the section 361 exchange in certain cases if a significant amount of the section 367(a) property received in the section 361 exchange is disposed of, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions within the prescribed 60-month period.

Example 2. Triangular reorganization involving an exchange of section 367(a) property for foreign stock and cash.(i) *Facts.* (A) DP1 wholly owns DC. DP1 and DC file a consolidated return. DP1's DC stock has a $170x basis and $200x fair market value. DC owns Business A, which has a $10x basis and $200x fair market value. FP wholly owns FA.

(B) In a triangular reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(D), DC transfers Business A to FA in exchange for $180x of FP stock and $20x cash. DC's transfer of Business A to FA qualifies as a section 361 exchange. DP1 exchanges its DC stock for $180x of FP stock and $20x cash pursuant to section 356. The triangular reorganization constitutes an indirect stock transfer under § 1.367(a)-3(d)(1)(i), and DP1 properly files a gain recognition agreement under § 1.367(a)-8 with respect to the transfer. See also § 1.367(a)-3(d)(2)(vii).

(ii) *Result.* (A) Under section 367(a)(5) and paragraph (b) of this section, DC's transfer of Business A to FA is subject to the general rule of section 367(a)(1). As a result, DC must generally recognize $190x gain ($200x fair market value less $10x basis) on the transfer of Business A to FA notwithstanding the application of section 361 (or any other nonrecognition exchange enumerated in section 367(a)(1)). However, if the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are satisfied, DC's transfer of Business A to FA would qualify for the active foreign trade or business exception provided in section 367(a)(3) and § 1.367(a)-2.

(B) The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation, DP1).

(C) DC is not required to recognize gain under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section because, immediately before the reorganization, DC is wholly owned by DP1, a control group member. In addition, DP1's ownership interest percentage is 100%. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section would be satisfied only if DC recognizes $10x gain, computed as the amount by which the attributable inside gain with respect to DP1 of $190x (the product of $190x inside gain multiplied by DP1's ownership interest percentage of 100%, reduced by $0x (the sum of the amounts in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*) through (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*3*) of this section)) exceeds $180x (the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $180x fair market value of FP stock received by DP1). Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the $190x inside gain is the amount by which the $200x aggregate fair market value of Business A exceeds $10x (the sum of the inside basis of $10x and the product of the section 367(a) percentage (100%) multiplied by the deductible liabilities of DC ($0x)). Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the inside basis equals the $10x aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange (not increased by the $10x gain recognized by DC under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section). The section 367(a) percentage is 100% because the only asset transferred is Business A, which is section 367(a) property. Under § 1.1502-32(b)(2), DP1 increases the basis of its DC stock by the $10x gain recognized, that is, from $170x to $180x. Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the $10x gain recognized under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is treated as recognized with respect to Business A. FA's basis in Business A as determined under section 362 is increased for the $10x gain recognized. See § 1.367(a)-1(b)(4)(i)(B).

(D) Paragraph (c)(3) of this section would be satisfied only if DP1's section 358 basis in the FP stock is reduced by the amount by which the attributable inside gain with respect to DP1, reduced by any gain recognized by DC with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, exceeds DP1's outside gain in the FP stock. DP1's section 358 basis in the FP stock is $180x, computed as $180x basis in DC stock, as determined in paragraph (ii)(C) of this *Example 2,* decreased by $20x cash received and increased by $20x gain recognized under section 356 (such amount equal to the lesser of the $20x cash received and the $20x gain in the DC stock, computed as $200x fair market value less $180x basis). Because DC recognizes $10x gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section as determined in paragraph (ii)(C) of this *Example 2,* the $190x attributable inside gain with respect to DP1 is reduced by $10x to $180x under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of this section. DP1's outside gain in the FP stock is $0x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 100% multiplied by $0x gain (the difference between $180x fair market value and $180x section 358 basis in FP stock). Thus, DP1's section 358 basis in the FP stock ($180x) must be reduced by $180x ($190x attributable inside gain reduced by $10x) to $0x.

(E) Paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section would be satisfied only if DC complies with the requirements of § 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(iii), including filing with its tax return for the year of the reorganization a statement agreeing to file an amended return reporting the gain on the section 361 exchange in certain cases if a significant amount of the section 367(a) property received in the section 361 exchange is disposed of, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions within the prescribed 60-month period.

Example 3. Adjustment to basis of multiple blocks of stock; transfer of section 367(d) property.(i) *Facts.* (A) DP1 wholly owns DC. One half of DP1's shares of stock in DC, each with an identical basis, has an aggregate basis of $60x and fair market value of $100x (Block 1). The other one half of DP's shares of stock in DC, each with an identical basis, has an aggregate basis of $120x and fair market value of $100x (Block 2). DC owns Business A ($15x basis and $150x fair market value) (excluding the patent) and a patent ($0x basis and $50x fair market value). The patent is section 367(d) property.

(B) In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(F), DC transfers Business A and the patent to FA, a newly formed corporation, in exchange for 2 shares of FA stock. DC's transfer of Business A and the patent to FA qualifies as a section 361 exchange. DP1 exchanges Block 1 and Block 2 for the two shares of FA stock pursuant to section 354. Pursuant to § 1.358-2(a)(2)(i), one share of the FA stock corresponds to Block 1 (Share 1) and the other share of FA stock corresponds to Block 2 (Share 2). The basis of Share 1 and Share 2 correspond to the basis of Block 1 and Block 2, respectively.

(ii) *Result.* (A) Under section 367(a)(5) and paragraph (b) of this section, DC's transfer of Business A to FA is subject to the general rule of section 367(a)(1). As a result, DC must generally recognize $135x of gain on the transfer of Business A to FA notwithstanding the application of section 361 (or any other nonrecognition exchange described in section 367(a)(1)). However, if the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section are met, DC's transfer of Business A to FA would qualify for the active foreign trade or business exception provided in section 367(a)(3). For rules applicable to DC's transfer of the patent to FA, see section 367(d).

(B) The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation, DP1).

(C) Paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is not applicable because, immediately before the reorganization, DC is wholly owned by DP1, a control group member. In addition, DP1's ownership interest percentage is 100%. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section is not applicable because the attributable inside gain with respect to DP1 can be preserved in the FA stock received. The attributable inside gain with respect to DP1 of $135x (equal to the product of $135x inside gain multiplied by DP1's 100% ownership interest percentage, reduced by $0x (the sum of the amounts in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*1*) through (c)(2)(ii)(A)(*3*) of this section)) does not exceed $150x (equal to the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 75% multiplied by $200x fair market value of FA stock received by DP1). Under paragraph (f)(5) of this section, the $135x inside gain is the amount by which the aggregate fair market value of Business A ($150x) exceeds $15x, the sum of the inside basis of Business A ($15x) and the product of the section 367(a) percentage (75%) multiplied by the deductible liabilities of DC ($0x). Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, the inside basis equals the $15x aggregate basis of the section 367(a) property transferred in the exchange. The section 367(a) percentage of 75% is equal to the ratio of the fair market value of the section 367(a) property ($150x for Business A) to the fair market value of all the property transferred ($200x, the sum of $150x for Business A and $50x for the patent).

(D) Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, DP1's aggregate section 358 basis of $180x in the stock of FA (computed as the sum of $60x basis in Share 1 and $120x basis in Share 2) is reduced by the amount by which the attributable inside gain with respect to DP1, reduced by any gain recognized by DC with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, exceeds DP1's outside gain in the FP stock received. Because DC recognizes no gain on the section 361 exchange with respect to DP1 under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section as determined in paragraph (ii)(C) of this *Example 3,* the $135x attributable inside gain with respect to DP1 is not reduced under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of this section. DP1's outside gain in Share 1 and Share 2 in the aggregate is $15x, the product of the section 367(a) percentage of 75% multiplied by $20x (the difference between $200x aggregate fair market value and $180x aggregate section 358 basis in the FA stock received by DP1). Thus, DP1's section 358 basis in the FA stock ($180x) must be reduced by $120x (the excess of $135x attributable inside gain, reduced by $0x, over $15x outside gain) to $60x.

(E) Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the $120x reduction to basis is allocated between Share 1 and Share 2 based on the relative section 358 basis of each share. Therefore, the basis in Share 1 is reduced by $40x ($120x multiplied by $60x/$180x). As adjusted, DP1's basis in Share 1 is $20x ($60x less $40x). The basis in Share 2 is reduced by $80x ($120x multiplied by $120x/$180x). As adjusted, DP1's basis in Share 2 is $40x ($120x less $80x).

(F) Paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section would be satisfied only if DC complies with the requirements of § 1.6038B-1(c)(6)(iii), including filing with its tax return for the year of the reorganization, a statement agreeing to file an amended return reporting the gain realized but not recognized on the section 361 exchange in certain cases if a significant amount of the section 367(a) property received in the section 361 exchange is disposed of, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions within the prescribed 60-month period.

Example 4. Control requirement and ownership interest percentage; non-qualified property provided by foreign acquiring corporation.(i) *Facts.* DP1 and FP own 80% and 20%, respectively, of the outstanding stock of DC. DC owns Business A with a basis of $0x and $100x fair market value. DP1's DC stock has a fair market value of $80x, and FP's DC stock has a fair market value of $20x. In a reorganization described in section 368(a)(1)(D), DC transfers Business A to FA in exchange for $80x of FA stock and $20x cash. DC's transfer of Business A to FA qualifies as a section 361 exchange. DP1 exchanges its $80x of DC stock for $60x of FA stock and $20x cash, and FP exchanges its $20x of DC stock for $20x of FA stock.

(ii) *Result.* (A) The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation, DP1). The fact that the $20x cash is distributed solely to DP1 does not change the analysis of the control requirement. The control requirement is determined immediately before the reorganization and is not affected by distributions of property.

(B) Pursuant to paragraph (f)(7) of this section, the ownership interest percentages of DP1 and FP immediately before the reorganization are 80% ($80x/($80x + $20x)) and 20% ($20x/($80x + $20x)), respectively. The fact that the $20x of cash is distributed solely to DP1 does not change this result. The distribution of the $20x of cash is not taken into account for purposes of the ownership interest percentage computation because the $20x of cash distributed by DC is provided by FA to DC in the section 361 exchange.

Example 5. Control requirement and ownership interest percentage; non-qualified property provided by U.S. transferor.(i) *Facts.* The facts are the same as in *Example 4,* except as follows. Business A has a fair market value of $80x (and not $100x) and DC also owns inventory with a basis of $0x and fair market value of $20x. DC transfers Business A, but not the inventory, to FA in exchange for $80x of FA stock. DP1 exchanges its $80x of DC stock for $60x of FA stock and the $20x of inventory, and FP exchanges its $20x of DC stock for $20x of FA stock.

(ii) *Result.* (A) The requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section is satisfied because DC is controlled (within the meaning of section 368(c)) by five or fewer domestic corporations immediately before the reorganization (in this case, by a single domestic corporation, DP1). The fact that the $20x of inventory is not transferred to FA, but is instead distributed solely to DP1, does not change the analysis of the control requirement. The control requirement is determined immediately before the reorganization, and is not affected by distributions of property.

(B) Pursuant to the general rule of paragraph (f)(7) of this section, the ownership interest percentages of DP1 and FP immediately before the reorganization would be 80% ($80x/($80x + $20x)) and 20% ($20x/($80x + $20x)), respectively. In this case, however, the distribution of the $20x inventory to DP1 is taken into account for purposes of computing the ownership interest percentage of DP1 and FP because the inventory is not provided by FA to DC in the section 361 exchange. With respect to DP1, the numerator of the ownership interest percentage computation is $60x, computed as the fair market value of DC stock owned by DP1 immediately before the reorganization but reduced by the fair market value of the inventory distributed to DP1 ($80x less $20x). With respect to FP, the numerator of the ownership interest percentage computation is $20x, the fair market value of the DC stock owned by FP immediately before the reorganization. With respect to both DP1 and FP, the denominator of the ownership interest percentage computation is $80x, computed as the fair market value of all DC stock immediately before the reorganization, but reduced by the fair market value of the inventory distributed to DP1 ($100x, less $20x). Accordingly, the ownership interest percentage of DP1 is 75% ($60x/$80x), and the ownership interest percentage of FP is 25% ($20x/$80x).
