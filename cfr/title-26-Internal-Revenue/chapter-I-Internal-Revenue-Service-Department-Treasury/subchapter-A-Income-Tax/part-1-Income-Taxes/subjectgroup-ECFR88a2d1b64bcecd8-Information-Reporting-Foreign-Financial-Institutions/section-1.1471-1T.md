(99) *Permanent residence address.* The term *permanent residence address* is the address in the country of which the person claims to be a resident for purposes of that country's income tax. The address of a financial institution with which the person maintains an account, a post office box, or an address used solely for mailing purposes is not a permanent residence address unless such address is the only permanent address used by the person and appears as the person's registered address in the person's organizational documents. An address that is provided subject to instructions to hold all mail to that address must be accompanied by certain documentary evidence described in § 1.1441-1(c)(38)(ii). If the person is an individual who does not have a tax residence in any country, the permanent address is the place at which the person normally resides. If the person is an entity and does not have a tax residence in any country, then the permanent residence address is the place at which the person maintains its principal office.
