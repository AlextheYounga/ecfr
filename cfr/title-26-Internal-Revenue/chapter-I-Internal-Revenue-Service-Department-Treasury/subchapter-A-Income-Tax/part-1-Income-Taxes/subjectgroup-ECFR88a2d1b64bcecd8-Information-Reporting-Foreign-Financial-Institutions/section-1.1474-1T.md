(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section or in the instructions to Form 1042-S, every withholding agent must file an information return on Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person's U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) to report to the IRS chapter 4 reportable amounts as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section that were paid to a recipient during the preceding calendar year. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)(B) (certain unknown recipients) and (d)(4)(i)(B) and (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section (describing payees includable in reporting pools of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI), a separate Form 1042-S must be filed with the IRS for each recipient of an amount subject to reporting under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section and for each separate type of payment made to a single recipient in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section. The Form 1042-S shall be prepared in such manner as the form and its accompanying instructions prescribe. One copy of the Form 1042-S shall be filed with the IRS on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject to reporting was paid, with a transmittal form as provided in the instructions to the form. Withholding certificates, certifications, documentary evidence, or other statements or documentation provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the form. A copy of the Form 1042-S must be furnished to the recipient for whom the form is prepared (or any other person, as required under this paragraph or the instructions to the form) and to any intermediary or flow-through entity described in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section on or before March 15 of the calendar year following the year in which the amount subject to reporting was paid. The withholding agent must retain a copy of each Form 1042-S for the period of limitations on assessment and collection applicable to the tax reportable on the Form 1042 to which the Form 1042-S relates (determined as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section).

(B) *Payments to participating FFIs, deemed-compliant FFIs, and certain QIs.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B), a U.S. withholding agent that makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT must complete a Form 1042-S treating such FFI as the recipient. With respect to a payment of U.S. source FDAP income made to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT or QI that elects to be withheld upon under section 1471(b)(3) and from whom the withholding agent receives an FFI withholding statement allocating the payment (or portion of the payment) to a chapter 4 withholding rate pool, a U.S. withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to the participating FFI, registered deemed-compliant FFI, or QI (as applicable) as the recipient with respect to each such pool identified on an FFI withholding statement, described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii)(B)(*2*). If, however, a participating FFI, deemed-compliant FFI, or QI (as applicable) has made an election under § 1.1471-4(b)(3)(iii), for the portion of the payment that the FFI allocates to each recalcitrant account holder that is subject to backup withholding under section 3406, the withholding agent must report on Form 1099 the amount of the payment and tax withheld in accordance with the form's requirements and accompanying instructions. See § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(i) for the requirement of a withholding agent to withhold on payments of U.S. source FDAP income made to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT. See also § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(iii) in the case of payments made to a QI. See § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(A) for the extent to which reporting is required under that section for U.S. source FDAP income that is reportable on Form 1042-S under chapter 3 and not subject to withholding under chapter 4, in which case the U.S. withholding agent must report in the manner described under § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(ii) and paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section. See paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for reporting rules applicable if participating FFIs or deemed-compliant FFIs provide specific payee information for reporting to the recipient of the payment for Form 1042-S reporting purposes. See paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section for the residual reporting responsibilities of an NQI, NWP, or NWT that is an FFI.

(C) through (D) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(i)(C) through (d)(4)(i)(D)(*3*).

(E) *Amounts paid to NFFEs.* A U.S. withholding agent that makes payments of chapter 4 reportable amounts to an excepted or passive NFFE shall complete Forms 1042-S treating the NFFE as the recipient, except when the NFFE is a flow-through entity or acting as an intermediary and the partner or beneficiary is treated as the payee. In cases in which the chapter 4 reportable amount is also an amount of U.S. source FDAP income reportable on Form 1042-S (described in § 1.1441-2(a)), see also § 1.1461-1(c)(4)(A) for the extent to which reporting is required with respect to the partners, beneficiaries, or owners of such entities.

(ii) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(ii).

(A) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(ii)(A).

(B) *Nonparticipating FFI that is a flow-through entity or intermediary.* If a withholding agent makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a nonparticipating FFI that it is required to treat as an intermediary with regard to a payment or as a flow-through entity under rules described in § 1.1471-3(c)(3)(iii), and except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A)(*1*)(*x*) of this section (relating to an exempt beneficial owner), the withholding agent must report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient and report the nonparticipating FFI as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.

(C) *Disregarded entities.* If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment to a disregarded entity and receives a valid withholding certificate or other documentary evidence from the person that is the single owner of such disregarded entity, the withholding agent must file a Form 1042-S treating the single owner as the recipient in accordance with the instructions to the Form 1042-S.

(iii) *Reporting by participating FFIs and deemed-compliant FFIs (including QIs, WPs, and WTs)* - (A) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(B) (relating to NQIs, NWPs, NWTs, and FFIs electing under section 1471(b)(3)) and § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F) (relating to transitional payee-specific reporting for payments to nonparticipating FFIs), a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, WT, or U.S. branch of a participating FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person) that makes a payment that is a chapter 4 reportable amount to a recalcitrant account holder or nonparticipating FFI must complete a Form 1042-S to report such payments. A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, WT, or U.S. branch of a participating FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person) may report in pools consisting of its recalcitrant account holders and payees that are nonparticipating FFIs. With respect to recalcitrant account holders, the FFI may report in pools consisting of recalcitrant account holders within a particular status described in § 1.1471-4(d)(6) and within a particular income code. Except as otherwise provided in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F), with respect to payees that are nonparticipating FFIs, the FFI may report in pools consisting of one or more nonparticipating FFIs that fall within a particular income code and within a particular status code described in the instructions to Form 1042-S. Alternatively, a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including a QI, WP, WT, or U.S. branch of a participating FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person) may (and a certified deemed-compliant FFI is required to) perform payee-specific reporting to report a chapter 4 reportable amount paid to a recalcitrant account holder or a nonparticipating FFI when withholding was applied (or should have applied) to the payment.

(B) *Special reporting requirements of participating FFIs, deemed-compliant FFIs, and FFIs that make an election under section 1471(b)(3).* Except as otherwise provided in § 1.1471-4(d)(2)(ii)(F), a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, NWT (including a U.S. branch of a participating FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person), or an FFI that has made an election under section 1471(b)(3) and has provided sufficient information to its withholding agent to withhold and report the payment is not required to report the payment on Form 1042-S as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section if the payment is made to a nonparticipating FFI or recalcitrant account holder and its withholding agent has withheld the correct amount of tax on such payment and correctly reported the payment on a Form 1042-S. Such FFI is required to report a payment, however, when the FFI knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld by the withholding agent on the payment or the withholding agent has not correctly reported the payment on Form 1042-S. In such case, the FFI must report on Form 1042-S to the extent required under paragraph (d)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. See, however, § 1.1471-4(d)(6) for the requirement to report certain aggregate information regarding accounts held by recalcitrant account holders on Form 8966, “FATCA Report,” regardless of whether withholdable payments are made to such accounts.

(C) *Reporting by a U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person.* A U.S. branch treated as a U.S. person (as defined in § 1.1471-1(b)(135)) must report amounts paid to recipients on Forms 1042-S in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section.

(iv) through (vi) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iv) through (vi).

(e) through (h) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1(e) through (h).

(i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1(i).
