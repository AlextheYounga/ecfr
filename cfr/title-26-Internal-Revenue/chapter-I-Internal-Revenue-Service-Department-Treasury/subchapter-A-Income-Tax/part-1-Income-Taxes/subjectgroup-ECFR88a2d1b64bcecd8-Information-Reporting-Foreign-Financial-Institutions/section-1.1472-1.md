##### § 1.1472-1 Withholding on NFFEs. #####

(a) *In general.* This section provides rules that a withholding agent must apply to determine its obligations to withhold under section 1472 on withholdable payments made to a payee that is an NFFE. A participating FFI that complies with its withholding obligations under § 1.1471-4(b) will be deemed to satisfy its obligations under section 1472 with respect to withholdable payments made to NFFEs that are account holders. The rules of this section will apply, however, in the case of a participating FFI acting as a withholding agent with respect to a payment made to an NFFE that is not an account holder (for example, a payment with respect to a contract that does not constitute a financial account). See § 1.1473-1(a)(4)(vi), however, for rules excepting from the definition of withholdable payment certain payments of U.S. source FDAP income made prior to January 1, 2017, with respect to an offshore obligation and § 1.1471-2(b) for rules excepting from the definition of withholdable payment a grandfathered obligation. See also § 1.1471-2(a)(2)(ii), (iv), (v), and (vi) for special rules of withholding that apply for purposes of this section and § 1.1471-2(a)(5) for withholding requirements if the source or character of a payment is unknown.

(b) *Withholdable payments made to an NFFE* - (1) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1472-1T(b)(1).

(i) The beneficial owner of such payment is the NFFE or any other NFFE;

(ii) The withholding agent can, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section, treat the beneficial owner of the payment as an NFFE that does not have any substantial U.S. owners, or as an NFFE that has identified its substantial U.S. owners; and

(iii) The withholding agent reports the information described in § 1.1474-1(i)(2) relating to any substantial U.S. owners of the beneficial owner of such payment.

(2) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1472-1T(b)(2).

(c) *Exceptions* - (1) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1472-1T(c)(1).

(i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1472-1T(c)(1)(i).

(A) *Regularly traded.* For purposes of this section, stock of a corporation is *regularly traded* on one or more established securities markets for a calendar year if -

(*1*) One or more classes of stock of the corporation that, in the aggregate, represent more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of such corporation entitled to vote and of the total value of the stock of such corporation are listed on such market or markets during the prior calendar year; and

(*2*) With respect to each class relied on to meet the more-than-50-percent listing requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A)(*1*) of this section -

(*i*) Trades in each such class are effected, other than in de minimis quantities, on such market or markets on at least 60 days during the prior calendar year; and

(*ii*) The aggregate number of shares in each such class that are traded on such market or markets during the prior year are at least 10 percent of the average number of shares outstanding in that class during the prior calendar year.

(B) *Special rules regarding the regularly traded requirement* - (*1*) *Year of initial public offering.* For the calendar year in which a corporation initiates a public offering of a class of stock for trading on one or more established securities markets, as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this section, such class of stock meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) for such year if the stock is regularly traded in more than de minimis quantities on1/6 of the days remaining after the date of the offering in the quarter during which the offering occurs, and on at least 15 days during each remaining quarter of the calendar year. If a corporation initiates a public offering of a class of stock in the fourth quarter of the calendar year, such class of stock meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) in the calendar year of the offering if the stock is regularly traded on such established securities market, other than in de minimis quantities, on the greater of1/6 of the days remaining after the date of the offering in the quarter during which the offering occurs, or 5 days.

(*2*) *Classes of stock treated as meeting the regularly traded requirement.* A class of stock meets the trading requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) for a calendar year if the stock is traded during such year on an established securities market located in the United States and is regularly quoted by dealers making a market in the stock. A dealer makes a market in a stock only if the dealer regularly and actively offers to, and in fact does, purchase the stock from, and sell the stock to, customers who are not related persons (as defined in section 954(d)(3)) with respect to the dealer in the ordinary course of a trade or business.

(*3*) *Anti-abuse rule.* Any trade conducted with a principal purpose of meeting the regularly traded requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) shall be disregarded. Further, a class of stock shall not be treated as regularly traded if there is a pattern of trades conducted to meet the requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i). Similarly, paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B)(*1*) of this section shall not apply to a public offering of stock that has as one of its principal purposes qualification of the class of stock as regularly traded under the reduced regularly traded requirements for the calendar year of an initial public offering. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, consideration will be given to whether the regularly traded requirements of this paragraph (c)(1)(i) are satisfied in the calendar year immediately following the initial public offering.

(C) *Established securities market* - (*1*) *In general.* For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(i), the term *established securities market* means, for any calendar year -

(*i*) A foreign securities exchange that is officially recognized, sanctioned, or supervised by a governmental authority of the foreign country in which the market is located, and has an annual value of shares traded on the exchange (or a predecessor exchange) exceeding $1 billion during each of the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the determination is being made;

(*ii*) A national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78f) with the Securities and Exchange Commission;

(*iii*) Any exchange designated under a Limitation on Benefits article of an income tax treaty with the United States that is in force; or

(*iv*) Any other exchange that the Secretary may designate in published guidance.

(*2*) *Foreign exchange with multiple tiers.* If an exchange in a foreign country has more than one tier or market level on which stock may be separately listed or traded, each such tier shall be treated as a separate exchange.

(*3*) *Computation of dollar value of stock traded.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C)(*1*)(*i*) of this section, the value in U.S. dollars of shares traded during a calendar year shall be determined on the basis of the dollar value of such shares traded as reported by the World Federation of Exchanges located in Paris (or a successor institution), or, if not so reported, by converting into U.S. dollars the aggregate value in local currency of the shares traded using an exchange rate equal to the average of the spot rates on the last day of each month of the calendar year.

(iii) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1472-1T(c)(1)(iii).

(iv) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1472-1T(c)(1)(iv).

(A) *Passive income.* Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B) of this section, the term *passive income* means the portion of gross income that consists of -

(*1*) Dividends, including substitute dividend amounts;

(*5*) Annuities;

(*6*) The excess of gains over losses from the sale or exchange of property that gives rise to passive income described in paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)(A)(*1*) through (*5*) of this section;

(*7*) The excess of gains over losses from transactions (including futures, forwards, and similar transactions) in any commodities, but not including -

(*i*) Any commodity hedging transaction described in section 954(c)(5)(A), determined by treating the entity as a controlled foreign corporation; or

(*ii*) Active business gains or losses from the sale of commodities, but only if substantially all the foreign entity's commodities are property described in paragraph (1), (2), or (8) of section 1221(a);

(*8*) The excess of foreign currency gains over foreign currency losses (as defined in section 988(b)) attributable to any section 988 transaction;

(*9*) Net income from notional principal contracts as defined in § 1.446-3(c)(1);

(*10*) Amounts received under cash value insurance contracts; or

(*11*) Amounts earned by an insurance company in connection with its reserves for insurance and annuity contracts.

For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(B)(*1*), the term “related person” has the meaning given such term by section 954(d)(3) determined by substituting “foreign entity” for “controlled foreign corporation” each place it appears in section 954(d)(3); or

(*2*) In the case of a foreign entity that regularly acts as a dealer in property described in paragraph (c)(1)(iv)(A)(*6*) of this section (referring to the sale or exchange of property that gives rise to passive income), forward contracts, option contracts, or similar financial instruments (including notional principal contracts and all instruments referenced to commodities) -

(*i*) Any item of income or gain (other than any dividends or interest) from any transaction (including hedging transactions and transactions involving physical settlement) entered into in the ordinary course of such dealer's trade or business as such a dealer; and

(*ii*) If such dealer is a dealer in securities (within the meaning of section 475(c)(2)), any income from any transaction entered into in the ordinary course of such trade or business as a dealer in securities.

(3) *Payments made to a partner or beneficiary of an NFFE that is an NWP or NWT.* A withholding agent may treat a partner or beneficiary of an NFFE that is an NWP or NWT, respectively, as the payee of a withholdable payment under this section if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with a valid Form W-8 or written notification that the NFFE is a flow-through entity as described in § 1.1471-3(c)(2), including valid documentation sufficient to establish the chapter 4 status of each payee of the payment that is a partner or beneficiary, respectively, by applying the rules described in § 1.1471-3(d).

(4) *Payments made to a beneficial owner that is an NFFE.* A withholding agent may treat the beneficial owner of a withholdable payment as an NFFE that does not have any substantial U.S. owners or that has identified all of its substantial U.S. owners if it can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation identifying the beneficial owner as an NFFE that does not have any substantial U.S. owners or that has identified all of its substantial U.S. owners by applying the rules described in § 1.1471-3(d).
