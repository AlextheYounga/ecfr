##### § 1.1471-5 Definitions applicable to section 1471. #####

(a) *U.S. accounts* - (1) *In general.* This paragraph (a) defines the term *U.S. account* and describes when a person is treated as the holder of a financial account (account holder). This paragraph also provides rules for determining when an exception to U.S. account status applies for certain depository accounts, including account aggregation requirements relevant to applying the exception.

(2) *Definition of U.S. account.* Subject to the exception described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, a U.S. account is any financial account maintained by an FFI that is held by one or more specified U.S. persons or U.S. owned foreign entities. For the definition of the term financial account, see paragraph (b) of this section. For the definition of the term specified U.S. person, see § 1.1473-1(c). For the definition of the term U.S. owned foreign entity, see paragraph (c) of this section. For reporting requirements of participating FFIs with respect to U.S. accounts, see § 1.1471-4(d).

(3) *Account holder* - (i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(a)(3)(i).

(ii) *Financial accounts held by agents that are not financial institutions.* A person, other than a financial institution, that holds a financial account for the benefit or account of another person as an agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as an account holder with respect to such account for purposes of this section. Instead, such other person is treated as the account holder.

(iii) *Jointly held accounts.* With respect to a jointly held account, each joint holder is treated as an account holder for purposes of determining whether the account is a U.S. account. Thus, an account is a U.S. account if any of the account holders is a specified U.S. person or a U.S. owned foreign entity and the account is not otherwise excepted from U.S. account status under paragraph (a)(4) of this section. When more than one U.S. person is a joint holder, each U.S. person will be treated as an account holder and will be attributed the entire balance of the jointly held account, including for purposes of applying the aggregation rules set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section.

(iv) *Account holder for insurance and annuity contracts.* An insurance or annuity contract is held by each person that is entitled to access the contract's value (for example, through a loan, withdrawal, surrender, or otherwise) or change a beneficiary under the contract. If no person can access the contract's value or change a beneficiary, the account holders are any person named in the contract as an owner and any person who is entitled to receive a future payment under the terms of the contract. When an obligation to pay an amount under the contract becomes fixed, each person entitled to receive a payment is an account holder.

(v) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section:

Example 1. Account held by agent.F, a nonresident alien, holds a power of attorney from U, a specified U.S. person, that authorizes F to open, hold, and make deposits and withdrawals with respect to a depository account on behalf of U. The balance of the account for the calendar year is $100,000. F is listed as the holder of the depository account at a participating FFI, but because F holds the account as an agent for the benefit of U, F is not ultimately entitled to the funds in the account. Because the depository account is treated as held by U, a specified U.S. person, the account is a U.S. account.Example 2. Jointly held accounts.U, a specified U.S. person, holds a depository account in a participating FFI. The balance of the account for the calendar year is $100,000. The account is jointly held with A, an individual who is a nonresident alien. Because one of the joint holders is a specified U.S. person, the account is a U.S. account.Example 3. Jointly held accounts.U and Q, both specified U.S. persons, hold a depository account in a participating FFI. The balance of the account for the calendar year is $100,000. The account is a U.S. account and both U and Q are treated as holders of the account.

(4) *Exceptions to U.S. account status* - (i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(a)(4)(i).

(ii) *Election to forgo exception.* A participating FFI may elect to disregard the exception described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section by reporting all U.S. accounts, including those accounts that would otherwise meet the conditions of the exception.

(iii) *Example. Aggregation rules for exception to U.S. account status for certain depository accounts.* In Year 1, a U.S. resident individual, U, holds a depository account with CB, a commercial bank that is a participating FFI. The balance in U's CB account at the end of Year 1 is $35,000. In Year 1, U also holds a custodial account with CB's brokerage business. The custodial account has a $45,000 balance as of the end of Year 1. CB's retail banking and brokerage businesses share computerized information management systems that associate U's depository account and U's custodial account with U and with one another within the meaning of paragraph (b)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. For purposes of applying the $50,000 threshold described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, however, a depository account is aggregated only with other depository accounts. Therefore, U's depository account is eligible for the paragraph (a)(4)(i) exception to U.S. account status because the balance of the depository account does not exceed $50,000.

(b) *Financial accounts* - (1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), the term *financial account* means -

(i) *Depository account.* Any depository account (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section) maintained by a financial institution;

(ii) *Custodial account.* Any custodial account (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section) maintained by a financial institution;

(iii) *Equity or debt interest* - (A) *Equity or debt interests in an investment entity.* Any equity or debt interest (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section) in an investment entity described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) or (C) of this section (including an entity that is also a depository institution, custodial institution, insurance company, or investment entity described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section);

(B) *Certain equity or debt interests in a holding company or treasury center.* Any equity or debt interest (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section) in a holding company or treasury center described in paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section if -

(*1*) The expanded affiliated group of which the entity is a member includes one or more investment entities described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) or (C) of this section or passive NFFEs and the income derived by such investment entities or passive NFFEs is 50 percent or more of the aggregate income earned by the expanded affiliated group;

(*2*) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(b)(1)(iii)(B)(*2*).

(*3*) The value of the interest is determined, directly or indirectly, primarily by reference to assets that give rise (or could give rise) to withholdable payments (as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(v)) of this section); or

(*4*) The interest is issued with a principal purpose of avoiding the reporting or withholding requirements of chapter 4;

(C) *Equity or debt interests in other financial institutions.* Any equity or debt interest (other than interests regularly traded on an established securities market under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section) in an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section, or insurance company if -

(*1*) The value of the interest is determined, directly or indirectly, primarily by reference to assets that give rise (or could give rise) to withholdable payments (as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this section); or

(*2*) The interest is issued with a principal purpose of avoiding the reporting or withholding requirements of chapter 4.

(iv) *Insurance and annuity contracts.* A contract issued or maintained by an insurance company, a holding company (as described in paragraph (e)(5)(i)(C) of this section) of an insurance company, or a financial institution described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), or (v) of this section, if the contract is a cash value insurance contract (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section) or an annuity contract.

(2) *Exceptions.* A financial account does not include an account described in this paragraph (b)(2).

(i) *Certain savings accounts* - (A) *Retirement and pension accounts.* A retirement or pension account that satisfies the following conditions under the laws of the jurisdiction where the account is maintained:

(*1*) The account is subject to regulation as a personal retirement account or is part of a registered or regulated retirement or pension plan for the provision of retirement or pension benefits (including disability or death benefits);

(*2*) The account is tax-favored (as described in paragraph (b)(2)(i)(E) of this section);

(*4*) Annual contributions are limited to $50,000 or less;

(C) *Rollovers.* An account that otherwise satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section will not fail to satisfy such requirements solely because such account may receive assets or funds transferred from one or more accounts that meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, one or more retirement or pension funds that meet the requirements of § 1.1471-6(f), one or more accounts described in paragraph (b)(2)(vi) of this section, or one or more entities identified as nonreporting financial institutions under the terms of an applicable Model 1 or Model 2 IGA because they are retirement or pension funds.

(D) *Coordination with section 6038D.* The exclusions provided under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall not apply for purposes of determining whether an account or other arrangement is a financial account for purposes of section 6038D.

(E) *Account that is tax-favored.* For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(i), an account is tax-favored under the laws of a jurisdiction where the account is maintained if -

(v) *Value of interest determined, directly or indirectly, primarily by reference to assets that give rise (or could give rise) to withholdable payments* - (A) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(b)(3)(v)(A).

(B) *Debt interest.* The value of a debt interest is determined, directly or indirectly, primarily by reference to assets that give rise (or could give rise) to withholdable payments if -

(*1*) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(b)(3)(v)(B)(*1*).

(vi) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(b)(3)(vi) through (b)(3)(vi)(B)(*2*).

(vii) *Cash value insurance contract* - (A) *In general.* The term *cash value insurance contract* means an insurance contract (other than an indemnity reinsurance contract between two insurance companies and a term life insurance contract described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) that has an aggregate cash value greater than $50,000 at any time during the calendar year, applying the rules set forth in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. A participating FFI may elect to disregard the $50,000 threshold in the preceding sentence by reporting all contracts with a cash value greater than zero.

(B) *Cash value.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(C) of this section, the term *cash value* means any amount (determined without reduction for any charge or policy loan) that -

(*1*) Is payable under the contract to any person upon surrender, termination, cancellation, or withdrawal; or

(*2*) Any person can borrow under or with regard to (for example, by pledging as collateral) the contract.

(C) *Amounts excluded from cash value.* Cash value does not include an amount payable -

(*1*) Solely by reason of the death of an individual insured under a life insurance contract;

(*2*) As a personal injury or sickness benefit or a benefit providing indemnification of an economic loss incurred upon the occurrence of the event insured against;

(*3*) As a refund of a previously paid premium (less cost of insurance charges whether or not actually imposed) under an insurance contract (other than a life insurance or annuity contract) due to cancellation or termination of the contract, decrease in risk exposure during the effective period of the contract, or arising from the correction of a posting or similar error with regard to the premium for the contract; or

(*4*) As a policyholder dividend (other than a termination dividend) provided that the dividend relates to an insurance contract under which the only benefits payable are described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(C)(*2*) of this section.

(*5*) As a return of an advance premium or premium deposit for an insurance contract for which the premium is payable at least annually if the amount of the advance premium or premium deposit does not exceed the next annual premium that will be payable under the contract.

(D) *Policyholder dividend* - (*1*) For purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(C)(*4*) of this section and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a policyholder dividend means any dividend or similar distribution to policyholders in their capacity as such, including -

(*i*) An amount paid or credited (including as an increase in benefits) if the amount is not fixed in the contract but rather depends on the experience of the insurance company or the discretion of management;

(*ii*) A reduction in the premium that, but for the reduction, would have been required to be paid; and

(*iii*) An experience rated refund or credit based solely upon the claims experience of the contract or group involved.

(*3*) A policyholder dividend does not include any amount that is in the nature of interest that is paid or credited to a contract holder to the extent that such amount exceeds the minimum rate of interest required to be credited with respect to contract values under local law.

(4) *Account balance or value.* This paragraph (b)(4) provides rules for determining the balance or value of a financial account for purposes of chapter 4. For example, the rules of this paragraph apply for purposes of determining whether an FFI meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(2)(i), (f)(2)(ii) or (f)(3) of this section to certify to a deemed-compliant FFI status. The rules of this paragraph also apply to a participating FFI's due diligence and reporting obligations to the extent required under § 1.1471-4(c) or (d) and to a U.S. withholding agent's due diligence obligations to the extent required under § 1.1471-3.

(i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section with respect to immediate annuities, the balance or value of a financial account is the balance or value calculated by the financial institution for purposes of reporting to the account holder. In the case of an account described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, the balance or value of an equity interest is the value calculated by the financial institution for the purpose that requires the most frequent determination of value, and the balance or value of a debt interest is its principal amount. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section, the balance or value of an insurance or annuity contract is the balance or value as of either the calendar year end or the most recent contract anniversary date. The balance or value of the account is not to be reduced by any liabilities or obligations incurred by an account holder with respect to the account or any of the assets held in the account and is not to be reduced by any fees, penalties, or other charges for which the account holder may be liable upon terminating, transferring, surrendering, liquidating, or withdrawing cash from the account. Each holder of a jointly held account is attributed the entire balance or value of the joint account. See § 1.1473-1(b)(3) for rules regarding the valuation of trust interests that also apply under this paragraph (b)(4)(i) to determine the value of trust interests that are financial accounts.

(ii) *Special rule for immediate annuity* - (A) *Immediate annuities without minimum benefit guarantees.* If the value of an immediate annuity contract with no minimum benefit guarantee is not reported to the account holder, the account balance or value of the contract is the sum of the net present values on the valuation date of the amounts reasonably expected to be payable in future periods under the contract.

(B) *Immediate annuities with a minimum benefit guarantee.* The account balance or value of an annuity contract with a minimum guarantee is the sum of the net present values on the valuation date of -

(*1*) The non-guaranteed amounts reasonably expected to be payable in future periods; and

(*2*) The guaranteed amounts payable in future periods.

(C) *Net present value of amounts payable in future periods.* The net present value of an amount payable in a future period shall be determined using -

(*1*) A reasonable actuarial valuation method, and

(*2*) The mortality tables and interest rate(s) -

(*i*) Prescribed pursuant to section 7520 and the regulations thereunder; or

(*ii*) Used by the issuer of the contract to determine the amounts payable under the contract.

(iii) *Account aggregation requirements* - (A) *In general.* To the extent a financial institution is required under chapter 4 to determine the aggregate balance or value of an account, the financial institution is required to aggregate the account balance or value of all accounts that are held (in whole or in part) by the same person and that are maintained by the financial institution or members of its expanded affiliated group, but only to the extent that the financial institution's computerized systems link the accounts by reference to a data element, such as client number, EIN, or foreign tax identifying number, and allow the account balances of such accounts to be aggregated. Notwithstanding the rules set forth in this paragraph (b)(4)(iii), a financial institution is required to aggregate the balance or value of accounts that it treats as consolidated obligations.

(B) *Aggregation rule for relationship managers.* To the extent a financial institution is required under chapter 4 to apply the aggregation rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii), the financial institution also is required to aggregate all accounts that a relationship manager knows are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person, as well as all accounts that the relationship manager has associated with one another through a relationship code, customer identification number, TIN, or similar indicator, or that the relationship manager would typically associate with each other under the procedures of the financial institution (or the department, division, or unit with which the relationship manager is associated).

(*C*) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the account aggregation requirements of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii):

Example 1. FFI not required to aggregate accounts for U.S. account exception.A U.S. resident individual, U, holds a depository account with Branch 1 of CB, a commercial bank that is a participating FFI. The balance in U's Branch 1 account at the end of Year 1 is $35,000. U also holds a depository account with Branch 2 of CB, with a $45,000 balance at the end of Year 1. CB's retail banking businesses share computerized information management systems across its branches, but U's accounts are not associated with one another in the shared computerized information system. In addition, CB has not assigned a relationship manager to U or U's accounts. Because the accounts are not associated in CB's system or by a relationship manager, CB is not required to aggregate the accounts under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) and both accounts are eligible for the exception to U.S. account status described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section as neither account exceeds the $50,000 threshold.Example 2. FFI required to aggregate accounts for U.S. account exception.Same facts as *Example 1,* except that both of U's depository accounts are associated with U and with one another by reference to CB's internal identification number. The system shows the account balances for both accounts, and such balances may be electronically aggregated, though the system does not show a combined balance for the accounts. In determining whether such accounts meet the exception to U.S. account status described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for certain depository accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less, CB is required to aggregate the account balances of all depository accounts under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Under those rules, U is treated as holding depository accounts with CB with an aggregate balance of $80,000. Accordingly, neither account is eligible for the exception to U.S. account status, because the accounts, when aggregated, exceed the $50,000 threshold.Example 3. Aggregation rules for joint accounts maintained by a participating FFI.In Year 1, a U.S. resident individual, U, holds a custodial account that is a preexisting account at custodial institution CI, a participating FFI. The balance in U's CI custodial account at the end of Year 1 is $35,000. U also holds a joint custodial account that is a preexisting account with her sister, A, a nonresident alien for U.S. federal income tax purposes, with another custodial institution, CI2. The balance in the joint account at the end of Year 1 is also $35,000. CI and CI2 are part of the same expanded affiliated group and share computerized information management systems. Both U's custodial account at CI and U and A's custodial account at CI2 are associated with U and with one another by reference to CI's internal identification number and the system allows the balances to be aggregated. In determining whether such accounts meet the documentation exception described in § 1.1471-4(c)(4)(iv) for certain preexisting individual accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less, CI is required to aggregate the account balances of accounts held in whole or in part by the same account holder under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Under those rules, U is treated as having financial accounts with C1 and CI2, each with an aggregate balance of $70,000. Accordingly, neither account is eligible for the documentation exception.Example 4. Aggregation for applying indefinite validity periods.In Year 1, an owner-documented FFI, O, holds an offshore account with Branch 1 of CB, a commercial bank that is a U.S. withholding agent. The balance in O's CB account at the end of Year 1 is $600,000. In Year 1, O also holds an account in the United States with Branch 2 of CB. The Branch 2 account has a $450,000 balance at the end of Year 1. CB's banking businesses share computerized information management systems across its branches. O's accounts are associated with one another in the shared computerized information system and the system allows the balances to be aggregated. In determining whether CB is permitted to apply an indefinite validity period for the documentation submitted for O's account at Branch 1 pursuant to § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(C)(*4*) (permitting indefinite validity for a withholding statement of an owner-documented FFI if the balance or value of all accounts held by the owner-documented FFI does not exceed $1,000,000), CB is required to aggregate the account balance of O's accounts at Branch 1 and Branch 2 to the extent required under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, O is treated as holding financial accounts with CB with an aggregate balance of $1,050,000 and the documentation submitted for O's account at Branch 1 is not eligible for the indefinite validity period described under § 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(C)(*4*).

(iv) *Currency translation of balance or value.* If the balance or value of a financial account, other obligation, or the aggregate amount payable under a group life or group annuity contract described in § 1.1471-4(c)(4) is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, a withholding agent must calculate the balance or value by applying a spot rate determined under § 1.988-1(d) to translate such balance or value into the U.S. dollar equivalent. For the purpose of a participating or registered deemed-compliant FFI reporting an account under § 1.1471-4(d), the spot rate must be determined as of the last day of the calendar year (or, in the case of an insurance contract or annuity contract, the most recent contract anniversary date, when applicable) for which the account is being reported or, if the account was closed during such calendar year, the date the account was closed. In the case of an FFI determining whether an account meets (or continues to meet) a preexisting account documentation exception described in § 1.1471-4(c)(3)(iii) or (c)(5)(iii), or whether the account is an account described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the spot rate must be determined on the date for which the FFI is determining the threshold amount as prescribed in those provisions.

(5) *Account maintained by financial institution.* A custodial account is maintained by the financial institution that holds custody over the assets in the account (including a financial institution that holds assets in street name for an account holder in such institution). A depository account is maintained by the financial institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the account (excluding an agent of a financial institution regardless of whether such agent is a financial institution under paragraph (e)(1) of this section). Any equity or debt interest in a financial institution that constitutes a financial account under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is maintained by such financial institution. A cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section is maintained by the financial institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to the contract.

(c) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(c).

(d) *Definition of FFI.* The term *FFI* means, with respect to any entity that is not resident in a country that has in effect a Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA, any financial institution (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) that is a foreign entity. With respect to any entity that is resident in a country that has in effect a Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA, an FFI is any entity that is treated as a Financial Institution pursuant to such Model 1 IGA or Model 2 IGA.

(v) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (e)(4) of this section:

Example 1. Investment advisor.Fund Manager is an investment entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Fund Manager, among its various business operations, organizes and manages a variety of funds, including Fund A, a fund that invests primarily in equities. Fund Manager hires Investment Advisor, a foreign entity, to provide advice and discretionary management of a portion of the financial assets held by Fund A. Investment Advisor earned more than 50% of its gross income for the last three years from providing similar services. Because Investment Advisor primarily conducts a business of managing financial assets on behalf of clients, Investment Advisor is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section and an FFI under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.Example 2. Entity that is managed by an FFI.The facts are the same as in *Example 1.* In addition, in every year since it was organized, Fund A has earned more than 50% of its gross income from investing in financial assets. Accordingly, Fund A is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section because it is managed by Fund Manager and Investment Advisor and its gross income is primarily attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets.Example 3. Investment manager.Investment Manager, a U.S. entity, is an investment entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Investment Manager organizes and registers Fund A in Country A. Investment Manager is authorized to facilitate purchases and sales of financial assets held by Fund A in accordance with Fund A's investment strategy. In every year since it was organized, Fund A has earned more than 50% of its gross income from investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets. Accordingly, Fund A is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section and an FFI under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.Example 4. Foreign real estate investment fund that is managed by an FFI.The facts are the same as in *Example 3,* except that Fund A's assets consist solely of non-debt, direct interests in real property located within and without the United States. Fund A is not an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, even though it is managed by Investment Manager, because less than 50% of its gross income is attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets.Example 5. Trust managed by an individual.On January 1, 2013, X, an individual, establishes Trust A, a nongrantor foreign trust for the benefit of X's children, Y and Z. X appoints Trustee A, an individual, to act as the trustee of Trust A. Trust A's assets consists solely of financial assets, and its income consists solely of income from those financial assets. Pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, Trustee A manages and administers the assets of the trust. Trustee A does not hire any entity as a third-party service provider to perform any of the activities described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Trust A is not an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section because it is managed solely by Trustee A, an individual.Example 6. Trust managed by a trust company.The facts are the same as in *Example 5,* except that X hires Trust Company, an FFI, to act as trustee on behalf of Trust A. As trustee, Trust Company manages and administers the assets of Trust A in accordance with the terms of the trust instrument for the benefit of Y and Z. Because Trust A is managed by an FFI, Trust A is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section and an FFI under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.Example 7.[Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(e)(4)(v), *Example 7.*Example 8.[Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(e)(4)(v), *Example 8.*

Within six months of the identification of any account described in this paragraph, the FFI transfers the account to an affiliate that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or U.S. financial institution, closes the account, or becomes a participating FFI.

(*3*) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(1)(i)(B)(*3*).

(C) *Qualified collective investment vehicles.* An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(C) if it meets the following requirements.

(*1*) The FFI is an FFI solely because it is an investment entity, and it is regulated as an investment fund either in its country of incorporation or organization or in all of the countries in which it is registered and all of the countries in which it operates. A fund will be considered to be regulated as an investment fund under this paragraph if its manager is regulated with respect to the investment fund in all of the countries in which the investment fund is registered and in all of the countries in which the investment fund operates.

(*2*) Interests issued directly by the fund are redeemed by or transferred by the fund rather than sold by investors on any secondary market. Notwithstanding the prior sentence, an FFI will not be prohibited from qualifying as a restricted fund solely because it issued interests in bearer form provided that the FFI ceased issuing interests in bearer form after December 31, 2012, retires all such interests upon surrender, and establishes policies and procedures to redeem or immobilize all such interests prior to January 1, 2017, and that prior to payment the FFI documents the account holder in accordance with the procedures set forth in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to accounts other than preexisting accounts and agrees to withhold and report on such accounts as would be required under § 1.1471-4(b) and (d) if it were a participating FFI. For purposes of this paragraph (f)(1)(i)(D), interests in the FFI that are issued by the fund through a transfer agent or distributor that does not hold the interests as a nominee of the account holder will be considered to have been issued directly by the fund.

(*3*) Interests that are not issued directly by the fund are sold only through distributors that are participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, nonregistering local banks described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, or restricted distributors described in paragraph (f)(4) of this section.

(*vii*) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(1)(i)(F)(*3*)(*vii*).

(*4*) The IRS may revoke a sponsoring entity's status as a sponsor with respect to all sponsored FFIs if there is a material failure by the sponsoring entity to comply with its obligations under paragraph (f)(1)(i)(F)(*3*) of this section with respect to any sponsored FFI.

(*5*) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(1)(i)(F)(*5*).

(ii) *Procedural requirements for registered deemed-compliant FFIs.* A registered deemed-compliant FFI described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section may use one or more agents to perform the necessary due diligence to identify its account holders and to take any required action associated with obtaining and maintaining its deemed-compliant status. The FFI, however, remains responsible for ensuring that the requirements for its deemed-compliant status are met. Unless otherwise provided in this section, a registered deemed-compliant FFI described in paragraph (f)(1)(i)(A) through (E) of this section is required to -

(A) Register with the IRS pursuant to procedures prescribed by the IRS and agree to comply with the terms of its registered deemed-compliant status.

(B) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(1)(ii)(B).

(C) Maintain in its records the confirmation from the IRS of the FFI's registration as a deemed-compliant FFI and GIIN or such other information as the IRS specifies in forms or other guidance; and

(D) Agree to notify the IRS if there is a change in circumstances that would make the FFI ineligible for the deemed-compliant status for which it has registered, and to do so within six months of the change in circumstances unless the FFI is able to resume its eligibility for its registered-deemed compliant status within the six month notification period.

(iii) *Deemed-compliant FFI that is merged or acquired.* A deemed-compliant FFI that becomes a participating FFI or a member of a participating FFI group as a result of a merger or acquisition will not be required to redetermine the chapter 4 status of any account maintained by the FFI prior to the date of the merger or acquisition unless that account has a subsequent change in circumstances.

(2) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(2).

(i) *Nonregistering local bank.* An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(2)(i) if the FFI meets the following requirements.

(*1*) A bank; or

(*2*) A credit union or similar cooperative credit organization that is operated without profit.

(B) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(2)(i)(B).

(C) The FFI does not have a fixed place of business outside its country of incorporation or organization. For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions.

(D) The FFI does not solicit customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization. For this purpose, an FFI will not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization merely because it operates a Web site, provided that the Web site does not permit account opening, does not indicate that the FFI maintains accounts for or provides services to nonresidents, and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S. customers or account holders. An FFI will also not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization merely because it advertises in print media or on a radio or television station that is distributed or aired primarily within its country of incorporation or organization but is also incidentally distributed or aired in other countries, provided that the advertisement does not indicate that the FFI maintains accounts for or provides services to nonresidents and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S. customers or account holders.

(E) The FFI does not have more than $175 million in assets on its balance sheet and, if the FFI is a member of an expanded affiliated group, the group does not have more than $500 million in total assets on its consolidated or combined balance sheets.

(F) With respect to an FFI that is part of an expanded affiliated group, each member of the expanded affiliated group is incorporated or organized in the same country and does not have a fixed place of business outside of that country. For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions. Further, each FFI in the group, other than an FFI described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section or § 1.1471-6(f), meets the requirements set forth in this paragraph (f)(2)(i). For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions.

(ii) *FFIs with only low-value accounts.* An FFI is described in this paragraph (f)(2)(ii) if the FFI meets the following requirements:

(A) The FFI is not an investment entity.

(B) No financial account maintained by the FFI (or, in the case of an FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group, by any member of the expanded affiliated group) has a balance or value in excess of $50,000. The balance or value of a financial account shall be determined by applying the rules described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, substituting the term *financial account* for the term *depository account* and the term *person* for the term *individual.*

(C) The FFI does not have more than $50 million in assets on its balance sheet as of the end of its most recent accounting year. In the case of an FFI that is a member of an expanded affiliated group, the entire expanded affiliated group does not have more than $50 million in assets on its consolidated or combined balance sheet as of the end of its most recent accounting year.

(iii) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(2)(iii) through (f)(2)(iii)(E).

(iv) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(2)(iv) through (f)(2)(iv)(E).

(F) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(2)(iv)(F).

(v) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(2)(v) through (f)(2)(v)(B).

(3) *Owner-documented FFIs* - (i) *In general.* An owner-documented FFI means an FFI that meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(3)(ii) of this section. An FFI may only be treated as an owner-documented FFI with respect to payments received from and accounts held with a designated withholding agent (or with respect to payments received from and accounts held with another FFI that is also treated as an owner-documented FFI by such designated withholding agent). A designated withholding agent is a U.S. financial institution, participating FFI, or reporting Model 1 FFI that agrees to undertake the additional due diligence and reporting required under paragraphs (f)(3)(ii)(D) and (E) of this section in order to treat the FFI as an owner-documented FFI. An FFI meeting the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3) will only be treated as a deemed-compliant FFI with respect to a payment or account for which it does not act as an intermediary.

(ii) *Requirements of owner-documented FFI status.* An FFI meets the requirements of this paragraph (f)(3)(ii) only if -

(A) The FFI is an FFI solely because it is an investment entity;

(B) The FFI is not owned by or in an expanded affiliated group with any FFI that is a depository institution, custodial institution, or specified insurance company;

(C) The FFI does not maintain a financial account for any nonparticipating FFI;

(D) The FFI provides the designated withholding agent with all of the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d)(6) and agrees to notify the withholding agent if there is a change in circumstances; and

(E) The designated withholding agent agrees to report to the IRS (or, in the case of a reporting Model 1 FFI, to the relevant foreign government or agency thereof) all of the information described in § 1.1471-4(d) or § 1.1474-1(i) (as appropriate) with respect to any specified U.S. persons that are identified in § 1.1471-3(d)(6)(iv)(A)(*1*) and (*2*). Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the designated withholding agent is not required to report information with respect to an indirect owner of the FFI that holds its interest through a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI (other than an owner-documented FFI), an entity that is a U.S. person, an exempt beneficial owner, or an excepted NFFE.

(4) *Definition of a restricted distributor.* An entity is a restricted distributor for purposes of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(D) of this section (relating to registered deemed-compliant restricted funds) if it operates as a distributor that holds debt or equity interests in a restricted fund as a nominee and meets the following requirements.

(i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(f)(4)(i).

(ii) The distributor is required to perform AML due diligence procedures under the anti-money laundering laws of its country of incorporation or organization (which must be a FATF-compliant jurisdiction).

(iii) The distributor operates solely in its country of incorporation or organization, does not have a fixed place of business outside that country, and, if such distributor belongs to an expanded affiliated group, has the same country of incorporation or organization as all other members of its expanded affiliated group. For this purpose, a fixed place of business does not include a location that is not advertised to the public and from which the FFI performs solely administrative support functions.

(iv) The distributor does not solicit customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization. For this purpose, a distributor will not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of organization merely because it operates a Web site, provided that the Web site does not permit account opening by persons identified as nonresidents, does not specifically state that nonresidents may acquire securities from the distributor, and does not otherwise target U.S. customers or account holders. A distributor will also not be considered to have solicited customers or account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization merely because it advertises in print media or on a radio or television station that is distributed or aired primarily within its country of incorporation or organization but is also incidentally distributed or aired in other countries, provided that the advertisement does not indicate that the distributor maintains accounts for or provides services to nonresidents and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S. customers or account holders.

(v) The distributor does not have more than $175 million in total assets under management and has no more than $7 million in gross revenue on its income statement for the most recent financial accounting year and, if the distributor belongs to an expanded affiliated group, the entire group does not have more than $500 million in total assets under management or more than $20 million in gross revenue for its most recent financial accounting year on a combined or consolidated income statement.

(vi) The distributor provides the restricted fund (or another distributor of the restricted fund that is a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, and with which the distributor has entered into its distribution agreement) with a valid Form W-8 indicating that the distributor satisfies the requirements to be a restricted distributor.

(vii) The agreement governing the distributor's distribution of debt or equity interests of the restricted fund -

(A) Prohibits the distributor from distributing any securities to specified U.S. persons, passive NFFEs that have one or more substantial U.S. owners, and nonparticipating FFIs;

(B) Requires that if the distributor does distribute securities to any of the persons described in this paragraph (f)(4)(vii), it will cause the restricted fund to redeem or retire those interests, or it will transfer those interests to a distributor that is a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI, within six months and the commission paid to the distributor will be forfeited to the restricted fund or to the participating FFI to which those interests are transferred; and

(C) Requires the distributor to notify the restricted fund (or another distributor of the restricted fund that is a participating FFI, reporting Model 1 FFI, or registered deemed-compliant FFI and with which the distributor has entered into its distribution agreement) of a change in the distributor's chapter 4 status within 90 days of the change in status.

(viii) With respect to sales after December 31, 2011, and prior to the time the restrictions described in paragraph (f)(4)(vii) of this section were incorporated into the distribution agreement, either the agreement governing the distributor's distribution of debt or equity interests of the relevant FFI contained a prohibition of the sale of such securities to U.S. entities or U.S. resident individuals, or the distributor reviews all accounts relating to such sales in accordance with the procedures (and time frames) described in § 1.1471-4(c) applicable to preexisting accounts and certifies that it has caused the restricted fund to redeem or retire, or it has transferred all securities sold to any of the persons described in paragraph (f)(4)(vii) of this section. If the distribution agreement addressed in the prior sentence contained only a prohibition on the sale of securities to U.S. resident individuals, the distributor will not be required to review the individual accounts relating to such sales but must review and make certifications with respect to all entity accounts in the manner described in the previous sentence.

(g) *Recalcitrant account holders* - (1) *Scope.* This paragraph (g) provides rules for determining when an account holder of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI is a recalcitrant account holder. Paragraph (g)(2) of this section defines the term recalcitrant account holder. Paragraphs (g)(3) and (4) of this section provide timing rules for when an account holder will begin to be treated as a recalcitrant account holder by a participating FFI and when an account holder will cease to be treated as a recalcitrant account holder by such institution. For rules for determining the holder of an account, see paragraph (a)(3) of this section. For the withholding requirements of an FFI with respect to its recalcitrant account holders, see paragraph (f) of this section and § 1.1471-4(b). For the reporting requirements of an FFI with respect to its recalcitrant account holders, see § 1.1471-4(d)(6), and, for the reporting required with respect to payments made to such account holders, see § 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii). The rules provided in this paragraph (g) to classify certain account holders as recalcitrant account holders shall not, however, apply to a U.S. branch of a participating FFI. Instead, a U.S. branch of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is treated as a U.S. person shall apply the presumption rules of § 1.1471-3(f) (for foreign entity account holders) and chapter 3 or 61 (for individual payees) to determine the status of a payee if it cannot reliably associate a reportable payment made to the payee with valid documentation.

(2) *Recalcitrant account holder.* The term *recalcitrant account holder* means any holder of an account maintained by an FFI if such account holder is not an FFI (or presumed to be an FFI under § 1.1471-3(f)), the account does not meet the requirements of the exception to U.S. account status described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section (for depository accounts with a balance of $50,000 or less) and does not qualify for any of the exceptions from the documentation requirements described in § 1.1471-4(c)(3)(iii), (c)(4)(iii), (c)(5)(iii), (c)(5)(iv)(E) (or the participating FFI elects to forego such exceptions) and -

(i) The account holder fails to comply with requests by the FFI for the documentation or information that is required under § 1.1471-4(c) for determining the status of such account as a U.S. account or other than a U.S. account;

(ii) The account holder fails to provide a valid Form W-9 upon request from the FFI or fails to provide a correct name and TIN combination upon request from the FFI when the FFI has received notice from the IRS indicating that the name and TIN combination reported by the FFI for the account holder is incorrect;

(iii) If foreign law would (but for a waiver) prevent reporting by the FFI (or branch or division thereof) of the information described in § 1.1471-4(d)(3) or (5) with respect to such account, the account holder (or substantial U.S. owner of an account holder that is a U.S. owned foreign entity) fails to provide a valid and effective waiver to permit such reporting; or

(iv) The account holder provides the documentation described in § 1.1471-3(d)(12) to establish its status as a passive NFFE (other than a WP or WT) but fails to provide the information regarding its owners required under § 1.1471-3(d)(12)(iii).

(3) *Start of recalcitrant account holder status* - (i) *Preexisting accounts identified under the procedures described in § 1.1471-4(c) for identifying U. S. accounts* - (A) *In general.* An account holder of a preexisting account described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section maintained by a participating FFI will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder beginning on the dates provided in paragraphs (g)(3)(B) through (D) of this section. An account holder of a preexisting account described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section that is maintained by a registered deemed-compliant FFI will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder beginning on the dates provided in paragraph (f) of this section (setting forth the time by which the FFI must identify its accounts in accordance with the requirements of § 1.1471-4(c) in order to meet the requirements of its applicable registered deemed-compliant status).

(B) *Accounts other than high-value accounts.* Account holders of preexisting accounts maintained by a participating FFI that are not high-value accounts (as described in § 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(D)) and that are described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section will be treated as recalcitrant account holders beginning on the date that is two years after the effective date of the FFI agreement.

(C) *High-value accounts.* Account holders of preexisting accounts maintained by a participating FFI that are high-value accounts (as described in § 1.1471-4(c)(5)(iv)(D)) and that are described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section will be treated as recalcitrant account holders beginning on the date that is one year after the effective date of the FFI agreement.

(D) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(g)(3)(i)(D).

(ii) *Accounts that are not preexisting accounts and accounts requiring name/TIN correction.* An account holder of an account other than a preexisting account and that is described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder beginning on the date that is the earlier of 90 days after the account is opened by the participating FFI or the date that a withholdable payment that is subject to withholding under § 1.1441-2(a) is made to the account. An account holder for which the participating FFI received a notice from the IRS indicating that the name and TIN combination provided for the account holder is incorrect will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder following the date of such notice within the time prescribed in § 31.3406(d)-5(a) of this chapter.

(iii) *Accounts with changes in circumstances.* An account holder holding an account that is described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section following a change in circumstances (other than a change in account balance or value in a subsequent year that causes an individual account to be identified as a high-value account) will be treated as a recalcitrant account holder beginning on the date that is 90 days after the change in circumstances. For the definition of a change in circumstances with respect to an account, see § 1.1471-4(c)(2)(iii).

(4) *End of recalcitrant account holder status.* An account holder that is treated as a recalcitrant account holder under paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section will cease to be so treated as of the date on which the account holder is no longer described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

(h) *Passthru payment* - (1) *Defined.* The term *passthru payment* means any withholdable payment and any foreign passthru payment.

(2) *Foreign passthru payment.* [Reserved]

(i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1471-5T(i) through (i)(10).
