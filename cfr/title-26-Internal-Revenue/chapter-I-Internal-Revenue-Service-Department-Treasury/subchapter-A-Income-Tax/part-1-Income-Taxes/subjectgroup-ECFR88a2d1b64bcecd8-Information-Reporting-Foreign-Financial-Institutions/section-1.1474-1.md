##### § 1.1474-1 Liability for withheld tax and withholding agent reporting. #####

(a) *Payment and returns of tax withheld* - (1) *In general.* A withholding agent is required to deposit any tax withheld pursuant to chapter 4 as provided under paragraph (b) of this section and to make the returns prescribed by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. When several persons qualify as withholding agents with respect to a single payment, only one tax is required to be withheld and deposited.

(2) *Withholding agent liability.* A withholding agent that is required to withhold with respect to a payment under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b) (in the case of a participating FFI), or 1.1472-1(b) but fails either to withhold or to deposit any tax withheld as required under paragraph (b) of this section is liable for the amount of tax not withheld and deposited.

(3) *Use of agents* - (i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (a)(3), a withholding agent may authorize an agent to fulfill its obligations under chapter 4. The acts of an agent of a withholding agent (including the receipt of withholding certificates, the payment of amounts subject to withholding, the withholding and deposit of tax withheld, and the reporting required on the relevant form) are imputed to the withholding agent on whose behalf it is acting.

(ii) *Authorized agent.* An agent is authorized only if -

(A) There is a written agreement between the withholding agent and the person acting as agent;

(B) A Form 8655, “Reporting Agent Authorization,” is filed with the IRS if the agent (including any sub-agent) is acting as a reporting agent for filing Form 1042 or making tax deposits and payments;

(C) Books and records and relevant personnel of the agent (including any sub-agent) are available to the withholding agent (on a continuous basis, including after termination of the relationship) in order to evaluate the withholding agent's compliance with the provisions of chapter 4; and

(D) The withholding agent remains fully liable for the acts of its agent (or any sub-agent) and does not assert any of the defenses that may otherwise be available, including under common law principles of agency, in order to avoid tax liability under the Code.

(iii) *Liability of withholding agent acting through an agent.* A withholding agent acting through an agent is liable for any failure of the agent, such as a failure to withhold an amount or make a payment of tax, in the same manner and to the same extent as if the agent's failure had been the failure of the withholding agent. For this purpose, the agent's actual knowledge or reason to know shall be imputed to the withholding agent. Except as otherwise provided in the QI, WP, or WT agreement, an agent of a withholding agent is subject to the same withholding and reporting obligations that apply to any withholding agent under the provisions of chapter 4 and does not benefit from the special procedures or exceptions that apply to a QI, WP, or WT. If the agent is a foreign person, however, a U.S. withholding agent may treat the acts of the foreign agent as its own for purposes of determining whether it has complied with the provisions of chapter 4. The withholding agent's liability under paragraph (a)(2) of this section will exist even if the agent is also a withholding agent and is itself separately liable for failure to comply with the provisions of chapter 4. The same tax, interest, or penalties, however, shall not be collected more than once.

(4) *Liability for failure to obtain documentation timely or to act in accordance with applicable presumptions* - (i) *In general.* A withholding agent that cannot reliably associate a payment with documentation on the date of payment and that does not withhold under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b), or withholds at less than the 30 percent rate prescribed, is liable under this section for the tax required to be withheld under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b) (including interest, penalties, or additions to tax otherwise applicable in respect of the failure to deduct and withhold) unless -

(A) The withholding agent has appropriately relied on the presumptions described in § 1.1471-3(f) in order to treat the payment as exempt from withholding; or

(B) The withholding agent obtained after the date of payment valid documentation that meets the requirements of § 1.1471-3(c)(7) to establish that the payment was, in fact, exempt from withholding.

(ii) *Withholding satisfied by another withholding agent.* If a withholding agent fails to deduct and withhold any amount required to be deducted and withheld under § 1.1471-2(a), 1.1471-4(b), or 1.1472-1(b), and the tax is satisfied by another withholding agent or is otherwise paid, then the amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld shall not be collected from the first-mentioned withholding agent. However, the withholding agent is not relieved from liability in any such case for any interest or penalties or additions to tax otherwise applicable in respect of the failure to deduct and withhold.

(b) *Payment of withheld tax* - (1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (b), every withholding agent who withholds tax pursuant to chapter 4 shall deposit such tax within the time provided in § 1.6302-2(a) by electronic funds transfer as provided under § 31.6302-1(h) of this chapter. If for any reason the total amount of tax required to be deposited for any calendar year pursuant to the income tax return described in paragraph (c) of this section has not been deposited pursuant to § 1.6302-2, the withholding agent shall pay the balance of such tax due for such year at such place as the IRS shall specify. The tax shall be paid when filing the return described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for such year, unless the IRS specifies otherwise. See § 1.1471-4(b)(6) for the special rule allowing participating FFIs to set aside in escrow amounts withheld with respect to dormant accounts.

(2) *Special rule for foreign passthru payments and payments of gross proceeds that include an undetermined amount of income subject to tax.* [Reserved]

(c) *Income tax return* - (1) *In general.* Every withholding agent shall file an income tax return on Form 1042, “Annual Withholding Tax Return for U.S. Source Income of Foreign Persons,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) to report chapter 4 reportable amounts (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section). This income tax return shall be filed on the same income tax return used to report amounts subject to reporting for chapter 3 purposes as described in § 1.1461-1(b). The return must show the aggregate amount of payments that are chapter 4 reportable amounts and must report the tax withheld for the preceding calendar year by the withholding agent, in addition to any information required by the form and its accompanying instructions. Withholding certificates and other statements or information provided to a withholding agent are not required to be attached to the return. A Form 1042 must be filed under this paragraph (c)(1) even if no tax was required to be withheld for chapter 4 purposes during the preceding calendar year. The withholding agent must retain a copy of Form 1042 for the applicable period of limitations on assessment and collection with respect to the amounts required to be reported on the Form 1042. See section 6501 and the regulations thereunder for the applicable period of limitations. Adjustments to the total amount of tax withheld described in § 1.1474-2 shall be stated on the return as prescribed by the form and its accompanying instructions.

(2) *Participating FFIs, registered deemed-compliant FFIs, and U.S. branches treated as U.S. persons.* A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI shall file Form 1042 in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section to report chapter 4 reportable amounts for which the participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI is required to file Form 1042-S, as described in paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section. A participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI with a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person must exclude from Form 1042 payments made and taxes withheld by such U.S. branch. A U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person shall file a separate Form 1042 in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the instructions on the form to report chapter 4 reportable amounts.

(3) *Amended returns.* An amended return under this paragraph (c)(3) must be filed on Form 1042. An amended return must include such information as the form or its accompanying instructions shall require, including, with respect to any information that has changed from the time of the filing of the return, the information that was shown on the original return and the corrected information.

(d) *Information returns for payment reporting* - (1) *Filing requirement* - (i) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1T(d)(1)(i).

(ii) *Recipient* - (A) *Defined.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, the term *recipient* under this paragraph (d) means a person that is a recipient of a chapter 4 reportable amount, and includes -

(*x*) An exempt beneficial owner of a payment, including when the payment is made to such owner through an FFI (including a nonparticipating FFI) that provides documentation and information sufficient for a withholding agent to determine the portion of the payment allocable to such owner; and

(*xi*) Any person (including a flow-through entity) or U.S. branch of a participating FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI receiving such income that is (or is deemed to be) effectively connected with the conduct of its trade or business in the United States;

(*iii*) A participating FFI or a registered deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT (including a U.S. branch of a participating FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person) to the extent it provides its withholding agent with sufficient information to allocate the payment to its account holders and payees that are exempt from withholding under chapter 4;

(*iv*) An account holder or payee of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI (including an account holder or payee of a U.S. branch of such FFI that is not treated as a U.S. person) that is included in the FFI's reporting pools described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section;

(ii) *Exception to reporting.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(2)(ii), a chapter 4 reportable amount does not include an amount paid to a U.S. person if the withholding agent treats such U.S. person as a payee for purposes of determining whether withholding is required under §§ 1.1471-2 and 1.1472-1. A chapter 4 reportable amount does, however, include an amount paid to a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI to the extent allocable to its reporting pool of payees that are U.S. persons as described in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section.

(iii) *Coordination with chapter 3.* A payment that is not subject to reporting under this paragraph (d)(2) may be subject to chapter 3 reporting on Form 1042-S to the extent provided on such form and its accompanying instructions or under § 1.1461-1(c)(2). The recipient information and other information required to be reported on Form 1042-S for purposes of chapter 4 shall be in addition to the information required to be provided on Form 1042-S for purposes of chapter 3.

(iv) The name and address of the recipient and its TIN or GIIN (as applicable) and foreign taxpayer identification number and date of birth (as required on the instructions to the form);

(v) In the case of a payment to a person (including a flow-through entity or U.S. branch) for which the payment is reported as effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business in the United States or, in the case of a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person, the EIN used by the person or U.S. branch to file its U.S. income tax returns;

(vi) The name, address of any FFI, flow-through entity that is an NFFE, or U.S. branch or territory financial institution that is not treated as a U.S. person when an account holder or owner of such entity (including an unknown recipient or owner) is treated as the recipient of the payment;

(4) *Method of reporting* - (i) *Payments by U.S. withholding agent to recipients.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(4) or on the Form 1042-S and its accompanying instructions, a withholding agent that is a U.S. person (including a U.S. branch that is treated as a U.S. person and excluding a foreign branch of a U.S. person that is a QI) and that makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount must file a separate form for each recipient that receives such amount. Except as otherwise provided on Form 1042-S or its instructions, only payments for which the income or payment code, exemption code, withholding rate, and recipient code are the same may be reported on a single form filed with the IRS. See paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section for reporting of payments made to a person that is not a recipient and that is otherwise required to be reported on Form 1042-S.

(A) *Payments to certain entities that are beneficial owners.* If the beneficial owner of a payment made by a U.S. withholding agent is an exempt beneficial owner, an FFI, an NFFE, or a territory entity, it must complete Form 1042-S treating such entity as the recipient of the payment.

(B) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1T(d)(4)(i)(B).

(C) *Amounts paid to a U.S. branch of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI.* A U.S. withholding agent making a payment of U.S. source FDAP income to a U.S. branch of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI shall complete Form 1042-S as follows -

(*1*) If the U.S. branch is treated as a U.S. person, if the withholding agent treats amounts paid as effectively connected with the conduct of the branch's trade or business in the United States, or if the U.S. branch is the beneficial owner of the payment, the withholding agent must file Form 1042-S reporting the U.S. branch as the recipient;

(*2*) If the U.S. branch of a participating FFI is not treated as a U.S. person and provides the withholding agent with a withholding certificate that transmits information regarding its reporting pools referenced in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section or information regarding each recipient that is an account holder or payee of the U.S. branch, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to the U.S. branch for each such pool to the extent required on the form and its accompanying instructions or must complete a separate Form 1042-S issued to each recipient whose documentation is associated with the U.S. branch's withholding certificate as described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and report the U.S. branch as an entity not treated as a recipient; or

(*3*) If the U.S. branch of a participating FFI is not treated as a U.S. person, to the extent its fails to provide sufficient information regarding its account holders or payees, the withholding agent shall report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient to the extent recipient information is not provided and report the U.S. branch as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.

(D) *Amounts paid to territory financial institutions that are flow-through entities or acting as intermediaries.* A U.S. withholding agent making a withholdable payment to a territory financial institution that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary must complete Form 1042-S as follows -

(*1*) If the territory financial institution is treated as a U.S. person or is the beneficial owner of the payment, the withholding agent must file Form 1042-S treating the territory financial institution as the recipient;

(*2*) If the territory financial institution is not treated as a U.S. person and provides the withholding agent with a withholding certificate that transmits information regarding each recipient that is an partner, beneficiary, owner, account holder, or payee, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient whose documentation is associated with the territory financial institution's withholding certificate as described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and must report the territory financial institution under that paragraph; or

(*3*) If the territory financial institution is not treated as a U.S. person, to the extent its fails to provide sufficient information regarding its partners, beneficiaries, owners, account holders or payees, the withholding agent shall report the recipient of the payment as an unknown recipient and report the territory financial institution as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) of this section for an entity not treated as a recipient.

(E) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1T(d)(4)(i)(E).

(ii) *Payments made by withholding agents to certain entities that are not recipients* - (A) *Entities that provide information for a withholding agent to perform specific payee reporting.* If a U.S. withholding agent makes a payment of a chapter 4 reportable amount to a flow-through entity that is a passive NFFE, a nonparticipating FFI receiving a payment on behalf of an exempt beneficial owner, or a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI that is an NQI, NWP, or NWT, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (d)(4)(i)(B) of this section, the withholding agent must complete a separate Form 1042-S for each recipient that is a partner, beneficiary, owner, or account holder of such entity to the extent the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation (under the rules of § 1.1471-3(c) and (d)) provided by such entity, as applicable, with respect to each such recipient. If a payment is made through tiers of such entities, the withholding agent must nevertheless complete Form 1042-S for the recipient to the extent it can reliably associate the payment with documentation provided with respect to that recipient. A withholding agent that is completing a Form 1042-S for a recipient described in this paragraph (d)(4)(ii)(A) must include on the form the information described in paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section for the entity through which the recipient directly receives the payment.

(B) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1T(d)(4)(ii)(B).

(iii) *Reporting by participating FFIs and deemed-compliant FFIs (including QIs, WPs, and WTs)* - (A) [Reserved] For further guidance, see § 1.1474-1T(d)(4)(iii) through (d)(4)(iii)(C).

(iv) *Reporting by territory financial institutions.* A territory financial institution that is not treated as a U.S. person will not be required to report on Form 1042-S if another withholding agent has reported the same amount with regard to the same recipient for which such entity would otherwise be required to file a return under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) and such withholding agent has withheld the entire amount required to be withheld from such payment. A territory financial institution must, however, report payments made to recipients for whom it has failed to provide the appropriate documentation to another withholding agent or to the extent it knows, or has reason to know, that less than the required amount has been withheld. A territory financial institution that is treated as a U.S. person or is otherwise required under this paragraph (d)(4)(iv) to report amounts paid to recipients on Forms 1042-S must report in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent.

(v) *Nonparticipating FFIs.* A nonparticipating FFI that is a flow-through entity or that acts as an intermediary with respect to a payment may file Forms 1042 and 1042-S only to report and allocate tax withheld to the account holders, partners, owners, or beneficiaries of the nonparticipating FFI.

(vi) *Other withholding agents.* Any person that is a withholding agent that is not described in any of paragraphs (d)(4)(i) through (v) of this section shall file Forms 1042-S in the same manner as a U.S. withholding agent and in accordance with the instructions to the form.

(e) *Magnetic media reporting.* A withholding agent that is not a financial institution and that is required to file 250 or more Form 1042-S information returns for a taxable year must file Form 1042-S returns on magnetic media. See § 301.6011-2(b) of this chapter for the requirements of a withholding agent that is not a financial institution with respect to the filing of Forms 1042-S on magnetic media. See § 301.1474-1(a) of this chapter for the requirements applicable to a withholding agent that is a financial institution with respect to the filing of Forms 1042-S on magnetic media.

(f) *Indemnification of withholding agent.* A withholding agent is indemnified against the claims and demands of any person for the amount of any tax it deducts and withholds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder. A withholding agent that withholds based on a reasonable belief that such withholding is required under chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder is treated for purposes of section 1474 and this paragraph (f) as having withheld tax in accordance with the provisions of chapter 4 and the regulations thereunder. This paragraph (f) does not relieve a withholding agent from tax liability under chapter 3 or chapter 4 or the regulations under those chapters.

(g) *Extensions of time to file Forms 1042 and 1042-S.* The IRS may grant an extension of time to file Form 1042 or 1042-S as described in § 1.1461-1(g).

(h) *Penalties.* For penalties and additions to tax for failure to file returns or file and furnish statements in accordance with this section, see sections 6651, 6662, 6663, 6721, 6722, 6723, 6724(c), 7201, 7203, and the regulations under those sections. For penalties and additions to tax for failure to timely pay the tax required to be withheld under chapter 4, see sections 6656, 6672, 7202, and the regulations under those sections.
