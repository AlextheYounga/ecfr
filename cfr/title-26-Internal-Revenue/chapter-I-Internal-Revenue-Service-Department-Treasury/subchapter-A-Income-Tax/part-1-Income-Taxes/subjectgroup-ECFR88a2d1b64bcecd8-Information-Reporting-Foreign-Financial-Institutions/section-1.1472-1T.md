(2) *Payments made to an exempt beneficial owner.* A withholding agent is not required to withhold on a withholdable payment (or portion thereof) under section 1472(a) and paragraph (b) of this section if the withholding agent may treat the payment as made to an exempt beneficial owner.

(3) Definition of *direct reporting NFFE.* A *direct reporting NFFE* means a NFFE that elects to report information about its direct or indirect substantial U.S. owners to the IRS and meets the following requirements -

(i) The NFFE must register on Form 8957, “FATCA Registration,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) with the IRS to obtain a GIIN pursuant to the procedures prescribed by the IRS;

(ii) The NFFE must report directly to the IRS on Form 8966, “FATCA Report,” (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) the following information for each calendar year (or, may be required by the IRS to certify on Form 8966, or in such other manner as the IRS may prescribe, that the NFFE has no substantial U.S. owners):

(A) The name, address, and TIN of each substantial U.S. owner (as defined in § 1.1473-1(b)) of such NFFE;

(B) The total of all payments made to each substantial U.S. owner (including the gross amounts paid or credited to the substantial U.S. owner with respect to such owner's equity interest in the NFFE during the calendar year, which include payments in redemption or liquidation (in whole or part) of the substantial U.S. owner's equity interest in the NFFE);

(C) The value of each substantial U.S. owner's equity interest in the NFFE determined by applying the rules described in § 1.1471-5(b)(4) (substituting the term *equity* for the terms *account* and *financial account*);

(D) The name, address, and GIIN of the NFFE, and

(E) Any other information as required by Form 8966 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) and its accompanying instructions;

(iii) The NFFE must obtain a written certification (contained on a withholding certificate or in a written statement) from each person that would be treated as a substantial U.S. owner of the NFFE if such person were a specified U.S. person. Such written certification must indicate whether the person is a substantial U.S. owner of the NFFE, and if so, the name, address and TIN of the person. If the NFFE has reason to know that such written certification is unreliable or incorrect, it must contact the person and request a revised written certification. If no revised written certification is received, the NFFE must treat the person as a substantial U.S. owner and report on Form 8966 the information required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The NFFE has reason to know that such a written certification is unreliable or incorrect if the certification is inconsistent with information in the NFFE's possession, including information that the NFFE provides to a financial institution in order for the financial institution to meet its AML or other account identification due diligence procedures with respect to the NFFE's account, information that is publicly available, or U.S. indicia as described in § 1.1441-7(b) for which appropriate documentation sufficient to cure the U.S. indicia in the manner set forth in § 1.1441-7(b)(8) has not been obtained.

(iv) The NFFE must keep records that it produces in the ordinary course of its business that summarize the activity (including the gross amounts described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) that are paid or credited to each of its substantial U.S. owners) relating to its transactions with respect to the equity of the NFFE held by each of its substantial U.S. owners for any calendar year in which the owner was required to be reported under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section. The records must be retained for the longer of six years or the retention period under the NFFE's normal business procedures. A NFFE may be required to extend the six year retention period if the IRS requests such an extension prior to the expiration of the six year period;

(v) The NFFE must respond to requests made by the IRS for additional information with respect to any substantial U.S. owner that is subject to reporting by the NFFE or with respect to the records described in paragraphs (c)(3)(iii) or (iv) of this section;

(vi) The NFFE must make a periodic certification to the IRS within each six-month period following the end of each certification period relating to its compliance with respect to the election described in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section. The first certification period begins on the date a GIIN is issued and ends at the close of the third full calendar year following that date. Each subsequent certification period is the three calendar year period following the close of the previous certification period. The certification will require an officer of the NFFE to certify to the following statements -

(A)(*1*) The NFFE has not had any events of default described in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section; or

(*2*) If there are any events of default, appropriate measures were taken to remediate such failures and to prevent such failures from recurring; and

(B) With respect to any failure to report to the extent required under paragraph (c)(3)(ii), the NFFE has corrected such failure by filing the appropriate information returns; and

(vii) The NFFE has not had its status as a direct reporting NFFE revoked by the IRS.

(4) *Election to be treated as a direct reporting NFFE* - (i) *Manner of making election.* A NFFE may elect to be treated as a direct reporting NFFE by registering on Form 8957 (or such other form as the IRS may prescribe) with the IRS to obtain a GIIN pursuant to the procedures prescribed by the IRS.

(ii) *Effective date of election.* The election is effective upon the issuance of a GIIN to the NFFE.

(iii) *Revocation of election by NFFE.* The election may not be revoked by the NFFE without the consent of the Commissioner. The NFFE must notify its sponsoring entity (if applicable) and all relevant withholding agents if it revokes its election.

(iv) *Revocation of election by Commissioner.* The election may be revoked by the Commissioner upon an event of default described in paragraph (v) of this section.

(v) *Event of default.* An event of default occurs if a direct reporting NFFE fails to perform any of the obligations described in (c)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section. An event of default also includes any misrepresentation of a material fact to the IRS.

(vi) *Notice of event of default.* Following an event of default known by or disclosed to the IRS, the IRS will deliver to the NFFE a notice of default specifying the event of default. The IRS will request that the NFFE remediate the event of default within a specified time period. The NFFE must respond to the notice of default and provide information responsive to an IRS request for information or state the reasons why the NFFE does not agree that an event of default has occurred. If the NFFE does not provide a response within the specified time period, the IRS may, at its sole discretion, deliver a notice to the NFFE that its election to be treated as a direct reporting NFFE has been revoked. A NFFE may request, within 90 days of receipt, reconsideration of a notice of default or notice of revocation by written request to the Deputy Commissioner (International), LB&I.

(vii) *Remediation of event of default.* A NFFE will be permitted to remediate an event of default to the extent it agrees with the IRS on a remediation plan. The IRS may, as part of a remediation plan, require additional information from the NFFE.

(5) *Election by a direct reporting NFFE to be treated as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE.*

(i) *Definition of sponsored direct reporting NFFE.* A NFFE is a *sponsored direct reporting NFFE* if the NFFE is a direct reporting NFFE and if another entity, other than a nonparticipating FFI, has agreed with the NFFE to act as its sponsoring entity, as described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section.

(ii) *Requirements for sponsoring entity of a sponsored direct reporting NFFE.* A sponsoring entity meets the requirements of this paragraph (c)(5)(ii) if the sponsoring entity -

(A) Is authorized to act on behalf of the NFFE;

(B) Has registered with the IRS as a sponsoring entity;

(C) Has registered the NFFE with the IRS as a sponsored direct reporting NFFE;

(D) Agrees to perform, on behalf of the NFFE, all due diligence, reporting, and other requirements that the NFFE would have been required to perform as a direct reporting NFFE;

(E) Identifies the NFFE in all reporting completed on the NFFE's behalf;

(F) Complies with the certification and other requirements in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section;

(G) Has not had its status as a sponsoring entity revoked; and

(H) Agrees to notify all relevant withholding agents and the IRS if its status as a sponsoring entity is revoked, if it otherwise ceases to be the sponsoring entity of any of its sponsored direct reporting NFFEs (for example, if the sponsored direct reporting NFFE changes sponsors), or if the status of any of its sponsored direct reporting NFFEs has been revoked.

(iii) *Revocation of status as sponsoring entity.* The IRS may revoke a sponsoring entity's status as a sponsoring entity with respect to all sponsored direct reporting NFFEs if there is a material failure by the sponsoring entity to comply with its obligations under paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section with respect to any sponsored direct reporting NFFE.

(iv) *Liability of sponsoring entity.* A sponsoring entity is not liable for any failure to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. A sponsored direct reporting NFFE will remain liable for all of its chapter 4 obligations without regard to any failure of its sponsoring entity to comply with the obligations contained in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section that the sponsoring entity has agreed to undertake on behalf of the NFFE.

(1) *In general.* For purposes of this section, except in the case of a payee that is a QI, WP, or WT, a withholding agent may treat a withholdable payment as beneficially owned by the payee as determined under § 1.1471-3. Thus, a withholding agent may treat a withholdable payment as beneficially owned by an excepted NFFE (other than a QI, WP, or WT) if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation to determine the payee's status as an excepted NFFE under the rules of § 1.1471-3(d).

(2) *Payments made to a NFFE that is a QI, WP, or WT.* A withholding agent may treat the payee of a withholdable payment as a NFFE that is a QI, WP, or WT if the withholding agent can reliably associate the payment with valid documentation to determine the payee's status as such under the rules of § 1.1471-3(b)(3) and (d).
