##### § 1.801-7 Variable annuities. #####

(a) *In general.* (1) Section 801(g)(1) provides that for purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, an annuity contract includes a contract which provides for the payment of a variable annuity computed on the basis of recognized mortality tables and the investment experience of the company issuing such a contract. A variable annuity differs from the ordinary or fixed dollar annuity in that the annuity benefits payable under a variable annuity contract vary with the insurance company's investment experience with respect to such contracts while the annuity benefits paid under a fixed dollar annuity contract are guaranteed irrespective of the company's actual investment earnings.

(2) The reserves held with respect to the annuity contracts described in section 801(g)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall qualify as life insurance reserves within the meaning of section 801(b)(1) and paragraph (a) of § 1.801-4 provided such reserves are required by law (as defined in paragraph (b) of § 1.801-5) and are set aside to mature or liquidate, either by payment or reinsurance, future unaccrued claims arising from such contracts involving, at the time with respect to which the reserve is computed, life, health, or accident contingencies. Accordingly, a company issuing variable annuity contracts shall qualify as a life insurance company for Federal income tax purposes if it satisfies the requirements of section 801(a) (relating to the definition of a life insurance company) and paragraph (b) of § 1.801-3.

(b) *Special rules for variable annuities* - (1) *Adjusted reserves rate; assumed rate.* The adjusted reserves rate for any taxable year with respect to the annuity contracts described in section 801(g)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and the rate of interest assumed by the taxpayer for any taxable year in calculating the reserve on any such contract, shall be a rate equal to the current earnings rate determined under section 801(g)(3) and subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. However, any change in the rate of interest assumed by the taxpayer in calculating the reserve on a variable annuity contract for any taxable year which is attributable to an increase or decrease in the current earnings rate, shall not be treated as a change of basis in computing reserves for purposes of section 806(b) (relating to certain changes in reserves) or section 810 (d)(1) (relating to adjustment for change in computing reserves).

(2) *Current earnings rate.* (i) The current earnings rate for any taxable year with respect to the annuity contracts described in section 801(g)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be the current earnings rate determined under section 805(b)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of § 1.805-5 with respect to such contracts, reduced by the percentage obtained by dividing (*a*) the amount of the actuarial margin charge on all such variable annuity contracts issued by the taxpayer, by (*b*) the mean of the reserves for such contracts.

(ii) For purposes of section 801(g)(3) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the term *actuarial margin charge* means any amount retained by the company from gross investment income pursuant to the terms of the variable annuity contract in excess of any portion of the investment expenses which is attributable to such contract and which is deductible under section 804(c) and paragraph (b) of § 1.804-4.

(3) *Increases and decreases in reserves.* (i) Section 801(g)(4) provides that for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b) (relating to adjustments for increases or decreases in certain reserves), the sum of the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of § 1.810-2 taken into account as of the close of the taxable year shall be adjusted:

(*a*) By subtracting therefrom the sum of any amounts added from time to time (for the taxable year) to the reserves for variable annuity contracts described in section 801(g)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section by reason of realized or unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets held in relation thereto, and

(*b*) By adding thereto the sum of any amounts subtracted from time to time (for the taxable year) from such reserves by reason of realized or unrealized depreciation in the value of such assets.

(ii) The application of section 801(g)(4) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.Company M, a life insurance company issuing only variable annuity contracts of the type described in section 801(g)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, increased its life insurance reserves held with respect to such contracts during the taxable year 1959 by $275,000. Of the total increase in the reserves, $100,000 was attributable to premium receipts, $50,000 to dividends and interest, $100,000 to unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets held in relation to such reserves, and $25,000 to realized capital gains on the sale of such assets. As of the close of the taxable year 1959, the reserves held by company M with respect to all variable annuity contracts amounted to $1,275,000. However, under section 801(g)(4) and subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, this amount must be reduced by the $100,000 unrealized asset value appreciation and the $25,000 of realized capital gains. Accordingly, for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b), the amount of these reserves which is to be taken into account as of the close of the taxable year 1959 under section 810(c) is $1,150,000 ($1,275,000 less $125,000).

(c) *Companies issuing variable annuities and other contracts.* (1) In the case of a life insurance company which issues both annuity contracts described in section 801(g)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section and other contracts, the policy and other contract liability requirements (as defined in section 805(a) and paragraph (b) of § 1.805-4) of such a company for any taxable year shall be considered to be the sum of:

(i) The policy and other contract liability requirements computed with respect to the items which relate to such variable annuity contracts, and

(ii) The policy and other contract liability requirements computed by excluding the items taken into account under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.

(2) [Reserved for regulations to be issued under section 801(g)(5)(B).]

(d) *Termination.* Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of section 801(g) and paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall not apply with respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1962.
