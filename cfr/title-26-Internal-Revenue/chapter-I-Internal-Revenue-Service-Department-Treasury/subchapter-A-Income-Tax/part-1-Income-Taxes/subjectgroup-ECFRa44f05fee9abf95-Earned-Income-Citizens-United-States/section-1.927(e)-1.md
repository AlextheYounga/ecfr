##### § 1.927(e)-1 Special sourcing rule. #####

(a) *Source rules for related persons* - (1) *In general.* The income of a person described in section 482 from a sale of export property giving rise to foreign trading gross receipts of a FSC that is treated as from sources outside the United States shall not exceed the amount that would be treated as foreign source income earned by such person if the pricing rule under section 994 that corresponds to the rule used under section 925 with respect to such transaction applied to such transaction. This special sourcing rule also applies if the FSC is acting as a commission agent for the related supplier with respect to the transaction described in the first sentence of this paragraph (a)(1) that gives rise to foreign trading gross receipts and the transfer pricing rules of section 925 are used to determine the commission payable to the FSC. No limitation results under this section with respect to a transaction to which the section 482 pricing rule under section 925(a)(3) applies.

(2) *Grouping of transactions.* If, for purposes of determining the FSC's profits under the administrative pricing rules of sections 925(a) (1) and (2), grouping of transactions under § 1.925(a)-1T(c)(8) was elected, the same grouping shall be used for making the determinations under the special sourcing rule in this section.

(3) *Corresponding DISC pricing rules* - (i) *In general.* For purposes of this section -

(A) The DISC gross receipts pricing rule of section 994(a)(1) corresponds to the gross receipts pricing rule of section 925(a)(1);

(B) The DISC combined taxable income pricing rule of section 994(a)(2) corresponds to the combined taxable income pricing rule of section 925(a)(2); and

(C) The DISC section 482 pricing rule of section 994(a)(3) corresponds to the section 482 pricing rule of section 925(a)(3).

(ii) *Special rules.* For purposes of this section -

(A) The DISC pricing rules of section 994(a)(1) and (2) shall be determined without regard to export promotion expenses;

(B) Qualified export receipts under section 994(a)(1) and

(2) Shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the foreign trading gross receipts arising from the transaction; and

(C) Combined taxable income for purposes of section 994(a)(2) shall be deemed to be an amount equal to the combined taxable income for purposes of section 925(a)(2) arising from the transaction.

(b) *Examples.* The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:

Example 1.(i) R and F are calendar year taxpayers. R, a domestic manufacturing company, owns all the stock of F, which is a FSC acting as a commission agent for R. For the taxable year, R and F used the combined taxable income pricing rule of section 925(a)(2). For the taxable year, the combined taxable income of R and F is $100 from the sale of export property, as defined in section 927(a), manufactured by R using production assets located in the United States. Title to the export property passed outside of the United States.

(ii) Under section 925(a)(2), 23 percent of the $100 combined taxable income of R and F ($23) is allocated to F and the remaining $77 is allocated to R. Absent the special sourcing rule, under section 863(b) the $77 income allocated to R would be sourced $38.50 U.S. source and $38.50 foreign source. Under the special sourcing rule, the amount of foreign source income earned by a related supplier of a FSC shall not exceed the amount that would result if the corresponding DISC pricing rule applied. The DISC combined taxable income pricing rule of section 994(a)(2) corresponds to the combined taxable income pricing rule of section 925(a)(2). Under section 994(a)(2), $50 of the combined taxable income ($100 × .50) would be allocated to the DISC and the remaining $50 would be allocated to the related supplier. Under section 863(b), the $50 income allocated to the DISC's related supplier would be sourced $25 U.S. source and $25 foreign source. Accordingly, under the special sourcing rule, the foreign source income of R shall not exceed $25.

Example 2.(i) Assume the same facts as in *Example 1* except that R and F used the gross receipts pricing rule of section 925(a)(1). In addition, for the taxable year foreign trading gross receipts derived from the sale of the export property are $2,000.

(ii) Under section 925(a)(1), 1.83 percent of the $2,000 foreign trading gross receipts ($36.60) is allocated to F and the $63.40 remaining combined taxable income ($100−$36.60) is allocated to R. Absent the special sourcing rule, under section 863(b) the $63.40 income allocated to R would be sourced $31.70 U.S. source and $31.70 foreign source. Under the special sourcing rule, the amount of foreign source income earned by a related supplier of a FSC shall not exceed the amount that would result if the corresponding DISC pricing rule applied. The DISC gross receipts pricing rule of section 994(a)(1) corresponds to the gross receipts pricing rule of section 925(a)(1). Under section 994(a)(1), $80 ($2,000 × .04) would be allocated to the DISC and the $20 remaining combined taxable income would be allocated to the related supplier. Under section 863(b), the $20 income allocated to the DISC's related supplier would be sourced $10 U.S. source and $10 foreign source. Accordingly, under the special sourcing rule, the foreign source income of R shall not exceed $10.

(c) *Effective date.* The rules of this section are applicable to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997.
