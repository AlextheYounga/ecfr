##### § 1.861-8T Computation of taxable income from sources within the United States and from other sources and activities (temporary). #####

(a) *In general.* (1) [Reserved]

(2) *Allocation and apportionment of deductions in general.* If an affiliated group of corporations joins in filing a consolidated return under section 1501, the provisions of this section are to be applied separately to each member in that affiliated group for purposes of determining such member's taxable income, except to the extent that expenses, losses, and other deductions are allocated and apportioned as if all domestic members of an affiliated group were a single corporation under section 864(e) and the regulations thereunder. See § 1.861-9T through § 1.861-11T for rules regarding the affiliated group allocation and apportionment of interest expense, and § 1.861-14T for rules regarding the affiliated group allocation and apportionment of expenses other than interest.

(a)(3) through (b) [Reserved] For further guidance, *see* § 1.861-8(a)(3) through (b).

(c) *Apportionment of deductions* - (1) *Deductions definitely related to a class of gross income.* Where a deduction has been allocated in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section to a class of gross income which is included in one statutory grouping and the residual grouping, the deduction must be apportioned between the statutory grouping and the residual grouping. Where a deduction has been allocated to a class of gross income which is included in more than one statutory grouping, such deduction must be apportioned among the statutory groupings and, where necessary, the residual grouping. Thus, in determining the separate limitations on the foreign tax credit imposed by section 904(d)(1) or by section 907, the income within a separate limitation category constitutes a statutory grouping of income and all other income not within that separate limitation category (whether domestic or within a different separate limitation category) constitutes the residual grouping. In this regard, the same method of apportionment must be used in apportioning a deduction to each separate limitation category. Also, see paragraph (f)(1)(iii) of this section with respect to the apportionment of deductions among the statutory groupings designated in section 904(d)(1). If the class of gross income to which a deduction has been allocated consists entirely of a single statutory grouping or the residual grouping, there is no need to apportion that deduction. If a deduction is not definitely related to any gross income, it must be apportioned ratably as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. A deduction is apportioned by attributing the deduction to gross income (within the class to which the deduction has been allocated) which is in one or more statutory groupings and to gross income (within the class) which is in the residual grouping. Such attribution must be accomplished in a manner which reflects to a reasonably close extent the factual relationship between the deduction and the grouping of gross income. In apportioning deductions, it may be that for the taxable year there is no gross income in the statutory grouping or that deductions will exceed the amount of gross income in the statutory grouping. See paragraph (d)(1) of this section with respect to cases in which deductions exceed gross income. In determining the method of apportionment for a specific deduction, examples of bases and factors which should be considered include, but are not limited to -

(i) Comparison of units sold,

(ii) Comparison of the amount of gross sales or receipts,

(iii) Comparison of costs of goods sold,

(iv) Comparison of profit contribution,

(v) Comparison of expenses incurred, assets used, salaries paid, space utilized, and time spent which are attributable to the activities or properties giving rise to the class of gross income, and

(iv) Comparison of the amount of gross income.

Paragraph (e) (2) through (8) of this section provides the applicable rules for allocation and apportionment of deductions for interest, research and development expenses, and certain other deductions. The effects on tax liability of the apportionment of deductions and the burden of maintaining records not otherwise maintained and making computations not otherwise made shall be taken into consideration in determining whether a method of apportionment and its application are sufficiently precise. A method of apportionment described in this paragraph (c)(1) may not be used when it does not reflect, to a reasonably close extent, the factual relationship between the deduction and the groupings of income. Furthermore, certain methods of apportionment described in this paragraph (c)(1) may not be used in connection with any deduction for which another method is prescribed. The principles set forth above are applicable in apportioning both deductions definitely related to a class which constitutes less than all of the taxpayer's gross income and to deductions related to all of the taxpayer's gross income. If a deduction is not related to any class of gross income, it must be apportioned ratably as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

(2) *Apportionment based on assets.* Certain taxpayers are required by paragraph (e)(2) of this section and § 1.861-9T to apportion interest expense on the basis of assets. A taxpayer may apportion other deductions based on the comparative value of assets that generate income within each grouping, provided that such method reflects the factual relationship between the deduction and the groupings of income and is applied in accordance with the rules of § 1.861-9T(g). In general, such apportionments must be made either on the basis of the tax book value of those assets or on their fair market value. However, once the taxpayer uses fair market value, the taxpayer and all related persons must continue to use such method unless expressly authorized by the Commissioner to change methods. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2) the term *related persons* means two or more persons in a relationship described in section 267(b). In determining whether two or more corporations are members of same controlled group under section 267(b)(3), a person is considered to own stock owned directly by such person, stock owned with the application of section 1563(e)(1), and stock owned by the application of section 267(c). In determining whether a corporation is related to a partnership under section 267(b)(10), a person is considered to own the partnership interest owned directly by such person and the partnership interest owned with the application of section 267(e)(3). In the case of any corporate taxpayer that -

(i) Uses tax book value, and

(ii) Owns directly or indirectly (within the meaning of § 1.861-11T(b)(2)(ii)) 10 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote in any other corporation (domestic or foreign) that is not a member of the affiliated group (as defined in section 864(e)(5)), such taxpayer shall adjust its basis in that stock in the manner described in § 1.861-11T(b).

(3) [Reserved]

(d) *Excess of deductions and excluded and eliminated items of income.* (1) [Reserved]

(2) *Allocation and apportionment to exempt, excluded or eliminated income* - (i) *In general.* In the case of taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, except to the extent otherwise permitted by § 1.861-13T, the following rules shall apply to take account of income that is exempt or excluded, or assets generating such income, with respect to allocation and apportionment of deductions.

(A) *Allocation of deductions.* In allocating deductions that are definitely related to one or more classes of gross income, exempt income (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) shall be taken into account.

(B) *Apportionment of deductions.* In apportioning deductions that are definitely related either to a class of gross income consisting of multiple groupings of income (whether statutory or residual) or to all gross income, exempt income and exempt assets (as defined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section) shall not be taken into account.

For purposes of apportioning deductions which are not taken into account under § 1.1502-13 in determining gain or loss from intercompany transactions, as defined in § 1.1502-13, income from such transactions shall be taken into account in the year such income is ultimately included in gross income.

(ii) *Exempt income and exempt asset defined* - (A) *In general.* For purposes of this section, the term *exempt income* means any income that is, in whole or in part, exempt, excluded, or eliminated for federal income tax purposes. The term *exempt asset* means any asset the income from which is, in whole or in part, exempt, excluded, or eliminated for federal tax purposes.

(B) *Certain stock and dividends.* The term “exempt income” includes the portion of the dividends that are deductible under -

(*1*) Section 243(a) (1) or (2) (relating to the dividends received deduction),

(*2*) Section 245(a) (relating to the dividends received deduction for dividends from certain foreign corporations).

Thus, for purposes of apportioning deductions using a gross income method, gross income would not include a dividend to the extent that it gives rise to a dividend received deduction under either section 243(a)(1), section 243(a)(2), or section 245(a). In the case of a life insurance company taxable under section 801, the amount of such stock that is treated as tax exempt shall not be reduced because a portion of the dividends received deduction is disallowed as attributable to the policyholder's share of such dividends. See § 1.861-14T(h) for a special rule concerning the allocation of reserve expenses of a life insurance company. In addition, for purposes of apportioning deductions using an asset method, assets would not include that portion of stock equal to the portion of dividends paid thereon that would be deductible under either section 243(a)(1), section 243(a)(2), or section 245(a). In the case of stock which generates, has generated, or can reasonably be expected to generate qualifying dividends deductible under section 243(a)(3), such stock shall not constitute a tax exempt asset. Such stock and the dividends thereon will, however, be eliminated from consideration in the apportionment of interest expense under the consolidation rule set forth in § 1.861-10T(c), and in the apportionment of other expenses under the consolidation rules set forth in § 1.861-14T.

(iii) *Income that is not considered tax exempt.* The following items are not considered to be exempt, eliminated, or excluded income and, thus, may have expenses, losses, or other deductions allocated and apportioned to them:

(A) In the case of a foreign taxpayer (including a foreign sales corporation (FSC)) computing its effectively connected income, gross income (whether domestic or foreign source) which is not effectively connected to the conduct of a United States trade or business;

(B) In computing the combined taxable income of a DISC or FSC and its related supplier, the gross income of a DISC or a FSC;

(C) For all purposes under subchapter N of the Code, including the computation of combined taxable income of a possessions corporation and its affiliates under section 936(h), the gross income of a possessions corporation for which a credit is allowed under section 936(a); and

(D) Foreign earned income as defined in section 911 and the regulations thereunder (however, the rules of § 1.911-6 do not require the allocation and apportionment of certain deductions, including home mortgage interest, to foreign earned income for purposes of determining the deductions disallowed under section 911(d)(6)).

(iv) *Prior years.* For expense allocation and apportionment rules applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987, and for later years to the extent permitted by § 1.861-13T, see § 1.861-8(d)(2) (Revised as of April 1, 1986).

(e) *Allocation and apportionment of certain deductions.* (1) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.861-8(e)(1).

(2) *Interest.* The rules concerning the allocation and apportionment of interest expense and certain interest equivalents are set forth in §§ 1.861-9T through § 1.861-13T.

(3) through (f)(1)(i) [Reserved] For further guidance, *see* § 1.861-8(e)(3) through (f)(1)(i).

(ii) *Separate limitations to the foreign tax credit.* Section 904(d)(1) requires that the foreign tax credit limitation be determined separately in the case of the types of income specified therein. Accordingly, the income within each separate limitation category constitutes a statutory grouping of income and all other income not within that separate limitation category (whether domestic or within a different separate limitation category) constitutes the residual groups.

(f)(1)(iii) through (g) *Examples 1 through 23* [Reserved] For further guidance, *see* § 1.861-8(f)(1)(iii) through (g) *Examples 1 through 23.*

Example 24. Exempt, excluded, or eliminated income.(i) *Income method* - (A) *Facts.* X, a domestic corporation organized on January 1, 1987, is engaged in a number of businesses worldwide. X owns a 25-percent voting interest in each of five corporations engaged in the business A, two of which are domestic and three of which are foreign. X incurs stewardship expenses in connection with these five stock investments in the amount of $100. X apportions its stewardship expenses using a gross income method. Each of the five companies pays a dividend in the amount of $100. X is entitled to claim the 80-percent dividends received deduction on dividends paid by the two domestic companies. Because tax exempt income is considered in the allocation of deductions, X's $100 stewardship expense is allocated to the class of income consisting of dividends from business A companies. However, because tax exempt income is not considered in the apportionment of deductions within a class of gross income, the gross income of the two domestic companies must be reduced to reflect the availability of the dividends received deduction. Thus, for purposes of apportionment, the gross income paid by the three foreign companies is considered to be $100 each, while the gross income paid by the domestic companies is considered to be $20 each. Accordingly, X has total gross income from business A companies, for purposes of apportionment, of $340. As a result, $29.41 of X's stewardship expense is apportioned to each of the foreign companies and $5.88 of X's stewardship expense is apportioned to each of the domestic companies.

(ii) *Asset method* - (A) *Facts.* X, a domestic corporation organized on January 1, 1987, carries on a trade or business in the United States. X has deductible interest expense incurred in 1987 of $60,000. X owns all the stock of Y, a foreign corporation. X also owns 49 percent of the voting stock of Z, a domestic corporation. Neither Y nor Z has retained earnings and profits at the end of 1987. X apportions its interest expense on the basis of the fair market value of its assets. X has assets worth $1,500,000 that generate domestic source income, among which are tax exempt municipal bonds worth $100,000, and the stock of Z, which has a value of $500,000. The Y stock owned by X has a fair market value of $2,000,000 and generates solely foreign source general limitation income.

(B) *Allocation.* No portion of X's interest expense is directly allocable solely to identified property within the meaning of § 1.861-1OT. Thus, X's deduction for interest is definitely related to all its gross income as a class.

(C) *Apportionment.* For purposes of apportioning expenses, assets that generate exempt, eliminated, or excluded income are not taken into account. Because X's municipal bonds are tax exempt, they are not taken into account in apportioning interest expense. Since X is entitled to claim under section 243 to 80-percent dividends received deduction with respect to the dividend it received from Z, 80 percent of the value of that stock is not taken into account as an asset for purposes of apportionment under the asset method. X apportions its interest deduction between the statutory grouping of foreign source general limitation income and the residual grouping of domestic source income as follows:

To foreign source general limitation income:
