(a)-(e) [Reserved]

(f) *Participation*—(1) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (f), any work done by an individual (without regard to the capacity in which the individual does the work) in connection with an activity in which the individual owns an interest at the time the work is done shall be treated for purposes of this section as participation of the individual in the activity.

(f)(2)-(h)(2) [Reserved]

(h)(3) *Coordination with rules governing the treatment of passthrough entities.* If a taxpayer takes into account for a taxable year of the taxpayer any item of gross income or deduction from a partnership or S corporation that is characterized as an item of gross income or deduction from an activity in which the taxpayer materially participated under § 1.469-2T(e)(1), the taxpayer is treated as materially participating in the activity for the taxable year for purposes of applying § 1.469-5T(a)(5) and (6) to any succeeding taxable year of the taxpayer.

(i) [Reserved]

(j) *Material participation for preceding taxable years*—(1) *In general.* For purposes of § 1.469-5T(a)(5) and (6), a taxpayer has materially participated in an activity for a preceding taxable year if the activity includes significant section 469 activities that are substantially the same as significant section 469 activities that were included in an activity in which the taxpayer materially participated (determined without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5)) for the preceding taxable year.

(2) *Material participation for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1987.* In any case in which it is necessary to determine whether an individual materially participated in any activity for a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1987 (other than a taxable year of a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust ending after December 31, 1986), the determination shall be made without regard to paragraphs (a)(2) through (7) of this section.

(k) *Examples.* Example 1—Example 4 [Reserved]

Example 5.In 1993, D, an individual, acquires stock in an S corporation engaged in a trade or business activity (within the meaning of § 1.469-1(e)(2)). For every taxable year from 1993 through 1997, D is treated as materially participating (without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5)) in the activity. D retires from the activity at the beginning of 1998, and would not be treated as materially participating in the activity for 1998 and subsequent taxable years if material participation of those years were determined without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5). Under § 1.469-5T(a)(5) of this section, however, D is treated as materially participating in the activity for taxable years 1998 through 2003 because D materially participated in the activity (determined without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5) for five taxable years during the ten taxable years that immediately precede each of those years. D is not treated under § 1.469-5T(a)(5) as materially participating in the activity for taxable years beginning after 2003 because for those years D has not materially participated in the activity (determined without regard to § 1.469-5T(a)(5) for five of the last ten immediately preceding taxable years.[T.D. 8417, 57 FR 20758, May 15, 1992]
