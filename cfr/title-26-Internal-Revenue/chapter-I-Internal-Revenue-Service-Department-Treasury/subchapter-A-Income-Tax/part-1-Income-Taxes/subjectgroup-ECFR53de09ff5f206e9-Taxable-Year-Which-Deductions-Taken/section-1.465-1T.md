##### § 1.465-1T Aggregation of certain activities (temporary). #####

(a) *General rule.* A partner in a partnership or an S corporation shareholder may aggregate and treat as a single activity—

(1) The holding, production, or distribution of more than one motion picture film or video tape by the partnership or S corporation,

(2) The farming (as defined in section 464 (e)) of more than one farm by the partnership or S corporation,

(3) The exploration for, or exploitation of, oil and gas resources with respect to more than one oil and gas property by the partnership or S corporation, or

(4) The exploration for, or exploitation of, geothermal deposits (within the meaning of section 613(e)(3)) with respect to more than one geothermal property by the partnership or S corporation.

Thus, for example, if a partnership or S corporation is engaged in the activity of exploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas resources with respect to 10 oil and gas properties, a partner or S corporation shareholder may aggregate those properties and treat the aggregated oil and gas activities as a single activity. If that partnership or S corporation also is engaged in the activity of farming with respect to two farms, the partner or shareholder may aggregate the farms and treat the aggregated farming activities as a single separate activity. Except as provided in section 465(c)(2)(B)(ii), the partner or shareholder cannot aggregate the farming activity with the oil and gas activity.

(b) *Effective date.* This section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983 and before January 1, 1985.
