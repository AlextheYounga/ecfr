##### § 1.165-11T Election to take disaster loss deduction for preceding year (temporary). #####

(a) *In general.* Section 165(i) allows a taxpayer who has sustained a loss attributable to a federally declared disaster in a taxable year to elect to deduct that disaster loss in the preceding year. This section provides rules and procedures for making and revoking an election to claim a disaster loss in the preceding year.

(b) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply for purposes of this section:

(1) A *federally declared disaster* means any disaster subsequently determined by the President of the United States to warrant assistance by the Federal Government under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act or a successor enactment.

(2) A *federally declared disaster area* is the area determined to be eligible for assistance pursuant to the Presidential declaration in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) A *disaster loss* is a loss occurring in a federally declared disaster area that is attributable to a federally declared disaster and that is otherwise allowable as a deduction for the disaster year under section 165(a) and §§ 1.165-1 through 1.165-10.

(4) The *disaster year* is the taxable year in which a taxpayer sustains a loss attributable to a federally declared disaster.

(5) The *preceding year* is the taxable year immediately prior to the disaster year.

(c) *Scope and effect of election.* An election made pursuant to section 165(i) for a disaster loss attributable to a particular disaster applies to the entire loss sustained by the taxpayer from that disaster during the disaster year. If the taxpayer makes a section 165(i) election with respect to a particular disaster occurring during the disaster year, the disaster to which the election relates is deemed to have occurred, and the disaster loss to which the election applies is deemed to have been sustained, in the preceding year.

(d) *Requirement to file consistent returns.* A taxpayer may not make a section 165(i) election for a disaster loss if the taxpayer claims a deduction (as a loss, as cost of goods sold, or otherwise) for the same loss for the disaster year. If a taxpayer has claimed a deduction for a disaster loss for the disaster year and the taxpayer wishes to make a section 165(i) election with respect to such loss, the taxpayer must file an amended return to remove the previously deducted loss on or before the date that the taxpayer makes the section 165(i) election for such loss. Similarly, if a taxpayer has claimed a deduction for a disaster loss for the preceding year based on a section 165(i) election and the taxpayer wishes to revoke that election, the taxpayer must file an amended return to remove the loss for the preceding year on or before the date the taxpayer files the return or amended return for the disaster year that includes the loss.

(e) *Manner of making election.* An election under section 165(i) to deduct a disaster loss for the preceding year is made on an original federal tax return for the preceding year or an amended federal tax return for the preceding year in the manner specified by guidance issued pursuant to these regulations. See paragraph (h) of this section.

(f) *Due date for making election.* The due date for making the section 165(i) election is six months after the due date for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return for the disaster year (determined without regard to any extension of time to file).

(g) *Revocation.* Subject to the requirements in paragraph (d) of this section, a section 165(i) election may be revoked on or before the date that is ninety (90) days after the due date for making the election.

(h) *Additional guidance.* The time and manner for making and revoking a section 165(i) election under paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of this section may be modified through guidance published in the Federal Register or in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see § 601.601(d) of this chapter).

(i) *Effective/applicability date.* This section is effective October 13, 2016 and applies to elections, revocations, and any other related actions that can be made or taken on or after October 13, 2016.

(j) *Expiration date.* The section expires October 13, 2019.
