##### § 1.167(b)-4 Other methods. #####

(a) Under section 167(b)(4) a taxpayer may use any consistent method of computing depreciation, such as the sinking fund method, provided depreciation allowances computed in accordance with such method do not result in accumulated allowances at the end of any taxable year greater than the total of the accumulated allowances which could have resulted from the use of the declining balance method described in section 167(b)(2). This limitation applies only during the first two-thirds of the useful life of the property. For example, an asset costing $1,000 having a useful life of six years may be depreciated under the declining balance method in accordance with § 1.167(b)-2, at a rate of 331/3 percent. During the first four years or 2/3 of its useful life, maximum depreciation allowances under the declining balance method would be as follows:

|             |Current depreciation|Accumulated depreciation|Balance|
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------|
|Cost of asset|                    |                        |$1,000 |
| First year  |        $333        |          $333          |  667  |
| Second year |        222         |          555           |  445  |
| Third year  |        148         |          703           |  297  |
| Fourth year |         99         |          802           |  198  |

An annual allowance computed by any other method under section 167(b)(4) could not exceed $333 for the first year, and at the end of the second year the total allowances for the two years could not exceed $555. Likewise, the total allowances for the three years could not exceed $703 and for the four years could not exceed $802. This limitation would not apply in the fifth and sixth years. See section 167(c) and § 1.167(c)-1 for restriction on the use of certain methods.

(b) It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that a method of depreciation under section 167(b)(4) is both a reasonable and consistent method and that it does not produce depreciation allowances in excess of the amount permitted under the limitations provided in such section.
