##### § 1.47-6 Partnerships. #####

(a) *In general*—(1) *Disposition or cessation in hands of partnership.* If a partnership disposes of any partnership section 38 property (or if any partnership section 38 property otherwise ceases to be section 38 property in the hands of the partnership) before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into account in computing qualified investment with respect to such property, a recapture determination shall be made with respect to each partner who is treated, under paragraph (f) of § 1.46-3, as a taxpayer with respect to such property. Each such recapture determination shall be made with respect to the share of the basis (or cost) of such property taken into account by such partner in computing his qualified investment. For purposes of each such recapture determination the actual useful life of such property shall be the period beginning with the date on which it was placed in service by the partnership and ending with the date of the disposition or cessation. In making a recapture determination under this subparagraph there shall be taken into account any prior recapture determinations made with respect to the partner in connection with the same property. For definition of “recapture determination” see paragraph (a)(1) of § 1.47-1.

(2) *Disposition of partner's interest.* (i) If—

(*a*) The basis (or cost) of partnership section 38 property is taken into account by a partner in computing his qualified investment, and

(*b*) After the date on which such partnership section 38 property was placed in service by the partnership and before the close of the estimated useful life of the property, such partner's proportionate interest in the general profits of the partnership (or in the particular item of property) is reduced (for example, by a sale, by a change in the partnership agreement, or by the admission of a new partner) below the percentage specified in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, then, on the date of such reduction such partnership section 38 property ceases to be section 38 property with respect to such partner to the extent of the actual reduction in such partner's proportionate interest in the general profits of the partnership (or in the particular item of property). (For example, if $100 of the basis of section 38 property was taken into account by a partner and if his proportionate interest in the general profits of the partnership is reduced from 60 percent to 30 percent (that is, 50 percent of his original interest), then such property shall be treated as having ceased to be section 38 property to the extent of $50.) Accordingly, a recapture determination shall be made with respect to such partner. For purposes of such recapture determination the actual useful life of such property shall be the period beginning with the date on which it was placed in service by the partnership and ending with the date on which it is treated as having ceased to be section 38 property with respect to the partner. In making a recapture determination under this subparagraph there shall be taken into account any prior recapture determination made with respect to the partner in connection with the same property.

(ii) The percentage referred to in subdivision (i)(*b*) of this subparagraph is 662/3 percent of the partner's proportionate interest in the general profits of the partnership (or in the particular item of property) for the year in which such property was placed in service. However, once property has been treated under this subparagraph as having ceased to be section 38 property to any extent the percentage referred to shall be 331/3 percent of the partner's proportionate interest in the general profits of the partnership (or in the particular item of property) for the year in which such property was placed in service.

(iii) In determining a partner's proportionate interest in the general profits of a partnership for purposes of this subparagraph, the partner shall be considered to own any interest in such a partnership which he owns directly or indirectly (through ownership in other entities provided the other entities' bases in such interest are determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of such interest in the hands of the partner). For example, if A, whose proportionate interest in the general profits of partnership X is 20 percent, transfers all of such interest to corporation Y in exchange for all of the stock of Y in a transaction to which section 351 applies, then, for purposes of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, A shall be considered to own a 20-percent interest in partnership X. Any taxpayer who seeks to establish his interest in a partnership under the rule of this subdivision shall maintain adequate records to demonstrate his indirect interest in the partnership after any such transfer or transfers.

(b) *Examples.* Paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples in each of which it is assumed that ABC Partnership, which makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, acquired and placed in service on June 1, 1962, three items of section 38 property. The basis and estimated useful life of each item of section 38 property are as follows:

|Asset No.| Basis |Estimated useful life Years|
|---------|-------|---------------------------|
|    1    |$30,000|             4             |
|    2    |30,000 |             6             |
|    3    |30,000 |             8             |

Partners A and B, who make their returns on the basis of a calendar year, share the profits and losses of ABC Partnership equally. Under paragraph (f)(2) of § 1.46-3, each partner's share of the basis of the partnership section 38 property is as follows:

| Asset No.  |Estimated useful life (years)| Basis |Partners share of basis|       |
|------------|-----------------------------|-------|-----------------------|-------|
|A 50 percent|        B 50 percent         |       |                       |       |
|     1      |              4              |$30,000|        $15,000        |$15,000|
|     2      |              6              |30,000 |        15,000         |15,000 |
|     3      |              8              |30,000 |        15,000         |15,000 |

Assuming that during 1962 partners A and B did not place in service any section 38 property and that they did not own any interests in other partnerships, electing small business corporations, estates, or trusts, the qualified investment of each partner is $30,000, computed as follows:

|Partnership asset No.|Share of basis|Applicable percentage|Qualified investment|
|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|
|          1          |   $15,000    |        331/3        |       $5,000       |
|          2          |    15,000    |        662/3        |       10,000       |
|          3          |    15,000    |         100         |       15,000       |
|                     |              |                     |       30,000       |

For the taxable year 1962, each partner's credit earned of $2,100 (7 percent of $30,000) was allowed under section 38 as a credit against his liability for tax.Example 1.(i) On December 2, 1965, ABC Partnership sells asset No. 3 to X Corporation.

(ii) The actual useful life of asset No. 3 is three years and six months. The recomputed qualified investment with respect to each partner's share of the basis of asset No. 3 is zero ($15,000 shares of basis multiplied by zero applicable percentage) and for the taxable year 1962, each partner's recomputed credit earned is $1,050 (7 percent of $15,000). The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on each of the partners for the taxable year 1965 is increased by the $1,050 decrease in his credit earned for the taxable year 1962 (that is, $2,100 original credit earned minus $1,050 recomputed credit earned).

Example 2.(i) On December 3, 1964, partner A sells one-half of his 50 percent interest in ABC Partnership to C, and on December 3, 1965, A sells the remaining one- half of his interest to D. In addition, on January 2, 1966, ABC Partnership sells asset No. 3 to X Corporation.

(ii) Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, on December 3, 1964, 50 percent of the basis of each of the three items of section 38 property ceases to be section 38 property with respect to partner A since immediately after the December 3, 1964, sale A's proportionate interest in the general profits of ABC Partnership is reduced to 50 percent of his proportionate interest in the general profits of ABC Partnership for 1962. The actual useful life of the share of the basis of each of the section 38 properties which cease to be section 38 property with respect to A is two years and six months (that is, the period beginning with June 1, 1962, and ending with December 3, 1964). Partner A's recomputed qualified investment with respect to such properties is $15,000, computed as follows:

|Partnership asset No.|Share of basis|Applicable percentage|Qualified investment|
|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|
|          1          |    $7,500    |        331/3        |       $2,500       |
|          2          |    7,500     |        662/3        |       5,000        |
|          3          |    7,500     |         100         |       7,500        |
|                     |              |                     |       15,000       |

For the taxable year 1962 partner A's recomputed credit earned is $1,050 (7 percent of $15,000). The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on partner A for the taxable year 1964 is increased by the $1,050 decrease in his credit earned for the taxable year 1962 (that is, $2,100 original credit earned minus $1,050 recomputed credit earned).(iii) Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, on December 3, 1965, the remaining 50 percent of the share of the basis of each of the three items of section 38 property ceases to be section 38 property with respect to partner A since immediately after the December 3, 1965, sale A's proportionate interest in the general profits of ABC Partnership is reduced to zero. The actual useful life of the share of the bases of the section 38 properties which cease to be section 38 property with respect to A is three years and six months (that is, the period beginning with June 1, 1962, and ending with December 3, 1965). A's recomputed qualified investment with respect to such properties is zero. For the taxable year 1962 partner A's recomputed credit earned is zero. The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on partner A for the taxable year 1965 is increased by $1,050 (that is, $2,100 ($2,100 original credit earned minus zero recomputed credit earned) reduced by the $1,050 increase in tax for 1964).

(iv) The actual useful life of asset No. 3 which was sold on January 2, 1966, is three years and seven months. The recomputed qualified investment with respect to partner B's share of the basis of asset No. 3 is zero ($15,000 share of basis multiplied by zero applicable percentage) and for the taxable year 1962, partner B's recomputed credit earned is $1,050 (7 percent of $15,000). The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on partner B for the taxable year 1966 is increased by the $1,050 decrease in his credit earned for the taxable year 1962 ($2,100 original credit earned minus $1,050 recomputed credit earned). The sale of asset No. 3 on January 2, 1966, has no effect on A.
