##### § 1.48D-6T Elective payment election. #####

(a) [Reserved]

(b) *Pre-filing registration required*—(1) *In general.* Pre-filing registration by any taxpayer (including a partnership or an S corporation) in accordance with this paragraph (b) is a condition that must be successfully completed prior to making an elective payment election under section 48D(d)(1) and this section with respect to qualified property placed in service by the taxpayer as part of an advanced manufacturing facility of an eligible taxpayer. An elective payment election will not be effective with respect to the section 48D credit determined with respect to any such qualified property placed in service by any taxpayer unless the taxpayer received a valid registration number for the taxpayer's qualified investment in the advanced manufacturing facility of an eligible taxpayer in accordance with this paragraph (b) and provided the registration number for each qualified investment in each advanced manufacturing facility on its Form 3800, *General Business Credit,* attached to the tax return in accordance with guidance. For purposes of this section, the term *guidance* means guidance published in the Federal Register or Internal Revenue Bulletin, as well as administrative guidance such as forms, instructions, publications, or other guidance on the IRS.gov website. See §§ 601.601 and 601.602 of this chapter. However, completion of the pre-filing registration requirements and receipt of a registration number does not, by itself, mean the taxpayer is eligible to receive a payment with respect to any section 48D credit determined with respect to the qualified property.

(2*) Manner of registration.* Unless otherwise provided in guidance, a taxpayer must complete the pre-filing registration process electronically through the IRS electronic portal and in accordance with the instructions provided therein.

(3) *Members of a consolidated group.* A member of a consolidated group is required to complete pre-filing registration as a condition of, and prior to, making an elective payment election. See § 1.1502-77 (providing rules regarding the status of the common parent as agent for its members).

(4) *Timing of pre-filing registration.* A taxpayer must satisfy the pre-filing registration requirements of this paragraph (b) and receive a registration number under paragraph (b)(6) of this section prior to making any elective payment election under this section on the taxpayer's tax return for the taxable year at issue.

(5) *Each qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility must have its own registration number.* A taxpayer must obtain a registration number for each qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility of an eligible taxpayer with respect to which an elective payment election is made.

(6) *Information required to complete the pre-filing registration process.* Unless modified in future guidance, a taxpayer must provide the following information to the IRS to complete the pre-filing registration process:

(i) The taxpayer's general information, including its name, address, taxpayer identification number, and type of legal entity;

(ii) Any additional information required by the IRS electronic portal;

(iii) The taxpayer's taxable year, as determined under section 441 of the Code;

(iv) The type of annual return(s) normally filed by the taxpayer with the IRS;

(v) A list of each qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility that the taxpayer intends to use to determine a section 48D credit for which the taxpayer intends to make an elective payment election;

(vi) For each qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility listed in paragraph (b)(5)(v) of this section, any further information required by the IRS electronic portal, such as—

(A) The type of qualified investment in the advanced manufacturing facility;

(B) Physical location (that is, address and coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the advanced manufacturing facility);

(C) Any supporting documentation relating to the construction, reconstruction or acquisition of the advanced manufacturing facility (such as, State and local government permits to operate the advanced manufacturing facility, certifications, and evidence of ownership that ties to the land deed, lease, or other documented right to use and access any land upon which the advanced manufacturing facility is constructed or housed);

(D) The beginning of construction date and the placed in service date of any qualified property that is part of the advanced manufacturing facility;

(E) The source of funds the taxpayer used to acquire the qualified property with respect to which the qualified investment was made; and

(F) Any other information that the taxpayer or entity believes will help the IRS evaluate the registration request;

(vii) The name of a contact person for the taxpayer. The contact person is the person whom the IRS may contact if there is an issue with the registration. The contact person must either possess legal authority to bind the taxpayer or must provide a properly executed power of attorney on Form 2848, *Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative;*

(viii) A penalties of perjury statement, effective for all information submitted as a complete application, and signed by a person with personal knowledge of the relevant facts that is authorized to bind the registrant; and

(ix) Any other information the IRS deems necessary for purposes of preventing duplication, fraud, improper payments, or excessive payments under this section that is provided in guidance.

(7) *Registration number*—(i) *In general.* The IRS will review the information provided and will issue a separate registration number for each qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility of an eligible taxpayer for which the taxpayer making the registration provided sufficient verifiable information.

(ii) *Registration number is only valid for one year.* A registration number is valid only with respect to the taxpayer that obtained the registration number under this section and only for the taxable year for which it is obtained.

(iii) *Renewing registration numbers.* If an elective payment election will be made with respect to any section 48D credit determined with respect to a qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility for a taxable year after a registration number under this section has been obtained, the taxpayer must renew the registration for that subsequent year in accordance with applicable guidance, including attesting that all the facts previously provided are still correct or updating any facts.

(iv) *Amendment of previously submitted registration information if a change occurs before the registration number is used.* As provided in instructions to the pre-filing registration portal, if specified changes occur with respect to a qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility for which a registration number has been previously obtained, a taxpayer must amend the registration (or may need to submit a new registration) to reflect these new facts. For example, if an eligible taxpayer that is the owner of an advanced manufacturing facility previously registered for an elective payment election for a section 48D credit determined with respect to that advanced manufacturing facility and the advanced manufacturing facility undergoes a change of ownership (incident to a corporate reorganization or an asset sale) such that the new owner has a different employer identification number (EIN) than the owner who obtained the original registration, the original owner of the advanced manufacturing facility must amend the original registration to disassociate its EIN from the advanced manufacturing facility and the new owner must submit separately an original registration (or if the new owner previously registered other qualified investments or advanced manufacturing facilities, must amend its original registration) to associate the new owner's EIN with the previously registered advanced manufacturing facility.

(v) *Registration number is required to be reported on the return for the taxable year of the elective payment election.* The taxpayer must include the registration number of the qualified investment in the advanced manufacturing facility on the taxpayer's return as provided in paragraph (b) of this section for the taxable year. The IRS will treat an elective payment election as ineffective with respect to a section 48D credit determined with respect to a qualified investment in an advanced manufacturing facility for which the taxpayer does not include a valid registration number on the annual return.

(c)-(i) [Reserved]

(j) *Applicability date for pre-filing registration requirements.* The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section apply to property placed in service on or after December 31, 2022, and during a taxable year ending on or after June 21, 2023.

(k) *Expiration date.* The applicability of paragraph (b) of this section expires on June 12, 2026.
