##### § 1.103(n)-5T Certification of no consideration for allocation (temporary). #####

Q-1: Who must certify that there was no consideration for an allocation?

A-1: Section 103(n)(12)(A) provides that, with respect to any private activity bond allocated any portion of the State ceiling, the private activity bond will not be described under section 103(a) unless the public official, if any, responsible for such allocation (“responsible public official”) certifies under penalties of perjury that to the best of his knowledge the allocation of the State ceiling to that private activity bond was not made in consideration of any bribe, gift, gratuity, or direct or indirect contribution to any political campaign. With respect to any issue of private activity bonds, the responsible public official is the official or officer of the issuing authority that in fact is responsible for choosing which individual projects will be allocated a portion of the State ceiling. If a body of several individuals is responsible for such choices, any one member of such body qualifies as the responsible public official.

Q-2: What is the penalty for willfully making an allocation in consideration of any bribe, gift, gratuity, or direct or indirect contribution to any political campaign?

A-2: Section 103(n)(12)(B) provides that any person willfully making an allocation of any portion of the State ceiling in consideration of any bribe, gift, gratuity, or direct or indirect contribution to any political campaign will be subject to criminal penalty as though the allocation were a willful attempt to evade tax imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
