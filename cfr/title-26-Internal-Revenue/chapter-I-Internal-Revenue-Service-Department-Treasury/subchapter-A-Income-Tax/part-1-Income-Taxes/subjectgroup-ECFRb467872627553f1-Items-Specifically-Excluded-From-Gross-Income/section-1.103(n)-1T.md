##### § 1.103(n)-1T Limitation on aggregrate amount of private activity bonds (temporary). #####

Q-1: What does section 103(n) provide?

A-1: Interest on an issue of private activity bonds will not be tax exempt unless the aggregrate amount of bonds issued pursuant to that issue, when added to (i) the aggregate amount of private activity bonds previously issued by the issuing authority during the calendar year and (ii) the portion of that year's private activity bond limit that the issuing authority has elected to carry forward to a future year, does not exceed the issuing authority's private activity bond limit for that calendar year. See A-4 of § 1.103(n)-4T with respect to private activity bonds issued under a carryforward election.

Q-2: What is the effective date of section 103(n)?

A-2: In general, section 103(n) applies to private activity bonds issued after December 31, 1983. Section 103(n) does not apply to any issue of obligations, however, if there was an inducement resolution (or other comparable preliminary approval) for the project before June 19, 1984, and the issue for such project is issued before January 1, 1985. An issue of obligations will be considered to be issued for the project pursuant to the inducement resolution in existence before June 19, 1984, to the extent that the nature, character, and purpose of the facility has not changed in any material way, and to the extent that the capacity of the facility has not increased materially; in addition, the issue of obligations must be for the same or a related initial owner, manager, or operator. See § 1.103-10(e) for the definition of related persons. See A-16 of § 1.103(n)-3T with respect to certain projects preliminarily approved before October 19, 1983. The transitional rules provided by section 631(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 do not apply to section 103(n). See § 1.103-13(b)(6) for the rules relating to the date of issue of obligations.

Q-3: If an issue of private activity bonds causes the issuer's private activity bond limit to be exceeded, what is the effect on that issue?

A-3: If an issue of private activity bonds causes the issuing authority's private activity bond limit to be exceeded, no portion of that issue will be treated as obligations described in section 103(a), and interest paid on the issue will be subject to Federal income taxation.

Q-4: If an issue of private activity bonds causes the issuer's private activity bond limit to be exceeded, what is the effect on previous issues of private activity bonds that met the requirements of section 103(n) when issued?

A-4: Private activity bonds issued as part of an issue that met the private activity bond limit when issued continue to meet the requirements of section 103(n) even though a subsequent issue causes the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued by an issuing authority to exceed the authority's private activity bond limit for the calendar year.

*Example.* The following example illustrates the provisions of A-3 and A-4 of this § 1.103(n)-1T:

Example.The State ceiling for State Z for 1986 is $200 million. City M, within the State, and State Z itself are authorized to issue private activity bonds. Under the allocation formula provided by the Governor of State Z, City M has a private activity bond limit of $50 million; the balance of the State ceiling is allocated to State Z. On June 1, 1986, City M issues a $75 activity bonds. On September 1, 1986, State Z issues a $150 million issue of private activity bonds. Based on these facts, the obligations of City M do not meet the requirements of section 103(n) since the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued by City M in 1986 exceeded its private activity bond limit for such year; thus, such obligations are not described in section 103(a). That the State Z issue caused the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued in the State during 1986 to exceed the State ceiling does not cause such obligations to fail to meet the requirements of section 103(n).

Q-5: What is the aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued as part of an issue?

A-5: The aggregate amount of private activity bonds issued as part of an issue is the face amount of the issue.
