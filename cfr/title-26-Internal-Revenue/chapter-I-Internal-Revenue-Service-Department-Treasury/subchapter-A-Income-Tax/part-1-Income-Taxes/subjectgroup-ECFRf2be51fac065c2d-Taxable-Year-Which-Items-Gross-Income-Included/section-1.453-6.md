##### § 1.453-6 Deferred payment sale of real property not on installment method. #####

(a) *Value of obligations.* (1) In transactions included in paragraph (b)(2) of § 1.453-4, that is, sales of real property involving deferred payments in which the payments received during the year of sale exceed 30 percent of the selling price, the obligations of the purchaser received by the vendor are to be considered as an amount realized to the extent of their fair market value in ascertaining the profit or loss from the transaction. Such obligations, however, are not considered in determining whether the payments during the year of sale exceed 30 percent of the selling price.

(2) If the obligations received by the vendor have no fair market value, the payments in cash or other property having a fair market value shall be applied against and reduce the basis of the property sold and, if in excess of such basis, shall be taxable to the extent of the excess. Gain or loss is realized when the obligations are disposed of or satisfied, the amount thereof being the difference between the reduced basis as provided in the preceding sentence and the amount realized therefor. Only in rare and extraordinary cases does property have no fair market value.

(b) *Repossession of property where title is retained by vendor* - (1) *Gain or loss on repossession.* If the vendor in sales referred to in paragraph (a) of this section has retained title to the property and the purchaser defaults in any of his payments, and the vendor repossesses the property, the difference between -

(i) The entire amount of the payments actually received on the contract and retained by the vendor plus the fair market value at the time of repossession of fixed improvements placed on the property by the purchaser, and

(ii) The sum of the profits previously returned as income in connection therewith and an amount representing what would have been a proper adjustment for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion of the property during the period the property was in the hands of the purchaser had the sale not been made, will constitute gain or loss, as the case may be, to the vendor for the year in which the property is repossessed.

(2) *Basis of repossessed property.* The basis of the property described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph in the hands of the vendor will be the original basis at the time of the sale plus the fair market value at the time of repossession of fixed improvements placed on the property by the purchaser, except that, with respect to repossessions occurring after September 18, 1958, the basis of the property shall be reduced by what would have been a proper adjustment for exhaustion, wear and tear, obsolescence, amortization, and depletion of the property during the period the property was in the hands of the purchaser if the sale had not been made.

(c) *Reacquisition of property where title is transferred to purchaser* - (1) *Gain or loss on reacquisition.* If the vendor in sales described in paragraph (a) of this section has previously transferred title to the purchaser, and the purchaser defaults in any of his payments, and the vendor accepts a voluntary reconveyance of the property, in partial or full satisfaction of the unpaid portion of the purchase price, the receipt of the property so reacquired, to the extent of its fair market value at that time, including the fair market value of fixed improvements placed on the property by the purchaser, shall be considered as the receipt of payment on the obligations satisfied. If the fair market value of the property is greater than the basis of the obligations of the purchaser so satisfied (generally, such basis being the fair market value of such obligations previously recognized in computing income), the excess constitutes ordinary income. If the value of such property is less than the basis of such obligations, the difference may be deducted as a bad debt if uncollectible, except that, if the obligations satisfied are securities (as defined in section 165(g)(2)(C)), any gain or loss resulting from the transaction is a capital gain or loss subject to the provisions of sections 1201 through 1241.

(2) *Basis of reacquired property.* If the reacquired property described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph is subsequently sold, the basis for determining gain or loss is the fair market value of the property at the date of reacquisition, including the fair market value of the fixed improvements placed on the property by the purchaser. See section 166 and the regulations thereunder with respect to property reacquired by the vendor in a foreclosure proceeding.

(d) *Effective date.* Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall apply only with respect to taxable years beginning before September 3, 1964, in respect of which an election has not been properly made to have the provisions of section 1038 apply. For rules applicable to taxable years beginning after September 2, 1964, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1957, to which such an election applies, see section 1038, and §§ 1.1038-1 through 1.1038-3.
