##### § 1.806-1 Adjustment for certain reserves. #####

(a) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1953, but before January 1, 1955, and ending after August 16, 1954, a life insurance company writing contracts other than life insurance or annuity contracts (either separately or combined with noncancellable health and accident insurance contracts) must add to its life insurance company taxable income (as a factor in determining 1954 adjusted taxable income) an amount equal to eight times the amount of the adjustment for certain reserves provided in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) The adjustment for certain reserves referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be an amount equal to 31/4 percent of the mean of the unearned premiums and unpaid losses at the beginning and end of the taxable year on such other contracts as are not included in life insurance reserves. If such unearned premiums, however, are less than 25 percent of the net premiums written during the taxable year on such other contracts, then the adjustment shall be 31/4 percent of 25 percent of the net premiums written during the taxable year on such other contracts plus 31/4 percent of the mean of the unpaid losses at the beginning and end of the taxable year on such other contracts. As used in this section, the term “unearned premiums” has the same meaning as in section 832(b)(4) and § 1.832-1.
