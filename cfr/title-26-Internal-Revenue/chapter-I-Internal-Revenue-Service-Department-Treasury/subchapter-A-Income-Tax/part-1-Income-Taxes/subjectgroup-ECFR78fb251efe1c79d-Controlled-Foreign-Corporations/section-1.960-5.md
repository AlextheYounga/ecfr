##### ยง 1.960-5 Credit for taxable year of inclusion binding for taxable year of exclusion. #####

(a) *Taxes not allowed as a deduction for taxable year of exclusion.* In the case of any taxpayer who -

(1) Chooses to claim a foreign tax credit as provided in section 901 for the taxable year for which he is required to include in gross income under section 951(a) an amount attributable to the earnings and profits of a controlled foreign corporation, and

(2) Does not choose to claim a foreign tax credit as provided in section 901 for a taxable year in which he receives an amount which is excluded from gross income under section 959(a)(1) and which is attributable to such earnings and profits of such controlled foreign corporation,

No deduction shall be allowed under section 164 for the taxable year of such exclusion for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued on or with respect to such excluded amount.

(b) *Illustration.* The application of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.Domestic Corporation N owns all the one class of stock of controlled foreign corporation A. Both corporations use the calendar year as the taxable year. All of A Corporation's earnings and profits of $80 for 1978 (after payment of foreign income taxes of $20 on its total income of $100 for such year) are attributable to amount required under section 951(a) to be included in N Corporation's gross income for 1978. For 1978, N Corporation chooses to claim a foreign tax credit for the $20 of foreign income taxes which for such year are paid by A Corporation and deemed paid by N Corporation under section 960(a)(1) and paragraph (c)(1) of ยง 1.960-1. For 1979, A Corporation distributes the entire $80 of 1978 earnings and profits, a foreign income tax of $8 being withheld therefrom. Although N Corporation does not choose to claim a foreign tax credit for 1979, it may not deduct such $8 of foreign income taxes under section 164. Corporation N may, however, deduct under such section a foreign income tax of $4 which is withheld from a distribution of $40 by A Corporation during 1979 from its 1979 earnings and profits.[T.D. 7120, 36 FR 10859, June 4, 1971, as amended by T.D. 7649, 44 FR 60089, Oct. 18, 1979]
