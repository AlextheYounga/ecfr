Example 1.Domestic corporation M owns 800 of the 1,000 shares of the one class of stock in controlled foreign corporation R which owns all of the one class of stock in controlled foreign corporation S. Corporations M, R, and S use the calendar year as a taxable year. In 1964, S Corporation has $100,000 of earnings and profits after the payment of $11,250 of foreign income taxes, and $100,000 of subpart F income. Corporation R has no earnings and profits. With respect to S Corporation, M Corporation is required to include in gross income $80,000 (800/1,000 × $100,000) under section 951(a), and $9,000 ($80,000/$100,000 × $11,250) under section 78. On December 31, 1964, M Corporation must increase the basis of each share of its stock in R Corporation by $100 ($80,000/800).Example 2.A, an individual United States shareholder, owns all of the 1,000 shares of the one class of stock in controlled foreign corporation T. Corporation T and A use the calendar year as a taxable year. In 1964, T Corporation has $80,000 of earnings and profits after the payment of $20,000 of foreign income taxes, and $80,000 of subpart F income. A makes the election under section 962 for 1964 and in accordance with such election pays a United States tax of $23,000 with respect to the $80,000 included in his gross income under section 951(a). On December 31, 1964, A must increase the basis of each share of his stock in T Corporation by $23 ($23,000/1,000).[T.D. 6850, 30 FR 11854, Sept. 16, 1965]
