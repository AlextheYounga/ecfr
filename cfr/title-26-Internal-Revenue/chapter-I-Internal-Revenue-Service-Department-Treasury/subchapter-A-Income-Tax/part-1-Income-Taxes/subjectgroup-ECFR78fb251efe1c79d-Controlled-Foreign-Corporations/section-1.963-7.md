(b) *Extension of time for making a minimum distribution* - (1) *In general.* This paragraph applies only with respect to a taxable year of a United States shareholder ending on or before September 30, 1964, for which an election to secure an exclusion under section 963 is made where, in case of a first-tier election, the distribution period of such first-tier corporation with respect to its taxable year to which such election applies ends on or before the 90th day after such date, and where, in the case of a chain or group election, the distribution period ends on or before such 90th day with respect to the taxable year to which the election applies of any of the foreign corporations in such chain or group.

(2) *Conditions for obtaining extension of time.* A distribution on stock with respect to which the election under section 963 was made which is received by the United States shareholder from a foreign corporation which was the single first-tier corporation, or a corporation in the chain or group, as the case may be, with respect to which the election was made, shall count toward a minimum distribution under section 963 for such year of election if -

(i) The distribution is made on or before such 90th day,

(ii) The shareholder, in a statement attached to its return or amended return for such year (which is filed on or before such 90th day) indicates the foreign corporation or corporations from which the distribution is made and states that, and the extent to which, the distribution is to count toward such minimum distribution,

(iii) The distribution is of such a nature as would have permitted it to count toward a minimum distribution for such taxable year of the United States shareholder if it had been made on the last day of such year, and

(iv) The United States shareholder includes the distribution in gross income as if it were received on the last day of such taxable year of election.

The distribution shall be applied against the earnings and profits of the single first-tier corporation or the foreign corporations in the chain or group for the taxable year of such corporation or corporations to which the election applies.

(3) *Year of receipt.* To the extent that a distribution counts toward a minimum distribution under this paragraph with respect to a taxable year of the United States shareholder, it shall be treated as having been received by the shareholder in that year for the purpose of determining gross income and the assessment of interest, additional amounts, and assessable penalties; and, for purposes of the foreign tax credit under section 901, the foreign income taxes paid or accrued, or deemed paid, by the United States shareholder by reason of a distribution of any amount treated as a distribution for such year under this paragraph shall be treated as paid or accrued, or deemed paid, for such year.

(4) *Year of payment.* The distribution shall be treated for purposes of applying paragraph (a) of § 1.963-3, relating to conditions under which earnings and profits are counted toward a minimum distribution, and paragraph (b)(3) of § 1.963-4, relating to rules for distributing through a chain or group, as if it were distributed during the distribution period (as defined in paragraph (g) of § 1.963-3) with respect to the distributing corporation and each foreign corporation through which such distribution is made to the United States shareholder, for the taxable year to which the election under section 963 applies; and the foreign income taxes paid by any foreign corporation by reason of such distribution shall, in the application of section 902 and of the special rules of paragraph (c) of § 1.963-4, be treated as paid or accrued by such foreign corporation for its taxable year to which such election applies. The distribution shall not count toward a minimum distribution for any other taxable year.
