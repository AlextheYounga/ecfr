##### ยง 1.665(b)-1 Accumulation distributions of trusts other than certain foreign trusts; in general. #####

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in ยง 1.665(b)-2, in the case of a trust other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the term *accumulation distribution* for any taxable year means an amount (if in excess of $2,000), by which the amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed within the meaning of section 661(a)(2) for that year exceed the distributable net income (determined under section 643(a)) of the trust, reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of income required to be distributed currently. (In computing the amount of an accumulation distribution pursuant to the preceding sentence, there is taken into account amounts applied or distributed for the support of a dependent under the circumstances specified in section 677(b) or section 678(c) out of corpus or out of other than income for the taxable year and amounts used to discharge or satisfy any person's legal obligation as that term is used in ยง 1.662(a)-4.) If the distribution as so computed is $2,000 or less, it is not an accumulation distribution within the meaning of subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code. If the distribution exceeds $2,000, then the full amount is an accumulation distribution for the purposes of subpart D.

(b) Although amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be distributed under section 661(a)(2) do not exceed the income of the trust during the taxable year, an accumulation distribution may result if such amounts exceed distributable net income reduced (but not below zero) by the amount required to be distributed currently. This may result from the fact that expenses allocable to corpus are taken into account in determining taxable income and hence distributable net income. However, in the case of a trust other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the provisions of subpart D will not apply unless there is undistributed net income in at least one of the five preceding taxable years. See section 666 and the regulations thereunder.

(c) The provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be illustrated by the following examples (it is assumed in each case that the exclusions provided in ยง 1.665(b)-2 do not apply):

Example 1.A trustee properly makes a distribution to a beneficiary of $20,000 during the taxable year 1956, of which $10,000 is income required to be distributed currently to the beneficiary. The distributable net income of the trust is $15,000. There is an accumulation distribution of $5,000 computed as follows:

|                         Total distribution                          |$20,000|   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---|
|Less: Income required to be distributed currently (section 661(a)(1))|10,000 |   |
|            Other amounts distributed (section 661(a)(2))            |10,000 |   |
|                      Distributable net income                       |$15,000|   |
|          Less: Income required to be distributed currently          |10,000 |   |
|                 Balance of distributable net income                 | 5,000 |   |
|                      Accumulation distribution                      | 5,000 |   |

Example 2.Under the terms of the trust instrument, an annuity of $15,000 is required to be paid to A out of income each year and the trustee may in his discretion make distributions out of income or corpus to B. During the taxable year the trust had income of $18,000, as defined in section 643(b), and expenses allocable to corpus of $5,000. Distributable net income amounted to $13,000. The trustee distributed $15,000 of income to A and in the exercise of his discretion, paid $5,000 to B. There is an accumulation distribution of $5,000 computed as follows:

|                            Total distribution                            |$20,000|   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---|
|Less: Income required to be distributed currently to A (section 661(a)(1))|15,000 |   |
|              Other amounts distributed (section 661(a)(2))               | 5,000 |   |
|                         Distributable net income                         |$13,000|   |
|          Less: Income required to be distributed currently to A          |15,000 |   |
|                   Balance of distributable net income                    |   0   |   |
|                      Accumulation distribution to B                      | 5,000 |   |

Example 3.Under the terms of a trust instrument, the trustee may either accumulate the trust income or make distributions to A and B. The trustee may also invade corpus for the benefit of A and B. During the taxable year, the trust had income as defined in section 643(b) of $22,000 and expenses of $5,000 allocable to corpus. Distributable net income amounts to $17,000. The trustee distributed $10,000 each to A and B during the taxable year. There is an accumulation distribution of $3,000 computed as follows:

|               Total distribution                |$20,000|
|-------------------------------------------------|-------|
|Less: income required to be distributed currently|   0   |
|  Other amounts distributed (section 661(a)(2))  |20,000 |
|            Distributable net income             |17,000 |
|            Accumulation distribution            | 3,000 |

(d) There are not taken into account, in computing the accumulation distribution for any taxable year, any amounts deemed distributed in that year because of an accumulation distribution in a later year.
