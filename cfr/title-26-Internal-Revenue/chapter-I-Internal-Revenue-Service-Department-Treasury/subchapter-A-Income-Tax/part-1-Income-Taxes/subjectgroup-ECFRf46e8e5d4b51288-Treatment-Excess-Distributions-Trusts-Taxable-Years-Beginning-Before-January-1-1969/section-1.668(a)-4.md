##### ยง 1.668(a)-4 Tax attributable to throwback. #####

(a) The tax attributable to amounts deemed distributed under section 666 is imposed on the beneficiary for the taxable year of the beneficiary in which the accumulation distribution is made unless the taxable year of the beneficiary is different from that of the trust (see section 662(c) and the regulations thereunder). In the case of a trust (other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person), the tax cannot be greater than the aggregate of the taxes attributable to those amounts had they been included, in accordance with the provisions of section 662 (a)(2) and (b), in the gross income of the beneficiary for the preceding taxable year or years in which they were deemed distributed. In the case of a foreign trust created by a U.S. person, the tax on the beneficiary shall be computed in accordance with the provisions of section 669 and the regulations thereunder. The tax liability of the beneficiary of a trust (other than a foreign trust created by a U.S. person), including the portion of an entire foreign trust which does not constitute a foreign trust created by a U.S. person (see ยง 1.643(d)-1), for the taxable year is computed in the following manner:

(1) First, compute the amount of tax for the taxable year attributable to the section 666 amounts which are included in the gross income of the beneficiary for the year. The tax attributable to those amounts is the difference between the tax for the taxable year computed with the inclusion of the section 666 amounts in gross income and the tax computed without including them in gross income.

(2) Next, compute the tax attributable to the section 666 amounts for each of the preceding taxable years as if they had been included in gross income for those years. The tax attributable to such amounts in each such preceding taxable year is the difference between the tax for such preceding year computed with the inclusion of the section 666 amounts in gross income and the tax for such year computed without including them in gross income. The tax computation for each preceding year shall reflect the taxpayer's marital and dependency status for that year.

(3) The total tax for the taxable year is the tax for that year computed without including the section 666 amounts, *plus:*

(i) The amount of the tax for the taxable year attributable to the section 666 amounts (computed in accordance with subparagraph (1) of this paragraph), or (ii) The sum of the taxes for the preceding taxable years attributable to the section 666 amounts (computed in accordance with subparagraph (2) of this paragraph),

whichever is the smaller.

(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section may be illustrated by the following example:

Example.(1) During the taxable year 1956, $10,000 is deemed distributed under section 666 to a beneficiary, of which $6,000 is deemed distributed by the trust on the last day of 1955 and $4,000 on the last day of 1954. The beneficiary had taxable income (after deductions) from other sources of $5,000 for 1956, $10,000 for 1955, and $10,000 for 1954. The beneficiary's tax liability for 1956 is $4,730 determined as follows:

|                          Year 1956                          |      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|------|
|Tax on $15,000 (taxable income including section 666 amounts)|$4,730|
|Tax on $5,000 (taxable income excluding section 666 amounts) |1,100 |
|           Tax attributable to section 666 amounts           |3,630 |
|                          Year 1955                          |      |
|Tax on $16,000 (taxable income including section 666 amounts)|$5,200|
|Tax on $10,000 (taxable income excluding section 666 amounts)|2,640 |
|           Tax attributable to section 666 amounts           |2,560 |
|                          Year 1954                          |      |
|Tax on $14,000 (taxable income including section 666 amounts)|$4,260|
|Tax on $10,000 (taxable income excluding section 666 amounts)|2,640 |
|           Tax attributable to section 666 amounts           |1,620 |

(2) Inasmuch as the tax of $3,630 attributable to the section 666 amounts as computed at 1956 rates is less than the aggregate of the taxes of $4,180 ($2,560 plus $1,620) determined for the preceding taxable years the amount of $3,630 is added to the tax ($1,100) computed for 1956 without including the section 666 amounts.[T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11814, Nov. 26, 1960, as amended by T.D. 6989, 34 FR 737, Jan. 17, 1969]
