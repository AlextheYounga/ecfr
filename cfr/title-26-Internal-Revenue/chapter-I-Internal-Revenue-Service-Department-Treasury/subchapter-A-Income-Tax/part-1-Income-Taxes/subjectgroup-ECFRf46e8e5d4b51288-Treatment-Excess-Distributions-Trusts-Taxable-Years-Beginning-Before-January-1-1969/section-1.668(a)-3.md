##### § 1.668(a)-3 Excluded amounts. #####

When a trust pays, credits, or is required to distribute to a beneficiary amounts which are excluded under section 665(b) (1), (2), (3), or (4) from the computation of an accumulation distribution, the amount includible under subpart D (section 665 and following), part I, subchapter J, chapter 1 of the Code, in the gross income of the beneficiaries pursuant to § 1.668(a)-1 is first allocated to the beneficiaries as provided in § 1.668(a)-2 and, second, the amount allocable to the beneficiary receiving amounts which are excluded under section 665(b) (1), (2), (3), or (4) is reduced by the excluded amounts. This section may be illustrated by the following examples, in which it is assumed the trusts and beneficiaries report on the calendar year basis and the income of the trusts was derived entirely from taxable interest:

Example 1.(a) A trust in 1957 has income as defined in section 643(b) of $35,000 and expenses allocable to corpus of $5,000. Its distributable net income is, therefore, $30,000 ($35,000−$5,000). The undistributed net income of the trust and the taxes imposed on the trust were $12,840 and $7,260, respectively, for each of the years 1956, 1955, and 1954. The terms of the trust instrument provide for the accumulation of income during the minority of beneficiaries A and B. However, the trustee may make discretionary distributions to either beneficiary after he becomes 21 years of age. Also, the trustee may invade corpus for the benefit of A and B. B became 21 years of age on January 1, 1957, and, as of that date, A was 25 years old. The trustee distributed $50,000 each to A and B during 1957.

(b) Since each beneficiary received one-half of the total amount distributed by the trust, each must include in gross income under section 662(a)(2) one-half ($15,000) of the distributable net income ($30,000) of the trust for 1957.

(c) The excess distribution of $35,000 ($50,000−$15,000) received by B is excluded from the determination of an accumulation distribution under section 665(b)(1) and accordingly is not includible in B's gross income under section 668(a). Nor is such amount treated as an accumulation distribution for the purpose of determining the amount includible in A's gross income under section 668(a).

(d) The accumulation distribution of the trust is $35,000, computed as follows:

| Total distribution by the trust |       |$100,000|
|---------------------------------|-------|--------|
|              Less:              |       |        |
|Distributable net income for 1957|$30,000|        |
|    Excess distribution to B     |35,000 |        |
|                                 |65,000 |        |
| Accumulation distribution to A  |35,000 |        |

(e) The accumulation distribution of $35,000 will be allocated to the preceding taxable years 1956, 1955, and 1954, and the trust will be deemed to have made the following distributions to A on the last day of those years:

|                          | 1956  | 1955  | 1954 | Total |
|--------------------------|-------|-------|------|-------|
| Undistributed net income |$12,840|$12,840|$9,320|$35,000|
|Taxes imposed on the trust| 7,260 | 7,260 |5,270 |19,790 |
|          Total           |20,100 |20,100 |14,590|54,790 |

Thus, A will include $54,790 in his gross income for 1957 under section 668(a). A will, however, receive credit against his tax under section 668(b).Example 2.(a) Under the terms of a trust the trustee may make discretionary distributions out of income to A during her life. The balance of the income is to be accumulated during the minority of her son, B, and is to be distributed to him when he becomes 21 years of age. Thereafter the trustee may also make discretionary payments of income to B. Also, the trustee may invade corpus for the benefit of A and B. B became 21 years of age on December 31, 1955. The distributable net income of the trust for 1955 is $30,000. It had undistributed net income of $12,840 for the preceding taxable year 1954 and the taxes imposed on the trust for such year were $7,260. The trustee distributed $15,000 to A during 1955 and on December 31, 1955, he distributed $60,000 to B, which represented income accumulated during his minority.

(b) Since B received four-fifths of the total amount ($75,000) distributed by the trust during 1955, he must include in his gross income under section 662(a)(2) four-fifths ($24,000) of the distributable net income ($30,000) of the trust for 1955. A will include in her gross income under section 662(a)(2) one-fifth ($6,000) of the distributable net income ($30,000) of the trust for 1955.

(c) The excess distribution of $36,000 ($60,000−$24,000) received by B is excluded from the determination of an accumulation distribution under section 665(b)(1) and accordingly is not includible in his gross income under section 668(a).

(d) The amount treated as an accumulation distribution for the purpose of determining the amount includible in A's gross income for 1955 under section 668(a) is $9,000, computed as follows:

|       Total distribution by the trust        |       |$75,000|
|----------------------------------------------|-------|-------|
|                    Less:                     |       |       |
|      Distributable net income for 1955       |$30,000|       |
|           Excess distribution to B           |36,000 |       |
|                                              |66,000 |       |
|Amount treated as an accumulation distribution| 9,000 |       |

(e) Inasmuch as the amount of $9,000 is less than the total undistributed net income of the trust ($12,840) for the preceding taxable year 1954, a pro rata portion of the taxes imposed on the trust for that year are also deemed distributed by the trust. Thus, A will include $14,089 in her gross income for 1955 under section 668 (a) computed as follows:

|                       1954                        |      |
|---------------------------------------------------|------|
|             Accumulation distribution             |$9,000|
|Taxes imposed on the trust (9,000/ 12,840 × $7,260)|5,089 |
|                       Total                       |14,089|

A will, however, receive credit against her tax under section 668(b).
