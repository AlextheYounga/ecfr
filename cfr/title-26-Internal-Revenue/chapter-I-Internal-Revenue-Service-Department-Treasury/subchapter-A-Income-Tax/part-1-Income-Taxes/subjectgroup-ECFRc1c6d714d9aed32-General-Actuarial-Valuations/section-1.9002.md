##### § 1.9002 Statutory provisions; Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960 (74 Stat. 124). #####

Section 1.*Short title.* This Act may be cited as the “Dealer Reserve Income Adjustment Act of 1960”.

Sec. 2.*Persons to whom this Act applies.* This Act shall apply to any person who, for his most recent taxable year ending on or before June 22, 1959:

(1) Computed, or was required to compute, taxable income under an accrual method of accounting.

(2) Treated any dealer reserve income, which should have been taken into account (under the accrual method of accounting) for such taxable year, as accruable for a subsequent taxable year, and

(3) Before September 1, 1960, makes an election under section 3(a) or 4(a) of this Act.

Sec. 3.*Election to have section 481 apply—(a) General rule.* If:

(1) For the year of the change (determined under subsection (b)), the treatment of dealer reserve income by any person to whom this Act applies is changed to a method proper under the accrual method of accounting (whether or not such person initiated the change),

(2) Such person makes an election under this subsection, and

(3) Such person does not make the election provided by section 4(a),

then, for purposes of section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the change described in paragraph (1) shall be treated as a change in method of accounting not initiated by the taxpayer.

(b) *Year of change, etc.* In applying section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for purposes of this section, the “year of the change” in the case of any person is:

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the first taxable year ending after June 22, 1959, or

(2) The earliest taxable year (whether the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies to such year) for which:

(A) On or before June 22, 1959:

(i) The Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate issued a notice of deficiency, or a written notice of a proposed deficiency, with respect to dealer reserve income, or

(ii) Such person filed with the Secretary or his delegate a claim for refund or credit with respect to dealer reserve income, and

(B) The assessment of any deficiency, or the refund or credit of any overpayment, whichever is applicable, was not, on June 21, 1959, prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law.

For purposes of this section, section 481 of such Code shall be treated as applying to any year of the change to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 applies.

Sec. 4.*Election to have section 481 not apply; payment in installments*—(a) *General rule.* If a person to whom this Act applies makes an election under this subsection, then for purposes of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (and the corresponding provisions of prior law) a change in the treatment of dealer reserve income to a method proper under the accrual method of accounting shall be treated as not a change in method of accounting in respect of which section 481 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 applies. Any election under this subsection shall apply to all taxable years ending on or before June 22, 1959 (whether the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or the corresponding provisions of prior law apply), for which the assessment of any deficiency, or for which refund or credit of any overpayment, whichever is applicable, was not, on June 21, 1959, prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law.

(b) *Election to pay tax in installments*—(1) *Eligibility.* If the net increase in tax (as defined in paragraph (2)) which results solely from the effect of the election provided by subsection (a) exceeds $2,500, then the taxpayer may elect (at the time the election is made under subsection (a)) to pay in two or more (but not to exceed 10) equal annual installments any portion of such net increase which (on the date of such election) is unpaid.

(2) *Net increase in tax defined.* For purposes of this section, the term “net increase in tax” means the amount (if any) by which:

(A) The sum of the increases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election applies and which is attributable to the election, exceeds

(B) The sum of the decreases in tax (including interest) for all taxable years to which the election applies and which is attributable to the election.

For purposes of this paragraph, interest for the period before the date of the election shall be computed as provided in Chapter 67 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws).

(c) *Due date for installments.* If an election is made under subsection (b), the first installment shall be paid on or before the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which the election was made, and each succeeding installment shall be paid on or before the date which is one year after the date prescribed by this subsection for payment of the preceding installment.

(d) *Effect of subsequent redetermination of tax*—(1) *Redetermination.* If:

(A) The taxpayer makes an election under subsection (b), and

(B) There is a redetermination of the taxpayer's tax for any taxable year to which the election provided by subsection (a) applies,

then the net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2) shall be redetermined.

(2) *Effect of increase.* If the redetermination described in paragraph (1)(B) results in an increase in the net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2)), the resulting increase shall be prorated to all the installments. The part of such resulting increase so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has not arrived shall be collected at the same time as, and as a part of, such installment. The part of such resulting increase so prorated to any installment the date for payment of which has arrived shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.

(3) *Effect of decrease.* For treatment of a decrease in the net increase in tax as the result of a redetermination described in paragraph (1)(B), see section 6403 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (relating to overpayment of installment).

(e) *Suspension of interest*—(1) *In general.* If an election under subsection (a) applies and there is a net increase in tax (as defined in subsection (b)(2)), no interest shall be imposed on any underpayment (and no interest shall be paid on any overpayment) attributable to such election for the period beginning on the date of such election and ending on the date prescribed by section 6151(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 for payment of the tax for the taxable year in which the election was made.

(2) *No interest during installment period.* If an election under subsection (b) applies, no interest shall be imposed for the period on or after the date fixed for payment of the first installment unless payment of unpaid installments is accelerated under subsection (f) or (g).

(3) *Interest where payment is accelerated.* If payment is accelerated under subsection (f) or (g), interest determined in accordance with the provisions of section 6601 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 on the entire unpaid tax shall be payable:

(A) If payment is accelerated under subsection (f), from the date of notice and demand provided by such subsection to the date such tax is paid, or

(B) If payment is accelerated under subsection (g), from the date fixed for paying the unpaid installment to the date such tax is paid.

(f) *Termination of installment payment privilege.* The extension of time provided by this section for payment of tax shall cease to apply, and any unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate, if:

(1) In the case of a taxpayer who is an individual, he dies or ceases to engage in a trade or business,

(2) In the case of a taxpayer who is a partner, the entire interest of such partner is transferred or liquidated or the partnership terminates, or

(3) In the case of a taxpayer which is a corporation, the taxpayer ceases to engage in a trade or business, unless the unpaid portion of the tax payable in installments is required to be taken into account by the acquiring corporation under section 5(d).

(g) *Failure to pay installment.* If any installment under this section is not paid on or before the date fixed for its payment by this section (including any extension of time for payment of such installment), the unpaid installments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate.

(h) *Suspension of running of periods of limitation.* The running of the periods of limitation provided by section 6502 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (or corresponding provision of prior law) for the collection of any amount of tax payable in installments under this section shall be suspended for the period of any extension of time for payment granted under this section.
