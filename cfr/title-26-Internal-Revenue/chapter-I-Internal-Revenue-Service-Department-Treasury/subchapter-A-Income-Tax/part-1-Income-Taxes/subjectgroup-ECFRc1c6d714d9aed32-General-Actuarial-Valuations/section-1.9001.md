Sec. 94.*Change from retirement to straight line method of computing depreciation in certain cases*—(a) *Short title.* This section may be cited as the “Retirement-Straight Line Adjustment Act of 1958”.

(b) *Making of election.* Any taxpayer who held retirement-straight line property on his 1956 adjustment date may elect to have this section apply. Such an election shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe. Any election under this section shall be irrevocable and shall apply to all retirement-straight line property as hereinafter provided in this section (including such property for periods when held by predecessors of the taxpayer).

(c) *Retirement-straight line property defined.* For purposes of this section, the term “retirement-straight line property” means any property of a kind or class with respect to which the taxpayer or a predecessor (under the terms and conditions prescribed for him by the Commissioner) for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1940, and before January 1, 1956, changed from the retirement to the straight line method of computing the allowance of deductions for depreciation.

(d) *Basis adjustments as of 1956 adjustment date.* If the taxpayer has made an election under this section, then in determining the adjusted basis on his 1956 adjustment date of all retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer, in lieu of the adjustments for depreciation provided in section 1016(a) (2) and (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the following adjustments shall be made (effective as of his 1956 adjustment date) in respect of all periods before the 1956 adjustment date:

(1) *Depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913.* For depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, on retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer or a predecessor on such date for which cost was or is claimed as basis and which either:

(A) *Retired before changeover.* Was retired by the taxpayer or a predecessor before the changeover date, but only if (i) a deduction was allowed in computing net income by reason of such retirement, and (ii) such deduction was computed on the basis of cost without adjustment for depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913. In the case of any such property retired during any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1929, the adjustment under this subparagraph shall not exceed that portion of the amount attributable to depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, which resulted (by reason of the deduction so allowed) in a reduction in taxes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 or prior income, war-profits, or excess-profits tax laws.

(B) *Held on changeover date.* Was held by the taxpayer or a predecessor on the changeover date. This subparagraph shall not apply to property to which paragraph (2) applies.

The adjustment determined under this paragraph shall be allocated (in the manner prescribed by the Secretary) among all retirement-straight line property held by the taxpayer on his 1956 adjustment date.

(2) *Property disposed of after changeover and before 1956 adjustment date.* For that portion of the reserve prescribed by the Commissioner in connection with the changeover which was applicable to property:

(A) Sold, or

(B) With respect to which a deduction was allowed for Federal income tax purposes by reason of casualty or “abnormal” retirement in the nature of special obsolescence, if such sale occurred in, or such deduction was allowed for, a period on or after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date.

(3) *Depreciation allowable from changeover to 1956 adjustment date.* For depreciation allowable, under the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner in connection with the changeover, for all periods on and after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date.

This subsection shall apply only with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1955.

(e) *Effect on period from changeover to 1956 adjustment date.* If the taxpayer has made an election under this section, then in determining the adjusted basis of any retirement-straight line property as of any time on or after the changeover date and before the taxpayer's 1956 adjustment date, in lieu of the adjustments for depreciation provided in section 1016(a) (2) and (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and the corresponding provisions of prior revenue laws, the following adjustments shall be made:

(1) *For prescribed reserve.* For the amount of the reserve prescribed by the Commissioner in connection with the changeover.

(2) *For allowable depreciation.* For the depreciation allowable under the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner in connection with the changeover.

(f) *Equity invested capital, etc.* If an election is made under this section, then (notwithstanding the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commissioner in connection with the changeover):

(1) *Equity invested capital.* In determining equity invested capital under sections 458 and 718 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, accumulated earnings and profits as of the changeover date, and as of the beginning of each taxable year thereafter, shall be reduced by the depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913, as computed under subsection (d)(1)(B); and

(2) *Definition of equity capital.* In determining the adjusted basis of assets for the purpose of section 437(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (and in addition to any other adjustments required by such Code), the basis shall be reduced by depreciation sustained before March 1, 1913 (as computed under subsection (d)), together with any depreciation allowable under subsection (e)(2) for any period before the year for which the excess profits credit is being computed.
