##### § 1.7874-7T Disregard of certain stock attributable to passive assets (temporary). #####

(a) *Scope.* This section identifies certain stock of a foreign acquiring corporation that is attributable to passive assets and that is disregarded in determining the ownership fraction. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth the general rule regarding when stock of a foreign acquiring corporation is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction under this section. Paragraph (c) of this section provides a de minimis exception to the application of the general rule of paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section provides rules for the treatment of partnerships, and paragraph (e) of this section provides rules addressing the interaction of this section with the expanded affiliated group rules of section 7874(c)(2)(A) and § 1.7874-1. Paragraph (f) of this section provides definitions. Paragraph (g) of this section provides examples illustrating the application of the rules of this section. Paragraph (h) of this section provides dates of applicability, and paragraph (i) of this section provides the date of expiration.

(b) *General rule.* If, on the completion date, more than fifty percent of the gross value of all foreign group property constitutes foreign group nonqualified property, then stock of the foreign acquiring corporation is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction in an amount equal to the product of -

(1) The value of the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation, other than stock that is described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) and stock that is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction under either § 1.7874-1(b) or § 1.7874-4T(b); and

(2) The foreign group nonqualified property fraction.

(c) *De minimis ownership.* Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if -

(1) The ownership percentage described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii), determined without regard to the application of paragraph (b) of this section and §§ 1.7874-4T(b) and 1.7874-10T(b), is less than five (by vote and value); and

(2) On the completion date, former domestic entity shareholders or former domestic entity partners, as applicable, in the aggregate, own (applying the attribution rules of section 318(a) with the modifications described in section 304(c)(3)(B)) less than five percent (by vote and value) of the stock of (or a partnership interest in) each member of the expanded affiliated group.

(d) *Treatment of partnerships.* For purposes of this section, if one or more members of the modified expanded affiliated group own, in the aggregate, more than 50 percent (by value) of the interests in a partnership, the partnership is treated as a corporation that is a member of the modified expanded affiliated group.

(e) *Interaction with expanded affiliated group rules.* Stock that is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section is taken into account for purposes of determining whether an entity is a member of the expanded affiliated group for purposes of applying section 7874(c)(2)(A) and determining whether an acquisition qualifies as an internal group restructuring or results in a loss of control, as described in § 1.7874-1(c)(2) and (3), respectively. However, such stock is excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction for purposes of section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) regardless of whether it would otherwise be included in the denominator of the ownership fraction as a result of the application of § 1.7874-1(c).

(f) *Definitions.* In addition to the definitions provided in § 1.7874-12T, the following definitions apply for purposes of this section.

(1) *Foreign group nonqualified property* - (i) *General rule.* Foreign group nonqualified property means foreign group property described in § 1.7874-4T(i)(7), other than the following:

(A) Property that gives rise to income described in section 954(h), determined -

(*1*) In the case of property held by a foreign corporation, by substituting the term “foreign corporation” for the term “controlled foreign corporation;” and

(*2*) In the case of property held by a domestic corporation, by substituting the term “domestic corporation” for the term “controlled foreign corporation,” without regard to the phrase “other than the United States” in section 954(h)(3)(A)(ii)(I), and without regard to any inference that the tests in section 954(h) should be calculated or determined without taking transactions with customers located in the United States into account.

(B) Property that gives rise to income described in section 954(i), determined by substituting the term “foreign corporation” for the term “controlled foreign corporation.”

(C) Property that gives rise to income described in section 1297(b)(2)(A) or (B).

(D) Property held by a domestic corporation that is subject to tax as an insurance company under subchapter L of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, provided that the property is required to support, or is substantially related to, the active conduct of an insurance business.

(ii) *Special rule.* Foreign group nonqualified property also means any foreign group property that, in a transaction related to the acquisition, is acquired in exchange for other property, including cash, if such other property would be described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section had the transaction not occurred.

(2) *Foreign group property* means any property (including property that gives rise to stock that is excluded from the ownership fraction under § 1.7874-4T(b)) held on the completion date by the modified expanded affiliated group, other than -

(i) Property that is directly or indirectly acquired in the domestic entity acquisition;

(ii) Stock or a partnership interest in a member of the modified expanded affiliated group; and

(iii) An obligation of a member of the modified expanded affiliated group.

(3) *Foreign group nonqualified property fraction* means a fraction calculated with the following numerator and denominator:

(i) The numerator of the fraction is the gross value of all foreign group nonqualified property, other than property received by the expanded affiliated group that gives rise to stock that is excluded from the ownership fraction under § 1.7874-4T(b).

(ii) The denominator of the fraction is the gross value of all foreign group property, other than property received by the expanded affiliated group that gives rise to stock that is excluded from the ownership fraction under § 1.7874-4T(b).

(4) *Modified expanded affiliated group* means, with respect to a domestic entity acquisition, the group described in either paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section or paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section. A *member of the modified expanded affiliated group* is an entity included in the modified expanded affiliated group.

(i) When the foreign acquiring corporation is not the common parent corporation of the expanded affiliated group, the expanded affiliated group determined as if the foreign acquiring corporation was the common parent corporation.

(ii) When the foreign acquiring corporation is the common parent corporation of the expanded affiliated group, the expanded affiliated group.

(g) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.

Example 1.*Application of general rule* - (i) *Facts.* Individual A owns all 20 shares of the sole class of stock of FA, a foreign corporation. FA acquires all the stock of DT, a domestic corporation, solely in exchange for 76 shares of newly issued FA stock (DT acquisition). In a transaction related to the DT acquisition, FA issues 4 shares of stock to Individual A in exchange for Asset A, which has a gross value of $50x. On the completion date, in addition to the DT stock and Asset A, FA holds Asset B, which has a gross value of $150x, and Asset C, which has a gross value of $100x. Assets A and B, but not Asset C, are nonqualified property (within the meaning of § 1.7874-4T(i)(7)). Further, Asset C was not acquired in a transaction related to the DT acquisition.

(ii) *Analysis.* The 4 shares of FA stock issued to Individual A in exchange for Asset A are disqualified stock under § 1.7874-4T(c) and are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction pursuant to § 1.7874-4T(b). Furthermore, additional shares of FA stock are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. This is because on the completion date, the gross value of all foreign group property is $300x (the sum of the gross values of Assets A, B, and C), the gross value of all foreign group nonqualified property is $200x (the sum of the gross values of Assets A and B), and thus 66.67% of the gross value of all foreign group property constitutes foreign group nonqualified property ($200x/$300x). Because FA has only one class of stock outstanding, the shares of FA stock that are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section are calculated by multiplying 20 shares of FA stock (100 shares less the 76 shares described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) and the 4 shares of disqualified stock) by the foreign group nonqualified property fraction. The numerator of the foreign group nonqualified property fraction is $150x (the gross value of Asset B) and the denominator is $250x (the sum of the gross values of Assets B and C). Accordingly, 12 shares of FA stock are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section (20 shares multiplied by $150x/$250x). Thus, a total of 16 shares are excluded from the denominator of the ownership fraction (4 + 12). As a result, the ownership fraction is 76/84.

Example 2.*Application of de minimis exception* - (i) *Facts.* Individual A owns all 96 shares of the sole class of stock of FA, a foreign corporation. Individual B wholly owns DT, a domestic corporation. Individuals A and B are not related. FA acquires all the stock of DT solely in exchange for 4 shares of newly issued FA stock (DT acquisition). On the completion date, in addition to all of the stock of DT, FA holds Asset A, which is nonqualified property (within the meaning of § 1.7874-4T(i)(7)).

(ii) *Analysis.* Without regard to the application of §§ 1.7874-4T(b) and 1.7874-10T(b) and paragraph (b) of this section, the ownership percentage described in section 7874(a)(2)(B)(ii) would be less than 5 (by vote and value), or 4 (4/100, or 4 shares of FA stock held by Individual B by reason of owning the DT stock, determined under § 1.7874-2(f)(2), over 100 shares of FA stock outstanding after the DT acquisition). Furthermore, on the completion date, Individual B owns less than 5% (by vote and value) of the stock of FA and DT (the members of the expanded affiliated group). Accordingly, the de minimis exception in paragraph (c) of this section applies. Therefore, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply and the ownership fraction is 4/100.

Example 3.*Foreign acquiring corporation not common parent of EAG* - (i) *Facts.* FP, a foreign corporation, owns all 85 shares of the sole class of stock of FA, a foreign corporation. FA acquires all the stock of DT, a domestic corporation, solely in exchange for 65 shares of newly issued FA stock (DT acquisition). On the completion date, FA, in addition to all of the stock of DT, owns Asset A, which has a gross value of $40x, and Asset B, which has a gross value of $45x. Moreover, on the completion date, in addition to the 85 shares of FA stock, FP owns Asset C, which has a gross value of $10x. Assets A and C, but not Asset B, are nonqualified property (within the meaning of § 1.7874-4T(i)(7)). Further, Asset B was not acquired in a transaction related to the DT acquisition in exchange for nonqualified property.

(ii) *Analysis.* Under paragraph (f)(2) of this section, Assets A and B, but not Asset C, are foreign group property. Although Asset C is held on the completion date by FP, a member of the expanded affiliated group, Asset C is not foreign group property because FP is not a member of the modified expanded affiliated group. This is the case because if the expanded affiliated group were determined based on FA as the common parent corporation, FP would not be a member of such expanded affiliated group (see paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section). Under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, Asset A, but not Asset B, is foreign group nonqualified property. Therefore, on the completion date, the gross value of all foreign group property is $85x (the sum of the gross values of Assets A and B), and the gross value of all foreign group nonqualified property is $40x (the gross value of Asset A). Accordingly, on the completion date, only 47.06% of the gross value of all foreign group property constitutes foreign group nonqualified property ($40x/$85x). Consequently, paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to exclude any FA stock from the denominator of the ownership fraction.

(h) *Applicability dates.* Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (h), this section applies to domestic entity acquisitions completed on or after September 22, 2014. Paragraphs (c), (d), and (f)(2) and (4) of this section apply to domestic entity acquisitions completed on or after April 4, 2016. Paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(A)(*2*) and (f)(1)(i)(D) of this section, as well as the portion of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section relating to property that gives rise to income described in section 1297(b)(2)(B), apply to domestic entity acquisitions completed on or after November 19, 2015. For domestic entity acquisitions completed on or after September 22, 2014, and before April 4, 2016, however, taxpayers may elect to apply paragraphs (c), (d), and (f)(2) and (4) of this section. In addition, for domestic entity acquisitions completed on or after September 22, 2014, and before April 4, 2016, taxpayers may elect to apply paragraph (f)(2) of this section by substituting the term “expanded affiliated group” for the term “modified expanded affiliated group.” Furthermore, for domestic entity acquisitions completed on or after September 22, 2014, and before November 19, 2015, taxpayers may elect to apply paragraphs (f)(1)(i)(A)(*2*) and (f)(1)(i)(D) of this section, as well as the portion of paragraph (f)(1)(i)(C) of this section relating to property that gives rise to income described in section 1297(b)(2)(B).

(i) *Expiration date.* The applicability of this section expires on or before April 4, 2019.
