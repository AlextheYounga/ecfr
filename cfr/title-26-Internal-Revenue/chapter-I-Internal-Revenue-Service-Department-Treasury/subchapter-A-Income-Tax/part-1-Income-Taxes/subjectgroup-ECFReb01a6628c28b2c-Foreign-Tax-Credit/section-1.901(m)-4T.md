##### § 1.901(m)-4T Determination of basis difference (temporary). #####

(a) *In general.* This section provides rules for determining for each RFA the basis difference that arises as a result of a CAA. A basis difference is computed separately with respect to each foreign income tax for which an asset subject to a CAA is an RFA. Paragraph (b) of this section provides the general rule for determining basis difference that references only U.S. basis in the RFA. Paragraph (c) of this section provides for an election to determine basis difference by reference to foreign basis and sets forth the procedures for making the election. Paragraph (d) of this section provides special rules for determining basis difference in the case of a section 743(b) CAA. Paragraph (e) of this section provides a special rule for determining basis difference in an RFA with respect to a CAA to which paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section do not apply. Paragraph (f) of this section provides examples illustrating the rules of this section. Paragraph (g) of this section provides the effective/applicability date, and paragraph (h) of this section provides the expiration date.

(b) *General rule.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, basis difference is the U.S. basis in the RFA immediately after the CAA, less the U.S. basis in the RFA immediately before the CAA. Basis difference is an attribute that attaches to an RFA.

(c) *Foreign basis election.* [Reserved].

(d) *Determination of basis difference in a section 743(b) CAA* - (1) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (e) of this section, if there is a section 743(b) CAA, basis difference is the resulting basis adjustment under section 743(b) that is allocated to the RFA under section 755.

(2) *Foreign basis election.* [Reserved].

(e) *Determination of basis difference in an RFA with respect to a CAA with respect to which paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section do not apply.* For CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and before July 21, 2014, other than CAAs occurring before July 21, 2014, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 *of this chapter* that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014, basis difference in an RFA with respect to the CAA is the amount of any basis difference (within the meaning of section 901(m)(3)(C)(i)) that had not been taken into account under section 901(m)(3)(B) either as of July 21, 2014, or, in the case of an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 *of this chapter* that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014, prior to the transactions that are deemed to occur under § 301.7701-3(g) as a result of the change in classification.

(f) *Examples.* [Reserved].

(g) *Effective/applicability date.* (1) Paragraphs (a), (b), and (d)(1) of this section apply to CAAs occurring on or after July 21, 2014, and to CAAs occurring before that date resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014. Paragraph (e) of this section applies to CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011, and before July 21, 2014, other than CAAs occurring before July 21, 2014, resulting from an entity classification election made under § 301.7701-3 *of this chapter* that is filed on or after July 29, 2014, and that is effective on or before July 21, 2014. Taxpayers may, however, consistently apply paragraph (d)(1) of this section to all section 743(b) CAAs occurring on or after January 1, 2011. For this purpose, persons that are related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)) will be treated as a single taxpayer.

(2)-(3) [Reserved]

(h) *Expiration date.* The applicability of this section expires on December 6, 2019.
