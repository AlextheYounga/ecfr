##### § 1.901(m)-5T Basis difference taken into account (temporary). #####

(a) *In general.* [Reserved].

(b) *Basis difference taken into account under applicable cost recovery method* - (1) *In general.* [Reserved].

(2) *Determining a cost recovery amount* - (i) *General rule.* A cost recovery amount for an RFA is determined by applying the applicable cost recovery method to the basis difference rather than to the U.S. basis.

(ii) *U.S. basis subject to multiple cost recovery methods.* [Reserved].

(3) *Applicable cost recovery method.* [Reserved].

(c) *Basis difference taken into account as a result of a disposition* - (1) *In general.* [Reserved].

(2) *Determining a disposition amount* - (i) *Disposition is fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax.* If a disposition of an RFA is fully taxable (that is, results in all gain or loss, if any, being recognized with respect to the RFA) for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, the disposition amount is equal to the unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.

(ii) *Disposition is not fully taxable for purposes of U.S. income tax or the foreign income tax (or both).* If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, the disposition amount is determined under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii). See § 1.901(m)-6T for rules regarding the continued application of section 901(m) if the RFA has any unallocated basis difference after determining the disposition amount under paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, as applicable.

(A) *Positive basis difference.* If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, and the RFA has a positive basis difference, the disposition amount equals the lesser of:

(*1*) Any foreign disposition gain plus any U.S. disposition loss (for this purpose, expressed as a positive amount), or

(*2*) Unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.

(B) *Negative basis difference.* If the disposition of an RFA is not fully taxable for purposes of both U.S. income tax and the foreign income tax, and the RFA has a negative basis difference, the disposition amount equals the greater of:

(*1*) Any U.S. disposition gain (for this purpose, expressed as a negative amount) plus any foreign disposition loss, or

(*2*) Unallocated basis difference with respect to the RFA.

(iii) *Disposition of an RFA after a section 743(b) CAA.* If an RFA was subject to a section 743(b) CAA and subsequently there is a disposition of the RFA, then, for purposes of determining the disposition amount, foreign disposition gain or foreign disposition loss are specially defined to mean the amount of gain or loss recognized for purposes of the foreign income tax on the disposition of the RFA that is allocable to the partnership interest that was transferred in the section 743(b) CAA. In addition, U.S. disposition gain or U.S. disposition loss are specially defined to mean the amount of gain or loss recognized for U.S. income tax purposes on the disposition of the RFA that is allocable to the partnership interest that was transferred in the section 743(b) CAA, taking into account the basis adjustment under section 743(b) that was allocated to the RFA under section 755.

(d) *General rules for allocating and assigning a cost recovery amount or a disposition amount when the RFA owner (U.S.) is a fiscally transparent entity.* [Reserved].

(e) *Special rules for certain section 743(b) CAAs.* [Reserved]

(f) *Mid-year transactions.* [Reserved]
