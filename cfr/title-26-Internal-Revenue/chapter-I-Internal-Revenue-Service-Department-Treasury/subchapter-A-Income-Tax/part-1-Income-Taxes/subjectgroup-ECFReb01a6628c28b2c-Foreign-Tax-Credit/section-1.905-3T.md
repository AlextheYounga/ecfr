##### § 1.905-3T Adjustments to United States tax liability and to the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes as a result of a foreign tax redetermination (temporary). #####

(a) *Effective/applicability dates* - (1) *Currency translation.* Except as provided in § 1.905-5T, paragraph (b) of this section applies to taxes paid or accrued in taxable years of United States taxpayers beginning on or after November 7, 2007 and to taxes paid or accrued by a foreign corporation in its taxable years which end with or within a taxable year of the domestic corporate shareholder beginning on or after November 7, 2007. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997, and before November 7, 2007, section 986(a), as amended by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, shall apply. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1998, § 1.905-3T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007) shall apply.

(2) *Foreign tax redeterminations.* Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years of United States taxpayers beginning on or after November 7, 2007 where the foreign tax redetermination affects the amount of foreign taxes paid or accrued by a United States taxpayer. Where the redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation affects the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960 with respect to post-1986 undistributed earnings of the foreign corporation, paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section apply to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years of a foreign corporation which end with or within a taxable year of the domestic corporate shareholder beginning on or after November 7, 2007. For corresponding rules applicable to foreign tax redeterminations occurring in taxable years beginning before November 7, 2007, see §§ 1.905-3T and 1.905-5T (as contained in 26 CFR part 1, revised as of April 1, 2007).

(b) *Currency translation rules* - (1) *Translation of foreign taxes taken into account when accrued* - (i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, in the case of a taxpayer or a member of a qualified group (as defined in section 902(b)(2)) that takes foreign income taxes into account when accrued, the amount of any foreign taxes denominated in foreign currency that have been paid or accrued, additional tax liability denominated in foreign currency, taxes withheld in foreign currency, or estimated taxes paid in foreign currency shall be translated into dollars using the average exchange rate (as defined in § 1.989(b)-1) for the United States taxable year to which such taxes relate.

(ii) *Exceptions* - (A) *Taxes not paid within two years.* Any foreign income taxes denominated in foreign currency that are paid more than two years after the close of the United States taxable year to which they relate shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes. To the extent any accrued foreign income taxes denominated in foreign currency remain unpaid two years after the close of the taxable year to which they relate, see paragraph (b)(3) of this section for translation rules for the required adjustments.

(B) *Taxes paid before taxable year begins.* Any foreign income taxes paid before the beginning of the United States taxable year to which such taxes relate shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes.

(C) *Inflationary currency.* Any foreign income taxes the liability for which is denominated in any inflationary currency shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes. For this purpose, the term *inflationary currency* means the currency of a country in which there is cumulative inflation during the base period of at least 30 percent, as determined by reference to the consumer price index of the country listed in the monthly issues of International Financial Statistics, or a successor publication, of the International Monetary Fund. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(C), *base period* means, with respect to any taxable year, the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding the last day of such taxable year (see § 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D)). Accrued but unpaid taxes denominated in an inflationary currency shall be translated into dollars at the exchange rate on the last day of the United States taxable year to which such taxes relate.

(D) *Election to translate taxes using exchange rate for date of payment.* A taxpayer that is otherwise required to translate foreign income taxes that are denominated in foreign currency using the average exchange rate may elect to translate foreign income taxes described in this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of the foreign taxes, provided that the liability for such taxes is denominated in nonfunctional currency. A taxpayer may make an election under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) for all foreign income taxes, or for only those foreign income taxes that are denominated in nonfunctional currency and are attributable to qualified business units with United States dollar functional currencies. The election must be made by attaching a statement to the taxpayer's timely filed return (including extensions) for the first taxable year to which the election applies. The statement must identify whether the election is made for all foreign taxes or only for foreign taxes attributable to qualified business units with United States dollar functional currencies. Once made, the election shall apply for the taxable year for which made and all subsequent taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Commissioner. Accrued but unpaid taxes subject to an election under this paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) shall be translated into dollars at the exchange rate on the last day of the United States taxable year to which such taxes relate. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004, and before November 7, 2007, the rules of Notice 2006-47, 2006-20 IRB 892 (see § 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(*b*)), shall apply.

(E) *Regulated investment companies.* In the case of a regulated investment company (as defined in section 851 and the regulations under that section) which takes into account income on an accrual basis, foreign income taxes paid or accrued with respect to such income shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date the income accrues.

(2) *Translation of foreign taxes taken into account when paid.* In the case of a taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when paid, the amount of any foreign tax liability denominated in foreign currency, additional tax liability denominated in foreign currency, or estimated taxes paid in foreign currency shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date of payment of such foreign taxes. Foreign taxes withheld in foreign currency shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate as of the date on which such taxes were withheld.

(3) *Refunds or other reductions of foreign tax liability.* In the case of a taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when accrued, a reduction in the amount of previously-accrued foreign taxes that is attributable to a refund of foreign taxes denominated in foreign currency, a credit allowed in lieu of a refund, the correction of an overaccrual, or an adjustment on account of accrued taxes denominated in foreign currency that were not paid by the date two years after the close of the taxable year to which such taxes relate, shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or added to post-1986 foreign income taxes. In the case of foreign income taxes taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the date of payment, see paragraph (d) of this section for required adjustments to reflect a reduction in the amount of previously-accrued foreign taxes that is attributable to a difference in exchange rates between the date of accrual and date of payment. In the case of a taxpayer that takes foreign income taxes into account when paid, a refund or other reduction in the amount of foreign taxes denominated in foreign currency shall be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit. If a refund or other reduction of foreign taxes relates to foreign taxes paid or accrued on more than one date, then the refund or other reduction shall be deemed to be derived from, and shall reduce, the last payment of foreign taxes first, to the extent of that payment. See paragraphs (d)(1) (redetermination of United States tax liability for foreign taxes paid directly by a United States person) and (d)(2)(ii) (method of adjustment of a foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes) of this section.

(4) *Allocation of refunds of foreign tax.* Refunds of foreign tax shall be allocated to the same separate category as foreign taxes to which the refunded taxes relate. Refunds are related to foreign taxes of a separate category if the foreign tax that was refunded was imposed with respect to that separate category. See section 904(d) and § 1.904-6 concerning the allocation of taxes to separate categories of income. Earnings and profits of a foreign corporation in the separate category to which the refund relates shall be increased to reflect the foreign tax refund.

(5) *Basis of foreign currency refunded* - (i) *In general.* A recipient of a refund of foreign tax shall determine its basis in the currency refunded under the following rules.

(ii) *United States dollar functional currency.* If the functional currency of the qualified business unit (QBU) (as defined in section 989 and the regulations under that section) that paid the tax and received the refund is the United States dollar or the person receiving the refund is not a QBU, then the recipient's basis in the foreign currency refunded shall be the dollar value of the refund determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section by using, as appropriate, either the average exchange rate for the taxable year to which such taxes relate or the other exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or added to post-1986 foreign income taxes.

(iii) *Nondollar functional currency.* If the functional currency of the QBU receiving the refund is not the United States dollar and is different from the currency in which the foreign tax was paid, then the recipient's basis in the foreign currency refunded shall be equal to the functional currency value of the non-functional currency refund translated into functional currency at the exchange rate between the functional currency and the non-functional currency. Such exchange rate is determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section by substituting the words “functional currency” for the word “dollar” and by using, as appropriate, either the average exchange rate for the taxable year to which such taxes relate or the other exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally claimed as a credit or added to post-1986 foreign income taxes.

(iv) *Functional currency tax liabilities.* If the functional currency of the QBU receiving the refund is the currency in which the refund was made, then the recipient's basis in the currency received shall be the amount of the functional currency received.

(v) *Foreign currency gain or loss.* For purposes of determining foreign currency gain or loss on the initial payment of accrued foreign tax in a non-functional currency, see section 988. For purposes of determining subsequent foreign currency gain or loss on the disposition of non-functional currency the basis of which is determined under this paragraph (b)(5), see section 988(c)(1)(C).

(c) *Foreign tax redetermination.* For purposes of this section and § 1.905-4T, the term *foreign tax redetermination* means a change in the foreign tax liability that may affect a taxpayer's foreign tax credit. A foreign tax redetermination includes: accrued taxes that when paid differ from the amounts added to post-1986 foreign income taxes or claimed as credits by the taxpayer (such as corrections to overaccruals and additional payments); accrued taxes that are not paid before the date two years after the close of the taxable year to which such taxes relate; any tax paid that is refunded in whole or in part; and, for taxes taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars on the date of payment, a difference between the dollar value of the accrued tax and the dollar value of the tax paid attributable to fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency relative to the dollar between the date of accrual and the date of payment.

(d) *Redetermination of United States tax liability* - (1) *Foreign taxes paid directly by a United States person.* If a foreign tax redetermination occurs with respect to foreign tax paid or accrued by or on behalf of a United States taxpayer, then a redetermination of the United States tax liability is required for the taxable year for which the foreign tax was claimed as a credit. See § 1.905-4T(b) which requires notification to the IRS of a foreign tax redetermination with respect to which a redetermination of United States liability is required, and see section 905(b) and the regulations under that section which require that a taxpayer substantiate that a foreign tax was paid and provide all necessary information establishing its entitlement to the foreign tax credit. However, a redetermination of United States tax liability is not required (and a taxpayer need not notify the IRS) if the foreign taxes are taken into account when accrued but translated into dollars as of the date of payment, the difference between the dollar value of the accrued tax and the dollar value of the tax paid is attributable to fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency relative to the dollar between the date of accrual and the date of payment, and the amount of the foreign tax redetermination with respect to each foreign country is less than the lesser of ten thousand dollars or two percent of the total dollar amount of the foreign tax initially accrued with respect to that foreign country for the United States taxable year. In such case, an appropriate adjustment shall be made to the taxpayer's United States tax liability in the taxable year during which the foreign tax redetermination occurs.

(2) *Foreign taxes deemed paid under sections 902 or 960* - (i) *Redetermination of United States tax liability not required.* Subject to the special rule of paragraph (d)(3) of this section, a redetermination of United States tax liability is not required to account for the effect of a redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation on the foreign taxes deemed paid by a United States corporation under section 902 or 960. Instead, appropriate upward or downward adjustments shall be made, in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, at the time of the foreign tax redetermination to the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes to reflect the effect of the foreign tax redetermination in calculating foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to distributions and inclusions (and the amount of such distributions and inclusions) that are includible in the United States taxable year in which the foreign tax redetermination occurred and subsequent taxable years. See § 1.905-4T(b)(2) for notification requirements where a redetermination of foreign tax paid or accrued by a foreign corporation affects the computation of foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960, and the taxpayer is required to adjust the foreign corporation's pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes under this paragraph (d)(2).

(ii) *Adjustments to the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes* - (A) *Reduction in foreign tax paid or accrued.* A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate category shall be reduced by the United States dollar amount of a foreign tax refund or other reduction in the amount of foreign tax paid or accrued, translated into United States dollars as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings in the appropriate separate category shall be increased by the functional currency amount of the foreign tax refund or other reduction in the amount of foreign tax paid or accrued. The allocation of the refund or other adjustment to the appropriate separate categories shall be made in accordance with paragraph (b)(4) of this section and § 1.904-6. If a foreign corporation receives a refund of foreign tax in a currency other than its functional currency, that refund shall be translated into its functional currency, for purposes of computing the increase to its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings, at the exchange rate between the functional currency and the non-functional currency, as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, by substituting the words “functional currency” for the word “dollar” and by using the same average or spot rate exchange rate convention that applies for purposes of translating such foreign taxes into United States dollars.

(B) *Additional foreign tax paid or accrued.* A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the appropriate separate category shall be increased by the United States dollar amount of the additional foreign tax paid or accrued, translated in accordance with the rules of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. A foreign corporation's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings in the appropriate separate category shall be decreased by the functional currency amount of the additional foreign tax paid or accrued. The allocation of the additional amount of foreign tax among the separate categories shall be made in accordance with § 1.904-6. If a foreign corporation pays or accrues foreign tax in a currency other than its functional currency, that tax shall be translated into its functional currency, for purposes of computing the decrease to its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings, at the exchange rate between the functional currency and the non-functional currency, as determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section, by substituting the words “functional currency” for the word “dollar” and by using the same average or spot rate exchange rate convention that applies for purposes of translating such foreign taxes into United States dollars.

(C) *Refunds of foreign taxes of lower tier foreign corporations that cause deficits in foreign tax pools.* If a lower tier foreign corporation receives a refund of foreign tax after making a distribution to an upper tier foreign corporation and the refund would have the effect of reducing below zero the lower tier corporation's pool of foreign taxes in any separate category, then both the lower tier and upper tier corporations shall adjust the appropriate pool of foreign taxes to reflect that refund. The upper tier foreign corporation shall adjust its pool of foreign taxes by the difference between the United States dollar amount of foreign tax deemed paid by the upper tier foreign corporation prior to the refund and the United States dollar amount of foreign tax recomputed as if the refund occurred prior to the distribution. The upper tier foreign corporation shall not make any adjustment to its earnings and profits because foreign taxes deemed paid by the upper tier corporation are not included in the upper tier corporation's earnings and profits. The lower tier foreign corporation shall adjust its pool of foreign taxes by the difference between the United States dollar amount of the refund and the United States dollar amount of the adjustment to the upper tier foreign corporation's pool of foreign taxes. The earnings and profits of the lower tier foreign corporation shall be adjusted to reflect the full amount of the refund. The provisions of this paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) do not apply to distributions or inclusions to a United States person. See paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section for rules relating to actual or deemed distributions made to a United States person.

(D) *Examples.* The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (d)(2):

Example 1.Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P are calendar year taxpayers. CFC has a functional currency, the u, other than the dollar and its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings is maintained in that currency. CFC and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign taxes. In 2008, CFC accrued and paid 100u of foreign income taxes with respect to non-subpart F income. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1u. In 2009, CFC received a refund of 50u of foreign taxes with respect to its non-subpart F income in 2008. CFC made no distributions to P in 2008. In accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(A) of this section and subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this section, in 2009 CFC's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes must be reduced by $50 (because the refund must be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when added to CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008) and the CFC's pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by 50u (because the post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by the functional currency amount of the refund received). An income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC is not required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC's functional currency.Example 2.The facts are the same as in *Example 1,* except that in 2008, CFC had general category post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to non-subpart F income of 200u (net of foreign taxes), and CFC accrued and paid 160u in foreign income taxes with respect to those earnings. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1u. Also in 2008, CFC made a distribution to P of 50u, and P was deemed to have paid $40 of foreign taxes with respect to that distribution (50u/200u × $160). In 2009, CFC received a refund of foreign taxes of 5u with respect to its nonsubpart F income in 2008. Also in 2009, CFC made a distribution to P of 50u. CFC had no income and paid no foreign taxes in 2009. In accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, CFC's pool of general category post-1986 foreign income taxes is reduced in 2009 by $5 to $115 (because the refund must be translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when added to CFC's post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008), and CFC's pool of general category post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased in 2009 by 5u to 155u (because the post-1986 undistributed earnings must be increased by the functional currency amount of the refund received). (An income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC is not required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC's functional currency.) A redetermination of P's deemed paid credit and U.S. tax for 2008 is not required, because the 5u refund, if taken into account in 2008, would have reduced P's deemed paid taxes by less than 10% (50u/205u × $155 = $37.80). See paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. P is deemed to pay $37.10 of foreign taxes with respect to the distribution in 2009 of 50u (50u/155u × $115).Example 3.(i) CFC1 is a foreign corporation that is wholly-owned by P, a domestic corporation. CFC2 is a foreign corporation that is wholly-owned by CFC1. The functional currency of CFC1 and CFC2 is the u, and the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings of CFC1 and CFC2 are maintained in that currency. CFC1, CFC2, and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign income taxes. In 2008, CFC2 had post-1986 undistributed earnings attributable to non-subpart F income of 100u (net of foreign taxes) and paid 100u in foreign income taxes with respect to those earnings. The average exchange rate for 2008 was $1:1u. CFC1 had no income and no earnings and profits other than those resulting from distributions from CFC2, as provided in either Situation 1 or Situation 2. CFC1 paid no foreign taxes.

(ii) *Situation 1.* In 2009, CFC2 received a refund of foreign taxes of 25u with respect to its 2008 taxable year. As of the close of 2009, CFC2 had 125u of post-1986 undistributed earnings (100u + 25u) and $75 of post-1986 foreign income taxes ($100−$25). In 2010, CFC2 made a distribution to CFC1 of 50u. CFC1 was deemed to have paid $30 of foreign taxes with respect to that distribution (50u/125u × $75). (An income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC1 is not required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC1's functional currency.) At the end of 2010, CFC2 had 75u of post-1986 undistributed earnings (125u−50u) and $45 of post-1986 foreign income taxes ($75−$30).

(iii) *Situation 2.* The facts are the same as in *Example 3(ii), Situation 1,* except that CFC2 made a distribution of 50u in 2009 and received a refund of 75u of foreign tax in 2010. In 2009, the amount of foreign taxes deemed paid by CFC1 is $50 (50u/100u × $100). In accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, the pools of post-1986 foreign income taxes of CFC1, as well as CFC2, must be adjusted in 2010, because the 2010 refund would otherwise have the effect of reducing below zero CFC2's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes. Under paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, the pools would have to be adjusted in 2009, and a redetermination of P's United States tax liability would be required, if P had received or accrued a distribution or inclusion from CFC1 or CFC2 in 2009 and computed an amount of foreign taxes deemed paid. CFC1's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes must be reduced in 2010 by $42.86, determined as follows: $50 (foreign taxes deemed paid on the distribution from CFC2) minus $7.14 (the foreign taxes that would have been deemed paid had the refund occurred prior to the distribution (50u/175u × $25)). CFC2's pool of foreign taxes must be reduced in 2010 by $32.14, determined as follows: $75 (75u refund translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally added to post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008) minus $42.86 (the adjustment to CFC1's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes). (An income adjustment reflecting foreign currency gain or loss under section 988 with respect to the refund of foreign taxes received by CFC1 is not required because the foreign taxes are denominated and paid in CFC1's functional currency.) The following reflects the pools of post-1986 undistributed earnings and post-1986 foreign income taxes of CFC1 and CFC2.

|     |Post-1986 earnings (u)|Foreign taxes ($)|
|-----|----------------------|-----------------|
|CFC2:|                      |                 |
|2008 |         100          |       100       |
|2009 |     100−50 = 50      |   100−50 = 50   |
|2010 |    50 + 75 = 125     |50−32.14 = 17.86 |
|CFC1:|                      |                 |
|2009 |          50          |       50        |
|2010 |          50          | 50−42.86 = 7.14 |

(3) *Exceptions.* The provisions of paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not apply and a redetermination of United States tax liability is required to account for the effect of a redetermination of foreign tax on foreign taxes deemed paid by a United States corporation under section 902 or section 960 to the extent provided in this paragraph (d)(3).

(i) *Hyperinflationary currencies.* A redetermination of United States tax liability is required if the foreign tax liability is in a hyperinflationary currency. The term “hyperinflationary currency” means the currency of a country in which there is cumulative inflation during the base period of at least 100% as determined by reference to the consumer price index of the country listed in the monthly issues of International Financial Statistics, or a successor publication, of the International Monetary Fund. “Base period” means, with respect to any taxable year, the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding the last day of such taxable year (see § 1.985-2T(b)(2)).

(ii) *Deemed paid foreign tax adjustment of ten percent or more.* A redetermination of United States tax liability is required if a foreign tax redetermination occurs with respect to foreign taxes paid by a foreign corporation and such foreign tax redetermination, if taken into account in the taxable year of the foreign corporation to which the foreign tax redetermination relates, has the effect of reducing by ten percent or more the domestic corporate shareholder's foreign taxes deemed paid under section 902 or 960 with respect to a distribution or inclusion from the foreign corporation in any taxable year of the domestic corporate shareholder. If a redetermination of United States tax is required under the preceding sentence for any taxable year, a redetermination of United States tax is also required for all subsequent taxable years in which the domestic corporate shareholder received or accrued a distribution or inclusion from the foreign corporation.

(iii) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section:

Example.(i) *Facts.* Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P use the calendar year as their taxable year. CFC has a functional currency, the u, other than the dollar, and its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings is maintained in that currency. CFC and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign income taxes. As of January 1, 2008, CFC had 500u of general category post-1986 undistributed earnings and $200 of general category post-1986 foreign income taxes. In 2008, when the average exchange rate for the year was $1:1u, CFC earned general category income of 600u, accrued 100u of foreign income tax with respect to that income, and made a distribution to P of 100u, 10% of CFC's post-1986 undistributed earnings of 1,000u. P was deemed to have paid $30 of foreign income taxes in 2008 with respect to that distribution (100u/1,000u × $300). In 2009, CFC paid its actual foreign tax liability for 2008 of 80u. Also in 2009, for which the average exchange rate was $1:1.5u, CFC earned 500u of general category income, accrued 150u of tax with respect to that income, and distributed 100u to P. In 2010, CFC incurred a general category loss of (500u) and accrued no foreign tax. The loss was carried back to 2008 for foreign tax purposes, and CFC received a refund in 2011 of all 80u of foreign taxes paid for its 2008 taxable year.

(ii) *Result in 2009.* If the 20u overaccrual of tax for 2008 were taken into account in 2008, CFC's general category post-1986 undistributed earnings would be 1,020u, CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes would be $280, and P would be deemed to pay $27.45 of tax with respect to the 2008 distribution of 100u (100u/1020u × $280 = $27.45). Because $2.55 is less than 10% of the $30 of foreign taxes deemed paid as originally calculated in 2008, P is not required to redetermine its deemed paid credit and U.S. tax liability for 2008 in 2009. Instead, CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes are reduced by $20 in 2009 (because the overaccrual for 2008 is translated into dollars using the exchange rate that was used to translate such amount when originally added to post-1986 foreign income taxes, that is, $1:1u, the average exchange rate for 2008), and the corresponding pool of general category post-1986 undistributed earnings is increased by 20u in 2009 (because the post-1986 undistributed earnings pool is increased by the functional currency amount of the overaccrual). CFC's general category post-1986 undistributed earnings are also increased in 2009 to 1270u by the 350u earned in 2009 (900u + 20u + 350u = 1270u), and CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes are increased by $100 to $350 ($270 − $20 + $100). P is deemed to pay $27.56 of foreign income taxes in 2009 with respect to the 100u distribution from CFC in that year (100u/1270u × $350).

(iii) *Result in 2011.* If the 80u refund of tax for 2008 were taken into account in 2008, CFC's general category post-1986 undistributed earnings would be 1,100u, CFC's general category post-1986 foreign income taxes would be $200, and P would be deemed to pay $18.18 of tax with respect to the 2008 distribution of 100u (100u/1,100u × $200 = $18.18). Because $11.82 is more than 10% of the $30 of foreign taxes deemed paid as originally calculated in 2008, under paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section, P is required to redetermine its deemed paid credit and U.S. tax liability for 2008 and 2009 in 2011. As determined in 2011, CFC's post-1986 undistributed earnings for 2009 are 1350u (1,100u as revised for 2008, less 100u distributed in 2008, plus 350u earned in 2009), and its post-1986 foreign income taxes for 2009 are $281.82 ($200 as revised for 2008, less $18.18 deemed paid in 2008, plus $100 accrued for 2009). As redetermined in 2011, P's deemed paid credit with respect to the 100u distribution from CFC in 2009 is $20.88 (100u/1350u × $281.82).

(iv) *Deficit in foreign tax pool.* A redetermination of United States tax liability is required if a foreign tax redetermination occurs with respect to foreign taxes deemed paid with respect to a subpart F inclusion or an actual distribution which has the effect of reducing below zero the distributing foreign corporation's pool of foreign taxes in any separate category. Whether a foreign corporation's pool of foreign taxes is reduced below zero shall be determined at the close of the taxable year of the foreign corporation in which the foreign tax redetermination occurred. In no case shall taxes paid or accrued with respect to one separate category be applied to offset a negative balance in any other separate category.

(v) *Example.* The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section:

Example.Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of its domestic parent, P. Both CFC and P are calendar year taxpayers. CFC has a functional currency, the u, other than the dollar, and its pool of post-1986 undistributed earnings is maintained in that currency. CFC and P use the average exchange rate to translate foreign taxes. The average exchange rate for both 2008 and 2009 was $1:1u. In 2008, CFC earned 200u of general category income, accrued and paid 100u of foreign taxes with respect to that income, and made a distribution to P of 50u, half of CFC's post-1986 undistributed earnings of 100u. P is deemed to have paid $50 of foreign taxes with respect to that distribution (50u/100u × $100). In 2009, CFC received a refund of all 100u of foreign taxes related to the general category income for 2008. In 2009, CFC earned an additional 290u of income, 200u of which was passive category income and 90u of which was general category income, and accrued and paid 95u of foreign tax, 40u of which was with respect to the passive category income and 45u of which was with respect to the general category income. In accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section, P is required to redetermine its United States tax liability for 2008 to account for the foreign tax redetermination occurring in 2009 because, if an adjustment to CFC's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in the general category were made, the pool would be ($5). A deficit is not permitted to be carried in CFC's pool of post-1986 foreign income taxes in any separate category.

(vi) *Reduction of corporate level tax on distribution of earnings and profits.* If a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation receives a distribution out of previously taxed earnings and profits and a foreign country has imposed tax on the income of the controlled foreign corporation, which tax is reduced on distribution of the earnings and profits of the corporation, then the United States shareholder shall redetermine its United States tax liability for the year or years affected.

(e) *Foreign tax imposed on foreign refund.* If the redetermination of foreign tax for a taxable year or years is occasioned by the refund to the taxpayer of taxes paid to a foreign country or possession of the United States and the foreign country or possession imposed tax on the refund, then the amount of the refund shall be considered to be reduced by the amount of any tax described in section 901 imposed by the foreign country or possession of the United States with respect to such refund. In such case, no other credit under section 901, and no deduction under section 164, shall be allowed for any taxable year with respect to such tax imposed on such refund.

(f) *Expiration date.* The applicability of this section expires on or before November 5, 2010.
