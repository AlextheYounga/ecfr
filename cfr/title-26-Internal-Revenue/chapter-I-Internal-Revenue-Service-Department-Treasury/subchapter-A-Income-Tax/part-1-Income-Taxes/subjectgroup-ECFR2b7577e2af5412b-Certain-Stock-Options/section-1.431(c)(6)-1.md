##### § 1.431(c)(6)-1 Mortality tables used to determine current liability. #####

(a) *Mortality tables used to determine current liability.* The mortality assumptions that apply to a defined benefit plan for the plan year pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(A) and § 1.430(h)(3)-1(a)(2) are used to determine a multiemployer plan's current liability for purposes of applying the rules of section 431(c)(6).

However, for this purpose, a multiemployer plan is not permitted to use substitute mortality tables under § 1.430(h)(3)-2.

(b) *Effective/applicability date.* This section applies for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2008.
