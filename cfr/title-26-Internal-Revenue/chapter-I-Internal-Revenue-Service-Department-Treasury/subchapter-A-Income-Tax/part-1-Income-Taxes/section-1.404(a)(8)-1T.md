##### ยง 1.404(a)(8)-1T Deductions for plan contributions on behalf of self-employed individuals. (Temporary) #####

Q: How does the amendment to section 404(a)(8)(D), made by section 713(d)(6) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA of 1984), affect section 404(a)(8)(C)?

A: In applying the rules of section 404(a)(8)(C), the Service will treat the amendment to section 404(a)(8)(D) as also having been made to section 404(a)(8)(C), pending enactment of technical corrections to TRA of 1984. The effect of treating the amendment as having also been made to section 404(a)(8)(C) is to increase the amount of contributions on behalf of a self-employed individual that will be treated as satisfying section 162 or 212. Generally, therefore, a contribution on behalf of a self-employed individual is treated as satisfying section 162 or 212 if it is not in excess of the individual's earned income for the year, determined without regard to the deduction allowed by section 404 for the self-employed individual's contribution.
