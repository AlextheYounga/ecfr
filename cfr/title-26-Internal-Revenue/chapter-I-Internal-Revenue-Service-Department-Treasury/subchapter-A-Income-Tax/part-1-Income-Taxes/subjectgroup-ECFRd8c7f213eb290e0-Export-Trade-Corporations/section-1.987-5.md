##### § 1.987-5 Recognition of section 987 gain or loss. #####

(a) *Recognition of section 987 gain or loss by the owner of a section 987 QBU.* The taxable income of an owner of a section 987 QBU shall include the owner's section 987 gain or loss recognized with respect to the section 987 QBU for the taxable year. Except as otherwise provided, for any taxable year the owner's section 987 gain or loss recognized with respect to a section 987 QBU shall equal:

(1) The owner's net unrecognized section 987 gain or loss with respect to the section 987 QBU determined under § 1.987-4 on the last day of such taxable year (or, if earlier, on the day the section 987 QBU is terminated under § 1.987-8); multiplied by

(2) The owner's remittance proportion for the taxable year, as determined under paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) *Remittance proportion.* The owner's remittance proportion with respect to a section 987 QBU for a taxable year shall equal:

(1) The remittance, as determined under paragraph (c) of this section, to the owner from the section 987 QBU for such taxable year; divided by

(2) The sum of

(A) The aggregate adjusted basis of the gross assets of the section 987 QBU as of the end of the taxable year that are reflected on its year-end balance sheet translated into the owner's functional currency as provided in § 1.987-4(e)(2) and

(B) The amount of the remittance as determined under paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) *Remittance*—(1) *Definition.* A remittance shall be determined in the owner's functional currency and shall equal the excess, if any, of:

(i) The aggregate of all amounts transferred from the section 987 QBU to the owner during the taxable year, as determined in paragraph (d) of this section; over

(ii) The aggregate of all amounts transferred from the owner to the section 987 QBU during the taxable year, as determined in paragraph (e) of this section.

(2) *Day when a remittance is determined.* An owner's remittance from a section 987 QBU shall be determined on the last day of the owner's taxable year (or, if earlier, on the day the section 987 QBU is terminated under § 1.987-8).

(3) *Termination.* A termination of a section 987 QBU as determined under § 1.987-8 is treated as a remittance of all the gross assets of the section 987 QBU to the owner on the date of such termination. See § 1.987-8(e). Accordingly, the remittance proportion in the case of a termination is 1.

(d) *Aggregate of all amounts transferred from the section 987 QBU to the owner for the taxable year.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the aggregate amount transferred from the section 987 QBU to the owner for the taxable year shall be the aggregate amount of functional currency and the aggregate adjusted basis of the assets transferred, as determined in the owner's functional currency under § 1.987-4(d)(2). Solely for this purpose, the amount of liabilities transferred from the owner to the section 987 QBU, as determined in the owner's functional currency under § 1.987-4(d)(5), shall be treated as a transfer of assets from the section 987 QBU to the owner in an amount equal to the amount of such liabilities.

(e) *Aggregate of all amounts transferred from the owner to the section 987 QBU for the taxable year.* For purposes of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the aggregate of all amounts transferred from the owner to the section 987 QBU for the taxable year shall be the aggregate amount of functional currency and the aggregate adjusted basis of the assets transferred, as determined in the owner's functional currency under § 1.987-4(d)(3). Solely for this purpose, the amount of liabilities transferred from the section 987 QBU to the owner determined under § 1.987-4(d)(4) shall be treated as a transfer of assets from the owner to the section 987 QBU in an amount equal to the amount of such liabilities.

(f) *Determination of owner's adjusted basis in transferred assets*—(1) *In general.* The owner's adjusted basis in an asset received in a transfer from a section 987 QBU (whether or not such transfer is made in connection with a remittance, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section) shall be determined in the owner's functional currency under the rules prescribed in paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this section.

(2) *Marked asset.* The basis of a marked asset shall be the amount determined by translating the section 987 QBU's functional currency basis of the asset, after taking into account § 1.988-1(a)(10), into the owner's functional currency at the spot rate (as defined in § 1.987-1(c)(1)) applicable to the date of transfer.

(3) *Historic asset.* The basis of a historic asset shall be the amount determined by translating the section 987 QBU's functional currency basis of the asset, after taking into account § 1.988-1(a)(10), into the owner's functional currency at the historic rate for the asset (as defined in § 1.987-1(c)(3)).

(g) *Example.* The following example illustrates the calculation of section 987 gain or loss under this section:

Example.(i) U.S. Corp, a domestic corporation with the dollar as its functional currency, operates in the United Kingdom through Business A, a section 987 QBU with the pound as its functional currency. During 2021, the following transfers took place between U.S. Corp and Business A. On January 5, 2021, U.S. Corp transferred to Business A $300, which Business A used during the year to purchase services. On March 5, 2021, Business A transferred a machine to U.S. Corp. The pound adjusted basis of the machine when properly translated into dollars as described under § 1.987-4(d)(2)(ii)(B) and paragraph (d) of this section is $500. On November 1, 2021, Business A transferred pounds to U.S. Corp. The dollar amount of the pounds when properly translated as described under § 1.987-4(d)(2)(ii)(A) and paragraph (d) of this section is $2,300. On December 7, 2021, U.S. Corp transferred a truck to Business A with an adjusted basis of $2,000.

(ii) At the end of 2021, Business A holds assets, properly translated into the owner's functional currency pursuant to § 1.987-4(e)(2), consisting of a computer with a pound adjusted basis equivalent to $500, a truck with a pound adjusted basis equivalent to $2,000, and pounds equivalent to $2,850. In addition, Business A has a pound liability entered into in 2020 with Bank A. All such assets and liabilities are reflected on the books and records of Business A. Assume that the net unrecognized section 987 gain for Business A as determined under § 1.987-4 as of the last day of 2021 is $80.

(iii) U.S. Corp's section 987 gain with respect to Business A is determined as follows:

(A) *Computation of amount of remittance.* Under paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, U.S. Corp must determine the amount of the remittance for 2021 in the owner's functional currency (dollars) on the last day of 2021. The amount of the remittance for 2021 is $500, determined as follows:

Transfers from Business A to U.S. Corp in dollars:

|                                                |     |
|------------------------------------------------|-----|
|                    Machine                     |$500 |

|Aggregate transfers from U.S. Corp to Business A|2,300|

Computation of amount of remittance:

|                                                      |       |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------|
|   Aggregate transfers from Business A to U.S. Corp   |$2,800 |
|Less: aggregate transfers from U.S. Corp to Business A|(2,300)|
|                   Total remittance                   |  500  |

(B) *Computation of section 987 QBU gross assets plus remittance.* Under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, Business A must determine the aggregate basis of its gross assets that are reflected on its year-end balance sheet translated into the owner's functional currency and must increase this amount by the amount of the remittance.

|                                                                                              |     |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
|                                           Computer                                           |$500 |
|                                            Pounds                                            |2,850|
|                                            Truck                                             |2,000|
|                                    Aggregate gross assets                                    |5,350|
|                                          Remittance                                          | 500 |
|Aggregate basis of Business A's gross assets at end of 2021, increased by amount of remittance|5,850|

(C) *Computation of remittance proportion.* Under paragraph (b) of this section, Business A must compute the remittance proportion by dividing the $500 remittance amount by the $5,850 sum of the aggregate basis of Business A's gross assets and the amount of the remittance. The resulting remittance proportion is 0.085.

(D) *Computation of section 987 gain or loss.* The amount of U.S. Corp's section 987 gain or loss that must be recognized with respect to Business A is determined under paragraph (a) of this section by multiplying the 0.085 remittance proportion by the $80 of net unrecognized section 987 gain. U.S. Corp's resulting recognized section 987 gain for 2021 is $6.80.
