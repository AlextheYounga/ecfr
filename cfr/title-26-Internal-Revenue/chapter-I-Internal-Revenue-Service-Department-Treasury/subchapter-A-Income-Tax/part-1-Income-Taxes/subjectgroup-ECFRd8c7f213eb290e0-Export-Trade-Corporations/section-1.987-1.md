(b) *Scope of section 987 and definitions* - (1) *Taxpayers subject to section 987* - (i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(1)(ii) and (b)(6) of this section, an individual or corporation is subject to these regulations under section 987 if such person is an owner (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) of an eligible QBU (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that is a section 987 QBU (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).

(ii) *Inapplicability to certain entities.* Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, these regulations under section 987 do not apply to specified entities described in this paragraph (b)(1)(ii), other than specified entities that engage in transactions primarily with related persons within the meaning of section 267(b) or section 707(b) that are not themselves specified entities. For this purpose, specified entities means banks, insurance companies, leasing companies, finance coordination centers, regulated investment companies, or real estate investment trusts. Further, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, these regulations do not apply to trusts, estates, S corporations, and partnerships other than section 987 aggregate partnerships (as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section).

(iii) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.987-1T(b)(1)(iii).

(2) *Definition of a section 987 QBU* - (i) *In general.* A section 987 QBU is an eligible QBU (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that has a functional currency different from its direct owner. A section 987 QBU also includes the assets and liabilities of an eligible QBU that are considered under paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section to be a section 987 QBU of a partner in a section 987 aggregate partnership (as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section). A section 987 QBU will continue to be treated as a section 987 QBU of the owner until a sale or other termination of the section 987 QBU as described in § 1.987-8(b). Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section, the functional currency of an eligible QBU shall be determined under § 1.985-1.

(ii) *Section 987 QBU grouping election* - (A) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, an owner may elect to treat, solely for purposes of section 987, all section 987 QBUs with the same functional currency that it directly owns as a single section 987 QBU.

(B) *Special grouping rules for section 987 QBUs owned indirectly through a section 987 aggregate partnership.* An owner may elect to treat all section 987 QBUs with the same functional currency owned indirectly through a single section 987 aggregate partnership (as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) as a single section 987 QBU. An owner may not treat section 987 QBUs as a single section 987 QBU if such QBUs are owned indirectly through different section 987 aggregate partnerships. Additionally, an owner may not treat section 987 QBUs that are owned both directly and indirectly through a section 987 aggregate partnership as a single section 987 QBU.

(3) *Definition of an eligible QBU* - (i) *In general.* Eligible QBU means a qualified business unit, as defined in § 1.989(a)-1, that is not subject to the Dollar Approximate Separate Transactions Method rules of § 1.985-3.

(ii) *Exclusion of certain entities.* A corporation, partnership, trust, estate, or entity disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for Federal income tax purposes as described in § 301.7701-2(c)(2) (hereafter referred to as a “DE”) is not an eligible QBU (even though such an entity may have activities that qualify as an eligible QBU).

(4) *Definition of owner.* For purposes of these regulations under section 987, an owner is any person having direct or indirect ownership in an eligible QBU. Only an individual or corporation may be an owner of an eligible QBU. The term *owner* for section 987 purposes does not include an eligible QBU. For example, a section 987 QBU (QBU1) is not an owner of another section 987 QBU (QBU2) even if QBU1 owns the stock of QBU2.

(i) *Direct ownership.* An individual or a corporation is a direct owner of an eligible QBU if the individual or corporation is the owner for Federal income tax purposes of the assets and liabilities of the eligible QBU.

(ii) *Indirect ownership.* An individual or corporation that is a partner in a section 987 aggregate partnership (as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section) and is allocated, under § 1.987-7, all or a portion of the assets and liabilities of an eligible QBU of such partnership is an indirect owner of the eligible QBU.

(5) *Section 987 aggregate partnership* - (i) *In general.* A partnership is a section 987 aggregate partnership if:

(A) All of the interests in partnership capital and profits are owned, directly or indirectly, by persons related to each other within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b). For purposes of this paragraph (b)(5), ownership of an interest in partnership capital or profits is determined in accordance with the rules for constructive ownership provided in section 267(c), other than section 267(c)(3); and

(B) The partnership has one or more eligible QBUs, at least one of which would be a section 987 QBU with respect to a partner if the partner owned the eligible QBU directly.

(ii) *Section 987 QBU of a partner.* The assets and liabilities of an eligible QBU owned through a section 987 aggregate partnership and allocated to a partner under the principles of § 1.987-7(b) are considered to be a section 987 QBU of such partner if the partner has a functional currency different from that of the eligible QBU.

(iii) *Certain unrelated partners disregarded.* In determining whether a partnership is a section 987 aggregate partnership, the interest of an unrelated partner shall be disregarded if the acquisition of such interest has as a principal purpose the avoidance of this paragraph (b)(5).

(6) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.987-1T(b)(6).

(7) *Examples illustrating paragraph (b) of this section.* The following examples illustrate the principles of paragraph (b) of this section. U.S. Corp is a domestic corporation, has the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, and uses the calendar year as its taxable year. Except as otherwise provided, (i) Business A and Business B are eligible QBUs and have the euro and the Japanese yen, respectively, as their functional currencies and (ii) DE1 and DE2 are DEs, have no assets or liabilities, and conduct no activities.

Example 1.(i) *Facts.* U.S. Corp owns Business A and all of the interests in DE1. DE1 maintains a separate set of books and records that are kept in British pounds. DE1 owns pounds and all of the stock of a foreign corporation, FC. DE1 is liable to a lender on a pound-denominated obligation that was incurred to acquire the stock of FC. The FC stock, the pounds, and the liability incurred to acquire the FC stock are recorded on DE1's separate books and records. DE1 has no other assets or liabilities and conducts no activities (other than holding the FC stock and servicing its liability).

(ii) *Analysis.* (A) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, U.S. Corp is the direct owner of Business A because it is the owner of the assets and liabilities of Business A. Because Business A is an eligible QBU with a functional currency that is different from the functional currency of its owner, U.S. Corp, Business A is a section 987 QBU (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section). As a result, U.S. Corp and its section 987 QBU, Business A, are subject to section 987.

(B) Holding the stock of FC and pounds and servicing a liability does not constitute a trade or business within the meaning of § 1.989(a)-1(c). Because the activities of DE1 do not constitute a trade or business within the meaning of § 1.989(a)-1(c), such activities are not an eligible QBU. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, DE1 itself is not an eligible QBU. As a result, neither DE1 nor its activities qualify as a section 987 QBU of U.S. Corp. Therefore, neither the activities of DE1 nor DE1 itself is subject to section 987. For the foreign currency treatment of payments on DE1's pound-denominated liability, see § 1.988-2(b).

Example 2.(i) *Facts.* U.S. Corp owns all of the interests in DE1. DE1 owns Business A and all of the interests in DE2. The only activities of DE1 are Business A activities and holding the interests in DE2. DE2 owns Business B and Business C. For purposes of this example, Business B does not maintain books and records that are separate from its owner, DE2. Instead, the activities of Business B are reflected on the books and records of DE2, which are maintained in Japanese yen. In addition, Business C has the U.S. dollar as its functional currency, maintains books and records that are separate from the books and records of DE2, and is an eligible QBU.

(ii) *Analysis.* (A) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, DE1 and DE2 are not eligible QBUs. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, the Business B and Business C activities of DE2, and the Business A activities of DE1, are eligible QBUs. Moreover, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, DE1 is not the owner of the Business A, Business B, or Business C eligible QBUs, and DE2 is not the owner of the Business B or Business C eligible QBUs. Instead, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, U.S. Corp is the direct owner of the Business A, Business B, and Business C eligible QBUs.

(B) Because Business A and Business B are eligible QBUs with functional currencies that are different than the functional currency of U.S. Corp, Business A and Business B are section 987 QBUs (as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section).

(C) The Business C eligible QBU has the same functional currency as U.S. Corp. Therefore, the Business C eligible QBU is not a section 987 QBU.

Example 3.(i) *Facts.* U.S. Corp owns all of the interests in DE1. DE1 owns Business A and Business B. For purposes of this example, assume Business B has the euro as its functional currency.

(ii) *Analysis.* (A) Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, DE1 is not an eligible QBU. Moreover, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, DE1 is not the owner of the Business A or Business B eligible QBUs. Instead, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, U.S. Corp is the direct owner of the Business A and Business B eligible QBUs.

(B) Business A and Business B constitute two separate eligible QBUs, each with the euro as its functional currency. Accordingly, Business A and Business B are section 987 QBUs of U.S. Corp. U.S. Corp may elect to treat Business A and Business B as a single section 987 QBU pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section. If such election is made, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, U.S. Corp would be the direct owner of the Business AB section 987 QBU that would include the activities of both the Business A section 987 QBU and the Business B section 987 QBU. In addition, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, DE1 would not be treated as the owner of the Business AB section 987 QBU.

Example 4.(i) *Facts.* U.S. Corp owns all the stock of Y, a U.S. corporation that is a member of U.S. Corp's consolidated group. U.S. Corp also owns all the stock of CFC, a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in section 957(a)) of U.S. Corp with the Japanese yen as its functional currency. Y and CFC are the only partners in P, a foreign partnership. P owns DE1 and Business A. DE1 owns Business B.

(ii) *Analysis.* (A) Under paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section, P is a section 987 aggregate partnership because Y and CFC own all the interests in partnership capital and profits, Y and CFC are related within the meaning of section 267(b), and the requirements of § 1.987-1(b)(5)(i)(B) are satisfied. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, P and DE1 are not eligible QBUs. Moreover, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, for purposes of section 987, neither P nor DE1 is the owner of the Business B eligible QBU, and P is not the owner of the Business A eligible QBU. Instead, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section, Y and CFC are indirect owners of the Business A eligible QBU and the Business B eligible QBU to the extent they are allocated the assets and liabilities of such businesses under § 1.987-7.

(B) Because Business A and Business B are eligible QBUs with different functional currencies than Y, the portions of Business A and Business B allocated to Y under § 1.987-7 are section 987 QBUs of Y.

(C) Because the Business A eligible QBU has a different functional currency than CFC, the portion of Business A that is allocated to CFC under § 1.987-7 is a section 987 QBU, and CFC and its section 987 QBU are subject to section 987. Because the Business B eligible QBU has the same functional currency as CFC, the portion of Business B that is allocated to CFC under § 1.987-7 is not a section 987 QBU of CFC.

Example 5.(i) *Facts.* U.S. Corp owns all of the interests in DE1. DE1 owns Business A and all of the interests in DE2. DE2 owns Business B and all of the interests in DE3, an entity disregarded as an entity separate from its owner. DE3 owns Business C, which is an eligible QBU with the Russian ruble as its functional currency.

(ii) *Analysis.* Pursuant to paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, DE1, DE2, and DE3 are not eligible QBUs, and the Business A, Business B, and Business C activities are eligible QBUs. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, an eligible QBU is not an owner of another eligible QBU. Accordingly, the Business A eligible QBU is not the owner of the Business B eligible QBU, and the Business B eligible QBU is not the owner of the Business C eligible QBU. Instead, pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, U.S. Corp is the direct owner of the Business A, Business B, and Business C eligible QBUs. Because each of the Business A, Business B, and Business C eligible QBUs has a different functional currency than U.S. Corp, such eligible QBUs are section 987 QBUs of U.S. Corp.

(c) *Exchange rates.* Solely for purposes of section 987, the following definitions shall apply.

(1) *Spot rate* - (i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, the spot rate means the rate determined under the principles of § 1.988-1(d)(1), (2), and (4) on the relevant date.

(ii) *Election to use a spot rate convention* - (A) *In general - spot rate convention.* An owner may elect to use a spot rate convention that reasonably approximates the spot rate determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section in lieu of such spot rate. A spot rate convention may be determined with respect to a spot rate at the beginning of a reasonable period, the end of a reasonable period, as an average of spot rates for a reasonable period, or by reference to spot and forward rates for a reasonable period. For this purpose, a reasonable period shall not exceed three months. For example, in lieu of the spot rate determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the spot rate for all transactions during a monthly period can be determined pursuant to one of the following conventions: The spot rate at the beginning of the current month or at the end of the preceding month; the monthly average of daily spot rates for the current or preceding month; or an average of the beginning and ending spot rates for the current or preceding month. Similarly, in lieu of the spot rate determined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the spot rate can be determined pursuant to an average of the spot rate and the 30-day forward rate on a day of the preceding month. Use of a spot rate convention that is consistent with the convention used for financial accounting purposes is presumed to reasonably approximate the rate in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption if the Commissioner determines that the use of the convention would not clearly reflect income based on the facts and circumstances available at the time of the election.

(B) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.987-1T(c)(1)(ii)(B).

(iii) *Election to use spot rates in lieu of yearly average exchange rates.* A taxpayer may elect under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii) to use spot rates in lieu of yearly average exchange rates (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) for certain purposes. In particular, a taxpayer that makes this election must use the spot rate for purposes of determining the historic rate, as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, and for purposes of translating items of income, gain, deduction, or loss of a section 987 QBU into the owner's functional currency, as described in § 1.987-3(c)(1). Additionally, a taxpayer that makes this election will be deemed also to elect to use the historic inventory method described in § 1.987-3(c)(2)(iv)(B).

(2) *Yearly average exchange rate.* For purposes of section 987, the yearly average exchange rate is a rate that represents an average exchange rate for the taxable year (or, if the relevant period is less than a full taxable year, such portion of the taxable year) computed under any reasonable method. For example, an owner may determine the yearly average exchange rate based on a daily, monthly or quarterly averaging convention, whether weighted or unweighted, and may take into account forward rates for a period not to exceed three months. Use of an averaging convention that is consistent with the convention used for financial accounting purposes is presumed to be a reasonable method. The Commissioner can rebut this presumption if the Commissioner determines that the use of the convention would not have been expected to clearly reflect income based on the facts and circumstances available at the time of the election.

(3) *Historic rate* - (i) *In general.* Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, the historic rate is determined as described in paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) through (E) of this section.

(A) *Assets generally.* In the case of an asset other than inventory that is acquired by a section 987 QBU (including through a transfer), the historic rate is the yearly average exchange rate applicable to the year of acquisition.

(B) *Inventory under the simplified inventory method.* In the case of inventory with respect to which a taxpayer uses the simplified inventory method described in § 1.987-3(c)(2)(iv)(A), the historic rate for inventory accounted for under the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is the yearly average exchange rate applicable to the year in which the inventory's LIFO layer arose. The historic rate for all other inventory of such a taxpayer is the yearly average exchange rate for the taxable year for which the determination of the historic rate for such inventory is relevant.

(C) *Inventory under the historic inventory method.* In the case of inventory with respect to which a taxpayer has elected under § 1.987- 3(c)(2)(iv)(B) to use the historic inventory method, each inventoriable cost with respect to such inventory may have a different historic rate. The historic rate for each inventoriable cost is the exchange rate at which such item would be translated under § 1.987-3 if it were not an inventoriable cost.

(D) *Liabilities generally.* In the case of a liability that is incurred or assumed by a section 987 QBU, the historic rate is the yearly average exchange rate applicable to the year the liability is incurred or assumed.

(E) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.987-1T(c)(3)(i)(E).

(ii) *Historic rate when an election to use spot rates in lieu of yearly average exchange rates is in effect.* A taxpayer that has elected under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section to use spot rates in lieu of yearly average exchange rates must determine historic rates under paragraphs (c)(3)(i)(A) and (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section using the spot rate (as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) for the date an asset is acquired by a section 987 QBU or a liability is assumed or incurred by a section 987 QBU in lieu of using the yearly average exchange rate.

(iii) *Date placed in service for depreciable or amortizable property.* In the case of depreciable or amortizable property, an owner may determine the historic rate (whether a yearly average exchange rate or a spot rate, as applicable) by reference to the date such property is placed in service by the section 987 QBU rather than the date the property was acquired, provided that this convention is consistently applied for all such property attributable to that section 987 QBU.

(iv) *Changed functional currency.* In the case of a section 987 QBU or an owner of a section 987 QBU that previously changed its functional currency, § 1.985-5(d)(1)(ii)(A) and § 1.985-5(e)(4)(i)(A), respectively, shall be taken into account in determining the historic rate for an item reflected on the balance sheet of the section 987 QBU immediately prior to the year of change.

(d) *Marked item.* A marked item is an asset (marked asset) or liability (marked liability) that is properly reflected on the books and records of a section 987 QBU under § 1.987-2(b) and that -

(1) Is denominated in, or determined by reference to, the functional currency of the section 987 QBU, is not a section 988 transaction of the section 987 QBU, and would be a section 988 transaction if such item were held or entered into directly by the owner of the section 987 QBU;

(2) Is a prepaid expense or a liability for an advance payment of unearned income, in either case having an original term of one year or less on the date the prepaid expense or liability for an advance payment of unearned income arises; or

(3) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.987-1T(d)(3).

(e) *Historic item.* A historic item is an asset (historic asset) or liability (historic liability) that is properly reflected on the books and records of a section 987 QBU under § 1.987-2(b) and that is not a marked item (as defined in paragraph (d) of this section).

(f) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.987-1T(f).

(g) *Elections* - (1) *In general.* This paragraph (g) provides rules for making elections under section 987. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, such elections -

(i) May be made separately for each section 987 QBU;

(ii) Are made by the owner of the section 987 QBU (as defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section); and

(iii) Must be made for the first taxable year in which the election is relevant in determining the section 987 taxable income or loss, or section 987 gain or loss, of the section 987 QBU and in which the regulations implementing the election are applicable with respect to the section 987 QBU.

(2) *Exceptions to the general rules* - (i) *Consistency and timeliness requirements for certain elections.* Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, the following consistency and timeliness requirements apply:

(A) *Section 987 grouping election.* Elections made pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section (regarding the grouping of section 987 QBUs) are binding on all section 987 QBUs that are eligible to be grouped under the particular election (for example, election to group all euro QBUs owned by the same aggregate partnership), regardless of whether the section 987 QBU is established or acquired after the election is made and regardless of whether the section 987 QBU is identified on the election as required in paragraph (g)(3)(i)(A) of this section.

(B) through (C) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.987-1T(g)(2)(i)(B) through (C).

(ii) *Persons making elections for QBUs owned by foreign corporations.* Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, if a section 987 QBU is owned by a foreign corporation, elections shall be made in accordance with § 1.964-1(c) by the foreign corporation's controlling domestic shareholders, as defined under § 1.964-1(c)(5)(i) (dealing with controlled foreign corporations) and § 1.964-1(c)(5)(ii) (dealing with noncontrolled section 902 corporations).

(3) *Manner of making elections* - (i) *Election made by attaching statement to a return.* Except as provided in paragraph (g)(3)(ii) of this section, elections shall be made under section 987 for each section 987 QBU by attaching a statement with the information required in this paragraph (g)(3)(i) to the timely filed tax return of the owner or, in the case of a foreign corporation, other applicable person for the first taxable year in which the election is required to be made under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section.

(A) *Section 987 grouping election.* The election provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section must be titled “Section 987 Grouping Election Under § 1.987-1(b)(2)(ii)” and provide the following information:

(*1*) The name, address, and functional currency of each section 987 QBU that the taxpayer is grouping together; and

(*2*) The owner's name and address.

(B) *Election to use a spot rate convention.* An election under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section to use a spot rate convention must be titled “Section 987 Election to Use a Spot Rate Convention Under § 1.987-1(c)(1)(ii)” and provide the following information:

(*1*) A description of the convention; and

(*2*) The name and address of each section 987 QBU for which the election is being made.

(C) *Election to use spot rates in lieu of yearly average exchange rates.* An election under paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section to use spot rates in lieu of yearly average exchange rates must be titled “Section 987 Election to Use Spot Rates in Lieu of Yearly Average Exchange Rates Under § 1.987-1(c)(1)(iii)” and provide the following information:

(D) *Election to use the historic inventory method.* An election under § 1.987-3(c)(2)(iv)(B) to use the historic inventory method shall be titled “Section 987 Election to Use the Historic Inventory Method Under § 1.987-3(c)(2)(iv)(B)” and must provide the name and address of each section 987 QBU for which the election is being made.

(E) through (H) [Reserved]. For further guidance, see § 1.987-1T(g)(3)(i)(E) through (H).

(ii) *Election made by filing a dedicated section 987 form.* If the Commissioner publishes a form that provides the manner in which elections are made under section 987, the form shall govern the manner in which elections are made under section 987.

(4) *No change in method of accounting.* An election under section 987 is not governed by the general rules concerning changes in methods of accounting. See also paragraph (g)(5) of this section.

(5) *Revocation of an election.* Elections under section 987 may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner or his delegate. The Commissioner or his delegate will consider allowing a revocation of an election if the taxpayer can demonstrate significantly changed circumstances or such other circumstances that clearly demonstrate a substantial non-tax business reason for revoking the election.

[T.D. 9794, 81 FR 88821, Dec. 8, 2016, as amended by T.D. 9795, 81 FR 88867, Dec. 8, 2016]
