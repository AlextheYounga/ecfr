##### ยง 1.382-5 Section 382 limitation. #####

(a) *Scope.* Following an ownership change, the section 382 limitation for any post-change year is an amount equal to the value of the loss corporation multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate that applies with respect to the ownership change, and adjusted as required by section 382 and the regulations thereunder. See, for example, section 382(b)(2) (relating to the carryforward of unused section 382 limitation), section 382(b)(3)(B) (relating to the section 382 limitation for the post-change year that includes the change date), section 382(m)(2) (relating to short taxable years), and section 382(h) (relating to recognized built-in gains and section 338 gains).

(b) *Computation of value.* [Reserved]

(c) *Short taxable year.* The section 382 limitation for any post-change year that is less than 365 days is the amount that bears the same ratio to the section 382 limitation determined under section 382(b)(1) as the number of days in the post-change year bears to 365. The section 382 limitation, as so determined, is adjusted as required by section 382 and the regulations thereunder. This paragraph (c) does not apply to a 52-53 week taxable year that is less than 365 days unless a return is required under section 443 (relating to short periods) for such year.

(d) *Successive ownership changes and absorption of a section 382 limitation* - (1) *In general.* If a loss corporation has two (or more) ownership changes, any losses attributable to the period preceding the earlier ownership change are treated as pre-change losses with respect to both ownership changes. Thus, the later ownership change may result in a lesser (but never in a greater) section 382 limitation with respect to such losses. In any case, the amount of taxable income for any post-change year that can be offset by pre-change losses may not exceed the section 382 limitation for such ownership change, reduced by the amount of taxable income offset by pre-change losses subject to any earlier ownership change(s).

(2) *Recognized built-in gains and losses.* [Reserved]

(3) *Effective date.* This paragraph (d) applies to taxable years of a loss corporation beginning on or after January 1, 1997.

(e) *Controlled groups.* See ยง 1.382-8 for rules for determining the value of a loss corporation that is a member of a controlled group.

(f) *Effective date.* Except as otherwise provided, this section applies to a loss corporation that has an ownership change to which section 382(a), as amended by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, applies.
