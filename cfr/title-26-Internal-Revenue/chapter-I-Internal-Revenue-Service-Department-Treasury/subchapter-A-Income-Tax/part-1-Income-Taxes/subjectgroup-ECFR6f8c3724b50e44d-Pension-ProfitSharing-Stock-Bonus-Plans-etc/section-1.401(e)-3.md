##### § 1.401(e)-3 Requirements for qualification of trusts and plans benefiting owner-employees. #####

(a) *“Keogh” or “H.R. 10” plans covering owner-employees; introduction and organization of regulations.* This section prescribes the additional requirements which must be met for qualification of a trust forming part of a pension or profit-sharing plan, or of an annuity plan, which covers any self-employed individual who is an owner-employee as defined in section 401(c)(3). These additional requirements are prescribed in section 401(d) and are made applicable to such a trust by section 401(a)(10)(B) and to an annuity plan by section 404(a)(2). However, to the extent that the provisions of §§ 1.401(e)-1 and 1.401(e)-2 are not modified by the provisions of this section such provisions are also applicable to a plan which covers an owner-employee. The provisions of this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, unless otherwise specified.

(b) [Reserved]
