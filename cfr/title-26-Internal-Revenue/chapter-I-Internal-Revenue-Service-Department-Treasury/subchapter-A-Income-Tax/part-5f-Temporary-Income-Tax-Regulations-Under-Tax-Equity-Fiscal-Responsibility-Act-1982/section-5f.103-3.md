(2) The date of issue (as defined in paragraph (g)(1)),

The information to be supplied must be determined based on information and reasonable expectations as of the date of issue. Therefore, such statement need not be amended to report information learned subsequent to the date of issue. However, if the statement is filed after the date of issue it may reflect such information and the reasonable expectations of the issuer as of that date.

(d) *Additional information.* An issuer may supply the following information -

(1) The average maturity of the issue (as defined in section 103(b)(14)), and

(2) The average reasonably expected economic life (as defined in section 103(b)(14)) of the facility which is financed with the issue.

(e) *Time for filing.* The statement required by section 103(l) and this section shall be filed not later than the 15th day of the 2nd calendar month after the close of the calendar quarter in which the obligation is issued. It may be filed at any time before such date but must be complete based on facts and reasonable expectations as of the date of issue. The Secretary may grant an extension of time for filing the statement required under section 103(l) and this section if there is reasonable cause for the failure to file such statement in a timely fashion.

(1) The term *date of issue* means the date on which the issuer physically exchanges the first of the obligations which are part of the issue for the underwriter's (or other purchaser's) funds. In the event that amounts are periodically advanced with respect to an issue, the date of issue is when the first of such obligations under the issue is created and the funds are advanced.

(2) The term *maturity* means those obligations of the issue having both the same maturity date and the same stated interest rate.

(3) The term *term of an issue* means the duration of the period beginning on the date of issue and ending on the latest maturity date of any obligation of the issue without regard to optional redemption dates.

(4) The term *lendable proceeds* means the amount of the original proceeds, net of amounts allocated to a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund. See generally § 1.103-13(b) and § 1.103-14(d) for further definitions.

(5) The term *initial principal user* means each person who as of the date of issue is obligated to use the facility to such an extent that under section 103(b)(6) such person would be treated as a principal user. With respect to organizations described in section 501(c)(3), however, such determination is made without regard to whether such organization is treated as an exempt organization under section 103(b)(3) and § 1.103-7(b)(2).
