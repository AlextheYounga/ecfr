Such demonstration must be made by a written application to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: E:EP, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20224. Such application must meet the requirements set forth in paragraphs (c) to (g) of this section.

(c) *Fiduciary ability.* The applicant must demonstrate in detail his ability to act within the accepted rules of fiduciary conduct. Such demonstration must include the following elements of proof:

(1) *Continuity.* (i) The applicant must assure the uninterrupted performance of its fiduciary duties notwithstanding the death or change of its owners. Thus, for example, there must be sufficient diversity in the ownership of the applicant to ensure that the death or change of its owners will not interrupt the conduct of its business. Therefore, the applicant cannot be an individual.

(ii) Sufficient diversity in the ownership of an incorporated applicant means that individuals each of whom owns more than 20 percent of the voting stock in the applicant own, in the aggregate, no more than 50 percent of such stock.

(iii) Sufficient diversity in the ownership of an applicant which is a partnership means that -

(A) Individuals each of whom owns more than 20 percent of the profits interest in the partnership own, in the aggregate, no more than 50 percent of such profits interest, and

For this purpose, the rules for constructive ownership of stock provided in section 1563(e) and (f)(2). For this purpose, the rules for constructive ownership of stock provided in section 1563(e) and (f)(2) shall apply to a capital or profits interest in a partnership as if it were a stock interest.

(2) *Established location.* The applicant must have an established place of business in the United States where he is accessible during every business day.

(3) *Fiduciary experience.* The applicant must have fiduciary experience or expertise sufficient to ensure that he will be able to perform his fiduciary duties. Evidence of fiduciary experience must include proof that a significant part of the business of the applicant consists of exercising fiduciary powers similar to those he will exercise if his application is approved. Evidence of fiduciary expertise must include proof that the applicant employs personnel experienced in the administration of fiduciary powers similar to those he will exercise if his application is approved.

(f) *Rules of fiduciary conduct* - (1) *Administration of fiduciary powers.* The applicant must demonstrate that under applicable regulatory requirements, corporate or other governing instruments, or its established operating procedures:

(i)(A) The owners or directors of the applicant will be responsible for the proper exercise of fiduciary powers by the applicant. Thus, all matters pertinent thereto, including the determination of policies, the investment and disposition of property held in a fiduciary capacity, and the direction and review of the actions of all employees utilized by the applicant in the exercise of his fiduciary powers, will be the responsibility of the owners or directors. In discharging this responsibility, the owners or directors may assign to designated employees, by action duly recorded, the administration of such of the applicant's fiduciary powers as may be proper to assign.

(B) A written record will be made of the acceptance and of the relinquishment or closing out of all fiduciary accounts, and of the assets held for each account.

(iii) The applicant will designate, employ, or retain legal counsel who will be readily available to pass upon fiduciary matters and to advise the applicant.

(iv) In order to segregate the performance of his fiduciary duties from other business activities, the applicant will maintain a separate trust division under the immediate supervision of an individual designated for that purpose.

(2) *Adequacy of net worth.* (i) Not less frequently than once during each calendar year the applicant will determine the value of the assets held by him in trust. Such assets will be valued at their current value, except that the assets of an employee benefit plan to which section 103(b)(3)(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1023(b)(3)(A)) applies will be considered to have the value stated in the most recent annual report of the plan.

(ii) No fiduciary account will be accepted by the applicant unless his net worth (determined as of the end of the most recent taxable year) exceeds the greater of -

(A) $100,000, or

(B) Four percent of the value of all of the assets held by the applicant in trust (determined as of the most recent valuation date).

(iii) The applicant will take whatever lawful steps are necessary (including the relinquishment of fiduciary accounts) to ensure that his net worth (determined as of the close of each taxable year) exceeds the greater of -

Such audits shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and shall involve such tests of the fiduciary books and records of the applicant as are considered necessary by the independent qualified public accountant.

(ii) In the case of an applicant who is regulated, supervised, and subject to periodic examination by a State or Federal agency, such applicant may adopt an adequate continuous audit system in lieu of the periodic audits required by paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section.

(iii) A report of the audits and examinations required under this subparagraph, together with the action taken thereon, will be noted in the fiduciary records of the applicant.

(4) *Funds awaiting investment or distribution.* Funds held in a fiduciary capacity by the applicant awaiting investment or distribution will not be held uninvested or undistributed any longer than is reasonable for the proper management of the account.

(5) *Custody of investments.* (i) Except for investments pooled in a common investment fund in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f)(6) of this section, the investments of each account will not be commingled with any other property.

(ii) Fiduciary assets requiring safekeeping will be deposited in an adequate vault. A permanent record will be kept of fiduciary assets deposited in or withdrawn from the vault.

(6) *Common investment funds.* Where not in contravention of local law the assets of an account may be pooled in a common investment fund (as defined in paragraph (f)(8)(iii) of this section) which must be administered as follows:

(i) Each common investment fund must be established and maintained in accordance with a written agreement, containing appropriate provisions as to the manner in which the fund is to be operated, including provisions relating to the investment powers and a general statement of the investment policy of the applicant with respect to the fund; the allocation of income, profits and losses; the terms and conditions governing the admission or withdrawal of participations in the fund; the auditing of accounts of the applicant with respect to the fund; the basis and method of valuing assets in the fund, setting forth specific criteria for each type of asset; the minimum frequency for valuation of assets of the fund; the period following each such valuation date during which the valuation may be made (which period in usual circumstances may not exceed 10 business days); the basis upon which the fund may be terminated; and such other matters as may be necessary to define clearly the rights of participants in the fund. A copy of the agreement must be available at the principal office of the applicant for inspection during all business hours, and upon request a copy of the agreement must be furnished to any interested person.

(ii) All participations in the common investment fund must be on the basis of a proportionate interest in all of the assets.

(iii) Not less frequently than once during each period of 3 months applicant must determine the value of the assets in the fund as of the date set for the valuation of assets. No participation may be admitted to or withdrawn from the fund except (A) on the basis of such valuation and (B) as of such valuation date. No participation may be admitted to or withdrawn from the fund unless a written request for or notice of intention of taking such action has been entered on or before the valuation date in the fiduciary records of the applicant. No request or notice may be canceled or countermanded after the valuation date.

(iv)(A) The applicant must at least once during each period of 12 months cause an adequate audit to be made of the common investment fund by a qualified public accountant.

(B) The applicant must at least once during each period of 12 months prepare a financial report of the fund which, based upon the above audit, must contain a list of investments in the fund showing the cost and current market value of each investment; a statement for the period since the previous report showing purchases, with cost; sales, with profit or loss and any other investment changes; income and disbursements; and an appropriate notation as to any investments in default.

(C) The applicant must transmit and certify the accuracy of the financial report to the administrator of each plan participating in the common investment fund within 120 days after the end of the plan year.

(v) When participations are withdrawn from a common investment fund, distributions may be made in cash or ratably in kind, or partly in cash and partly in kind, provided that all distributions as of any one valuation date must be made on the same basis.

(vi) If for any reason an investment is withdrawn in kind from a common investment fund for the benefit of all participants in the fund at the time of such withdrawal and such investment is not distributed ratably in kind, it must be segregated and administered or realized upon for the benefit ratably of all participants in the common investment fund at the time of withdrawal.

(7) *Books and records.* (i) The applicant must keep his fiduciary records separate and distinct from other records. All fiduciary records must be so kept and retained for as long as the contents thereof may become material in the administration of any internal revenue law. The fiduciary records must contain full information relative to each account.

Such notification must be addressed to Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Attention: E:EP, Internal Revenue Service, Washington, DC 20224.

(5) *Substitution of trustee.* No applicant shall be approved unless he undertakes to act as trustee only under trust instruments which contain a provision to the effect that the employer is to substitute another trustee upon notification by the Commissioner that such substitution is required because the applicant has failed to comply with the requirements of this section or is not keeping such records, or making such returns, or rendering such statements as are required by forms or regulations.
