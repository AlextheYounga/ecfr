Thus, for example, there must be sufficient diversity in the ownership of the applicant to ensure that the death or change of its owners will not interrupt the conduct of its business.

(i)(A) The owners or directors of the applicant will be responsible for the proper exercise of fiduciary powers by the applicant. Thus, all matters pertinent thereto, including the determination of policies, the investment and disposition of property held in a fiduciary capacity, and the direction and review of the actions of all employees utilized by the applicant in the exercise of his fiduciary powers, will be the responsibility of the owners or directors. In discharging this responsibility, the owners or directors may assign to designated employees, by action duly recorded, the administration of such of the applicant's fiduciary powers as may be proper to assign.

(2) *Adequacy of net worth.* (i) Not less frequently than once during each calendar year the applicant will determine the value of the assets held by him in trust. Such assets will be valued at their current value, except that the assets of an employee benefit plan to which section 103(b)(3)(A) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1023(b)(3)(A)) applies will be considered to have the value stated in the most recent annual report of the plan.

(A) $100,000, or

(B) Four percent of the value of all of the assets held by the applicant in trust (determined as of the most recent valuation date).

(4) *Funds awaiting investment or distribution.* Funds held in a fiduciary capacity by the applicant awaiting investment or distribution will not be held uninvested or undistributed any longer than is reasonable for the proper management of the account.

(5) *Custody of investments.* (i) Except for investments pooled in a common investment fund in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f)(6) of this section, the investments of each account will not be commingled with any other property.

(ii) Fiduciary assets requiring safekeeping will be deposited in an adequate vault. A permanent record will be kept of fiduciary assets deposited in or withdrawn from the vault.

(6) *Common investment funds.* Where not in contravention of local law the assets of an account may be pooled in a common investment fund (as defined in paragraph (f)(8)(iii) of this section) which must be administered as follows:

(i) Each common investment fund must be established and maintained in accordance with a written agreement, containing appropriate provisions as to the manner in which the fund is to be operated, including provisions relating to the investment powers and a general statement of the investment policy of the applicant with respect to the fund; the allocation of income, profits and losses; the terms and conditions governing the admission or withdrawal of participations in the fund; the auditing of accounts of the applicant with respect to the fund; the basis and method of valuing assets in the fund, setting forth specific criteria for each type of asset; the minimum frequency for valuation of assets of the fund; the period following each such valuation date during which the valuation may be made (which period in usual circumstances may not exceed 10 business days); the basis upon which the fund may be terminated; and such other matters as may be necessary to define clearly the rights of participants in the fund. A copy of the agreement must be available at the principal office of the applicant for inspection during all business hours, and upon request a copy of the agreement must be furnished to any interested person.

(ii) All participations in the common investment fund must be on the basis of a proportionate interest in all of the assets.

(iii) Not less frequently than once during each period of 3 months applicant must determine the value of the assets in the fund as of the date set for the valuation of assets. No participation may be admitted to or withdrawn from the fund except (A) on the basis of such valuation and (B) as of such valuation date.

No request or notice may be canceled or countermanded after the valuation date.

(v) When participations are withdrawn from a common investment fund, distributions may be made in cash or ratably in kind, or partly in cash and partly in kind, provided that all distributions as of any one valuation date must be made on the same basis.

(vi) If for any reason an investment is withdrawn in kind from a common investment fund for the benefit of all participants in the fund at the time of such withdrawal and such investment is not distributed ratably in kind, it must be segregated and administered or realized upon for the benefit ratably of all participants in the common investment fund at the time of withdrawal.
