The return must be filed by the grantor or the transferor, or the fiduciary of the estate in the case of a testamentary trust. The return must be filed whether or not any beneficiary is a United States person and whether or not the grantor or any other person may be treated as the substantial owner of any portion of the trust under sections 671-678.

(b) *Meaning of terms.* For purposes of this section the following terms shall have the meaning assigned to them in this paragraph:

(4) *Transferor.* The term “transferor” refers to any United States person, other than a person who is the grantor or the fiduciary (as defined in subparagraph (5) of this paragraph), who transfers money or property to or for the benefit of a foreign trust. It does not refer to a person who transfers money or property to a foreign trust pursuant to a sale or an exchange which is made for full and adequate consideration.

(5) *Fiduciary of an estate.* In the case of a testamentary trust expressed in the will of a decedent the term “fiduciary of an estate” refers to the executor or administrator who is responsible for establishing a foreign trust on behalf of the decedent.

(1) The name, address, and identifying number of the person (or persons) filing the return, a statement identifying each person named as either a grantor, fiduciary of an estate, or transferor, and the date of the transaction for which the return is being filed;

(10) A detailed list of the property transferred to the foreign trust in the transaction for which the return is being filed, containing a complete description of each item transferred, its adjusted basis and its fair market value on the date transferred, and the consideration, if any, paid by the foreign trust for such transfer; and

(11) The name and address of the person (or persons) having custody of the books of account and records of the foreign trust, and the location of such books and records if different from such address.

(d) *Special provisions* - (1) *Separate return for each foreign trust and each transfer.* If a United States person creates more than one foreign trust or transfers money or property to more than one foreign trust, then separate returns must be filed with respect to each foreign trust where returns are required under section 6048 and this section.

However, where more than one transfer to the same foreign trust is made by a United States person during any 90-day period, such person may, at his election, file a single return, so long as the return includes the information required with respect to each transfer and is filed on or before the 90th day after the earliest transfer in any such period.

(2) *Joint returns.* Where returns are required under section 6048 and this section by two or more persons who either jointly create a foreign trust or jointly transfer money or property to a foreign trust, they may jointly execute and file one return in lieu of filing several returns.

(3) *Actual ownership of money or property transferred.* If any person referred to in this section is not the real party in interest as to the money or property transferred but is merely acting for a United States person, the information required under this section shall be furnished in the name of and by the actual owner of such money or property, except that a fiduciary of an estate shall file information relating to the decedent.

(4) *Payments to an employees' trust, etc.* In the case of contributions made to a foreign trust under a plan which provides pension, profit-sharing, stock bonus, sickness, accident, unemployment, welfare, or similar benefits or a combination of such benefits for employees, neither employers nor employees shall be required to file a return as set forth in this section.

(e) *Time and place for filing return* - (1) *Time for filing.* Any return required by section 6048 and this section shall be filed on or before the 90th day after either the creation of any foreign trust by a United States person or the transfer of any money or property to a foreign trust by a United States person.
