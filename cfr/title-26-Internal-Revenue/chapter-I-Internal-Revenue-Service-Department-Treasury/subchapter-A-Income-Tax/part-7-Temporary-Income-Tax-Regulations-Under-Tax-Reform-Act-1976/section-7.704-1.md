##### ยง 7.704-1 Partner's distributive share. #####

(a)-(c) [Reserved]

(d) *Limitation on allowance of losses.* (1)-(2) [Reserved]

(3)(i) Section 213(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1976 amended section 704(d) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the deductions by partners of losses incurred by a partnership. A partner is entitled to deduct the share of partnership loss to the extent of the adjusted basis of the partner's interest in the partnership. As amended, section 704(d) provides, in general, that the adjusted basis of a partner's interest in the partnership for the purpose of deducting partnership losses shall not include any portion of a partnership liability for which the partner has no personal liability. This restriction, however, does not apply to any activity to the extent that section 465 of the Code applies nor to any partnership whose principal activity is investing in real property, other than mineral property. Section 465 does not apply to corporations other than a subchapter S corporation or a personal holding company.

(ii) The restrictions in the amendment to section 704(d) will not apply to any corporate partner with respect to liabilities incurred in an activity described in section 465(c)(1). In all other respects the restrictions in the amendment will apply to all corporate partners unless the partnership's principal activity is investment in real property, other than mineral property.
