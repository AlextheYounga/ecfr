##### ยง 1516.7 How can I appeal CEQ's decision to deny my request to access or correct records about me? #####

(a) If CEQ denies your request to access or correct CEQ's records about you, you can appeal the decision using the same procedures you would use to make a request for access to your records under ยง 1516.4.

(b) In your appeal, you must include a copy of CEQ's decision denying your request and explain exactly why you believe the decision was wrong.

(c) The General Counsel of CEQ (or the General Counsel's designee) will review your appeal, decide whether to grant or deny it, and inform you of the decision within 30 working days. If it is necessary to extend the time for making a decision, the Chair of CEQ (or the Chair's designee) will explain why in writing.

(d) If CEQ's General Counsel (or designee) denies your appeal, you may provide CEQ with a concise statement that explains your disagreement with the decision, and you may bring a civil lawsuit against CEQ.

(1) If CEQ subsequently discloses the disputed record under ยง 1516.4, we will clearly identify the disputed portion of the record and attach a copy of your statement of disagreement.

(2) For more information about filing a civil lawsuit, see 5 U.S.C. 552a(g)(1).
