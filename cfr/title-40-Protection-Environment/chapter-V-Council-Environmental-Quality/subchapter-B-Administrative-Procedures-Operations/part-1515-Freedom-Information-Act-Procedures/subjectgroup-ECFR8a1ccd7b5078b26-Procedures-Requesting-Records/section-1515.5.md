##### § 1515.5 Who can help me with my FOIA request to CEQ? #####

(a) You may contact CEQ's FOIA Public Liaison for assistance with your FOIA request, including help in formulating your request and information about the status of your request, or to submit concerns about CEQ's handling of your request. You can contact CEQ's FOIA Public Liaison by email at *efoia@ceq.eop.gov* or by phone at 202-395-5750. For additional contact information, visit *https://www.foia.gov* and choose “Council on Environmental Quality” in the index of Government agencies.

(b) If you have a dispute with CEQ over its handling of your FOIA request, you may contact the National Archives and Records Administration's Office of Government Information Services for assistance or dispute resolution services by calling (202) 741-5770 or visiting *https://archives.gov/ogis.* If CEQ agrees to participate in the voluntary dispute resolution services provided by the Office of Government Information Services, CEQ will actively engage as a partner to the process in an attempt to resolve the dispute.

(c) If you are an individual with a disability, CEQ will provide you with access to and use of information and data through its FOIA program that is comparable to the access to and use of the information and data by members of the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless doing so would impose an undue burden on CEQ.

(d) If your proficiency in English is limited, CEQ will take steps as appropriate to provide you with meaningful access to CEQ's FOIA program.
