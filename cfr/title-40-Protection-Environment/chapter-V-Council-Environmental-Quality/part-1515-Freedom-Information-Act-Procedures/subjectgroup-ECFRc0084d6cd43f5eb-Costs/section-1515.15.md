##### ยง 1515.15 How will CEQ process my request? #####

(a) If your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek; the information you have requested is not a record subject to FOIA; CEQ has already published the information you are requesting; or your request does not follow the procedures described in the regulations in this part, we will deny your request in accordance with ยง 1515.19.

(b) If your request reasonably describes the records you seek and otherwise comports with the procedures described in this part, CEQ will process your request as follows:

(1) CEQ will acknowledge your request in writing and assign it an individualized tracking number. The written acknowledgment may include CEQ's estimate of the date on which we will respond to your request.

(2) CEQ will search for agency records that respond to your request. CEQ ordinarily will search records in our possession as of the date that we begin our search. We will notify you if we use a different date.

(3) If CEQ finds records that you have requested, we will determine whether to grant your request (*i.e.,* provide you with the records you have requested) or to deny it (*i.e.,* withhold the relevant records from disclosure in accordance with ยง 1515.16).

(4) Once CEQ has determined whether to grant your request in full, grant it in part and deny it in part, or deny it in full, we will notify you of our determination in writing.

(c) If CEQ determines that it has a voluminous amount of records responsive to your request, or if your request requires CEQ to search for records in multiple locations (electronic or physical), CEQ may provide you with one or more interim responses, releasing responsive records to you on a rolling basis.
