##### ยง 1515.14 What if my request is urgent? #####

(a) You may ask CEQ to expedite the processing of your FOIA request or appeal. If CEQ agrees to expedite processing of your request or appeal, we will process it with priority over non-expedited requests and appeals and respond to you as quickly as possible.

(b) CEQ will expedite requests or appeals if:

(1) Failing to expedite the request or appeal could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or

(2) You are primarily engaged in disseminating information (*e.g.,* you are a member of the news media), and you have an urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, beyond the public's right to know about Government activity generally.

(c) You may ask for expedited processing when you make your initial request or appeal, or at any later time.

(d) In order to ask for expedited processing, you must submit a statement, certified to be true and correct, that explains in detail why your request or appeal satisfies the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. If you believe that you have an urgent need to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity, you should provide examples of other coverage of the same or related subjects, if possible. CEQ may waive the formal certification requirement at its discretion.

(e) CEQ will notify you within 10 calendar days whether we will grant or deny you expedited processing.

(f) If CEQ denies you expedited processing, you may appeal that determination using the procedures in subpart C of this part. We will process your appeal as promptly as we can.
