##### ยง 1516.4 How can I obtain access to CEQ's records about me? #####

(a) You can obtain access to CEQ's records about you by submitting a request by email to *efoia@ceq.eop.gov.* If you are not able to make your request by email, please contact CEQ's Office of the General Counsel for assistance by calling 202-395-5750.

(b) Your request must describe the records that you want, in enough detail to enable CEQ to locate them with a reasonable amount of effort.

(1) You should name or describe the system of records you want CEQ to search.

(2) If you are not sure which system of records you are interested in, you may request that CEQ inform you which of its systems of records, if any, contain records about you.

(c) To protect the privacy of your records, CEQ will require you to verify your identity before processing your request. CEQ may require you to:

(1) Provide a statement that contains your name, your current address, and your date and place of birth, and sign the statement before a notary public;

(2) Verify your identity using an electronic authentication process; or

(3) Supply additional information as necessary in order to verify your identity.

(d) CEQ may deny your request if:

(1) CEQ prepared the records you are seeking in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding (that is, a lawsuit or a similar proceeding); or

(2) The Privacy Act exempts the system containing your records from the requirement that CEQ provide those records upon request.

(e) If CEQ grants your request, you may arrange to review your records in person, obtain a copy from CEQ, or both. If you choose to review your records in person, you may choose one person to accompany you, except that CEQ may first require you to authorize CEQ to discuss your records in that person's presence.

(f) If CEQ denies your request in whole or in part, CEQ will give you the reason for its decision in writing and explain how you can challenge the denial.
