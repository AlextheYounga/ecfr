##### § 424.23 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable. #####

The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable:

*Provided, however,* That for nonelectric furnace smelting processes, the units of effluent limitations set forth in this section shall be read as “kg/kkg of product” rather than “kg/Mwh,” and the limitations (except for pH) shall be 3.3 times those listed in the table in this section (or, for English units, “lb/ton of product” rather than “lb/Mwh,” and the limitations (except for pH) shall be three times those listed in the table).[44 FR 50744, Aug. 29, 1979]
