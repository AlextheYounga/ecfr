##### § 424.22 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

*Provided, however,* That for nonelectric furnace smelting processes, the units of effluent limitations set forth in this section shall be read as “kg/kkg of product” rather than “kg/Mwh,” and the limitations (except for pH) shall be 3.3 times those listed in the table in this section (or, for English units, “lb/ton of product” rather than “lb/Mwh,” and the limitations (except for pH) shall be three times those listed in the table).[39 FR 6809, Feb. 22, 1974, as amended at 39 FR 17841, May 21, 1974; 60 FR 33957, June 29, 1995]
