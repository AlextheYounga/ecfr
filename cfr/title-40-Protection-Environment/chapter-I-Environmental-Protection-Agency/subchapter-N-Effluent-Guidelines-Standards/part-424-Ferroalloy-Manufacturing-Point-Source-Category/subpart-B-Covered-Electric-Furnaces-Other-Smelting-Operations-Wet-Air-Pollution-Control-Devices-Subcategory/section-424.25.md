##### § 424.25 Standards of performance for new sources. #####

The following standards of performance establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart:

*Provided, however,* That for nonelectric furnace smelting processes, the units of effluent limitations set forth in this section shall be read as “kg/kkg of product” rather than “kg/Mwh,” and the limitations (except for pH) shall be 3.3 times those listed in the table in this section (or, for English units, “lb/ton of product” rather than “lb/Mwh,” and the limitations (except for pH) shall be three times those listed in the table).[39 FR 6809, Feb. 22, 1974, as amended at 39 FR 17841, May 21, 1974]
