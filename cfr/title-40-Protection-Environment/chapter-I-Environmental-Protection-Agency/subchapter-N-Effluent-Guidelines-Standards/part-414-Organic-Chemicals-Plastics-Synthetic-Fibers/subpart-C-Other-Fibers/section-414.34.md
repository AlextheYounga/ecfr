##### ยง 414.34 New source performance standards (NSPS). #####

(a) Any new source that uses end-of-pipe biological treatment and is subject to this subpart must achieve discharges in accordance with ยง 414.91 of this part, and also must not exceed the quantity (mass) determined by multiplying the process wastewater flow subject to this subpart times the concentrations in the following table.

(b) Any new source that does not use end-of-pipe biological treatment and is subject to this subpart must achieve discharges in accordance with ยง 414.101 of this part, and also must not exceed the quantity (mass) determined by multiplying the process wastewater flow subject to this subpart times the concentrations in the following table.
