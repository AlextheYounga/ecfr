##### § 413.84 Pretreatment standards for existing sources. #####

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES):

(a) No user introducing wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works under the provisions of this subpart shall augment the use of process wastewater or otherwise dilute the wastewater as a partial or total substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with this standard.

(b) For a source discharging less than 38,000 liters (10,000 gal) per calendar day of electroplating process wastewater the following limitations shall apply:

|Pollutant or pollutant property|Maximum for any 1 day|Average of daily values for 4 consecutive monitoring days shall not exceed|

(e) For wastewater sources regulated under paragraph (c) of this section, the following optional control program may be elected by the source introducing treated process wastewater into a publicly owned treatment works with the concurrence of the control authority. These optional pollutant parameters are not eligible for allowance for removal achieved by the publicly owned treatment works under 40 CFR 403.7. In the absence of strong chelating agents, after reduction of hexavalent chromium wastes, and after neutralization using calcium oxide (or hydroxide) the following limitations shall apply:
