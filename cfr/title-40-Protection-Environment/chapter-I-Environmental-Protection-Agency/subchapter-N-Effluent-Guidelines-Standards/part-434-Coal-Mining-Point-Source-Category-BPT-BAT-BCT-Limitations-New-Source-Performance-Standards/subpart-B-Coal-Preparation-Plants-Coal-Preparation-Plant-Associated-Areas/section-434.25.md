##### § 434.25 New source performance standards (NSPS). #####

The following new source performance standards (NSPS) shall be achieved by any new source coal preparation plant and coal preparation plant associated areas, as indicated:

(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 401.17 and §§ 434.61, 434.62 and 434.63 of this part, the following new source performance standards shall apply to discharges from new source coal preparation plants and new source coal preparation plant associated areas, if such discharges normally exhibit a pH of less than 6.0 prior to treatment:

| Pollutant or pollutant property  |Maximum for any 1 day|Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|
|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|           Iron, total            |         6.0         |                      3.0                      |
|         Manganese, total         |         4.0         |                      2.0                      |
|               TSS                |         70          |                      35                       |
|                pH                |   (<sup>1</sup>)    |                (<sup>1</sup>)                 |
|<sup>1</sup> 6.0-9.0 at all times.|                     |                                               |

(b) Except as provided in 40 CFR 401.17 and §§ 434.61, 434.62 and 434.63 of this part, the following new source performance standards shall apply to discharges from new source coal preparation plants and new source coal preparation plant associated areas, if such discharges normally exhibit a pH equal to or greater than 6.0 prior to treatment:

| Pollutant or pollutant property  |Maximum for any 1 day|Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|
|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|           Iron, total            |         6.0         |                      3.0                      |
