##### § 434.55 New source performance standards (NSPS). #####

The following new source performance standards shall apply to the post-mining areas of all new source coal mines:

(a) *Reclamation areas.* The standards of this subsection apply to discharges from reclamation areas at new source coal mines until SMCRA bond release.

Except as provided in 40 CFR 401.17 and §§ 434.61 and 434.63 (d)(2) of this part, the following new source performance standards shall be achieved for a discharge subject to the provisions of this subsection:

|            Pollutant or pollutant property             |            Limitations             |
|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
|                   Settleable Solids                    |0.5 ml/1 maximum not to be exceeded.|
|                           pH                           |           (<sup>1</sup>)           |
|(<sup>1</sup>) Within the range 6.0 to 9.0 at all times.|                                    |

(b) *Underground mine drainage.* The standards in this subsection apply to discharges from the underground workings of new source underground mines until bond release.

(1) Except as provided in 40 CFR 401.17 and §§ 434.61, 434.62, and 434.63 of this part, the following new source performance standards shall be achieved for the discharge of any acid or ferruginous mine drainage subject to this subsection:

|           Pollutant or pollutant property            |Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|

(2) Except as provided in 40 CFR 401.17 and §§ 434.61 and 434.63 of this part, the following new source performance standards shall be achieved for the discharge of any alkaline mine drainage subject to this subsection:

|           Pollutant or pollutant property            |Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
