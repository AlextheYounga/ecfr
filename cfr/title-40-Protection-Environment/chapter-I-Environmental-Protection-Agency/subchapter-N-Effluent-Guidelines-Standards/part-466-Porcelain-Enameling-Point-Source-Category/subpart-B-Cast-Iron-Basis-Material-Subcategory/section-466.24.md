(b) In cases when POTW find it necessary to impose mass pretreatment standards the following equivalent mass standards are provided.

(1) There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants from metal preparation operations.

(2) The discharge of process watewater pollutants from all porcelain enameling costing operations shall not exceed the values set forth below:

|Pollutant or pollutant property|                                     Maximum for any 1 day                                     |Maximum for monthly average|    |      |
