(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources.

|Pollutant or pollutant property|   Maximum for any 1 day   |Maximum for monthly average|
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|                               |Milligrams per liter (mg/l)|                           |

(b) In cases where POTW find it necessary to impose mass pretreatment standards the following equivalent mass standards are provided:

|Pollutant or pollutant property|                            Maximum for any 1 day                            |Maximum for monthly average|                 |    |
