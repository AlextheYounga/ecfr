(b) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, and attributable to lead-sheathed hose production, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best practicable control technology currently available, in addition to the limitations set forth by § 428.52(a):

|Effluent characteristic|                      Effluent limitations                       |      |
