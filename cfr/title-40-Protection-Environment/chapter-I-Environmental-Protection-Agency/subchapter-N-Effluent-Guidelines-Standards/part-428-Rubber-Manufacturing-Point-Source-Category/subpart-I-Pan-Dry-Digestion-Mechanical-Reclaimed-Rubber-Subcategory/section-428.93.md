##### § 428.93 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable. #####

(a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable:

(b) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, and attributable to pan, dry digestion, and mechanical reclaimed rubber processes which are integrated with a wet digestion reclaimed rubber process, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable in addition to the limitations set forth by § 428.93(a):
