(b) The following standards of performance establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section and attributable to pan, dry digestion, and mechanical reclaimed rubber processes which are integrated with a wet digestion reclaimed rubber process, which may be discharged by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart, in addition to the limitations set forth by § 428.95:
