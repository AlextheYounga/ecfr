##### § 428.13 Effluent limitations guidelines, representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable. #####

(a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable:

(b) All plants constructed before 1959 shall employ the best available maintenance and housekeeping practices in order to minimize the discharge of oil and grease in nonprocess waste waters. The concentration of oil and grease in discharges of nonprocess waste waters shall meet the following limitations:

(1) The average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed 5 mg/l.

(2) The maximum for any one day shall not exceed 10 mg/l.
