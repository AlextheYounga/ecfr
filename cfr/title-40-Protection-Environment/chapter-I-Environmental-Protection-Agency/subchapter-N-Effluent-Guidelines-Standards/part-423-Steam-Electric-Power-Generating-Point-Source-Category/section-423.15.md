(14) *Flue gas mercury control wastewater.* There shall be no discharge of pollutants in flue gas mercury control wastewater. Whenever flue gas mercury control wastewater is used in any other plant process or is sent to a treatment system at the plant, the resulting effluent must comply with the discharge standard in this paragraph.

(15) *Gasification wastewater.* The quantity of pollutants discharged in gasification wastewater shall not exceed the quantity determined by multiplying the flow of gasification wastewater times the concentration listed in the following table:

(16) *Combustion residual leachate.* The quantity of pollutants discharged in combustion residual leachate shall not exceed the quantity determined by multiplying the flow of combustion residual leachate times the concentration listed in the following table:

|Pollutant or pollutant property|                                       NSPS                                       |   |

(17) At the permitting authority's discretion, the quantity of pollutant allowed to be discharged may be expressed as a concentration limitation instead of any mass based limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(3) through (16) of this section. Concentration limits shall be based on the concentrations specified in this section.

(18) In the event that wastestreams from various sources are combined for treatment or discharge, the quantity of each pollutant or pollutant property controlled in paragraphs (b)(1) through (16) of this section attributable to each controlled waste source shall not exceed the specified limitation for that waste source.

(c) *2024 NSPS for combustion residual leachate.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, there shall be no discharge of pollutants in combustion residual leachate (CRL). Whenever CRL is used in any other plant process or is sent to a treatment system at the plant, the resulting effluent must comply with the discharge standard in this paragraph (c).

(2) After the retirement of all units at a facility, the quantity of pollutants in CRL shall not exceed the quantity determined by multiplying the flow of CRL permeate times the concentrations listed in table 7 to ยง 423.13(g)(3)(i) or the flow of CRL distillate times the concentrations listed in the table in paragraph (b)(13) of this section.
