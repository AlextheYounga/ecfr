(b) There shall be no discharge allowance for process wastewater pollutants from any battery manufacturing operation other than those battery manufacturing operations listed above.

(c)(1) In cases where battery employee shower wastewater containing concentrations of lead exceeding 0.20 mg/l is combined with process wastewaters prior to treatment, the Control Authority may, for purposes of applying the Combined Wastestream Formula under § 403.6(e) of this chapter, notwithstanding the provisions of § 403.6(e), exercise its discretion and classify battery employee shower wastewater as an unregulated rather than a dilute (FD) wastestream.

(2) Before the Control Authority may exercise its discretion to classify such a stream as an unregulated stream, the battery manufacturer must provide engineering, production, and sampling and analysis information sufficient to allow a determination by the Control Authority on how the stream should be classified.
