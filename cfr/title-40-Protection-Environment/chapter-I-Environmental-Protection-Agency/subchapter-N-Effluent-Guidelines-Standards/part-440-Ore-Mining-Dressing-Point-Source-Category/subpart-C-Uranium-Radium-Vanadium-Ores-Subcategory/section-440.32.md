##### ยง 440.32 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT). #####

Except as provided in subpart L of this part and 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable after application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) The concentration of pollutants discharged in mine drainage from mines, either open-pit or underground, from which uranium, radium and vanadium ores are produced excluding mines using in-situ leach methods shall not exceed:
