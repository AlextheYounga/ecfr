(c) The concentration of pollutants discharged in mine drainage from mines engaged in the dredge mining of placer deposits of sands containing rutile, ilmenite, leucoxene, monazite, zircon and the milling techniques employed in conjunction with the dredge mining activity (milling techniques employed include the use of wet gravity methods in conjunction with electrostatic or magnetic methods) shall not exceed:

|          Effluent characteristic           |             Effluent limitations              |              |
