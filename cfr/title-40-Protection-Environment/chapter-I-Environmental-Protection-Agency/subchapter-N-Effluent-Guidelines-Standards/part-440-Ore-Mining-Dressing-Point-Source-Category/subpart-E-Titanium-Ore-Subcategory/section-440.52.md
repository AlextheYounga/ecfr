Except as provided in subpart L of this part and 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable after application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

|                   pH                    |                (<sup>1</sup>)                 |(<sup>1</sup>)|

(b) The concentration of pollutants discharged from mills beneficiating titanium ores by electrostatic methods, magnetic and physical methods, or flotation methods shall not exceed:

|         Effluent characteristic         |             Effluent limitations              |              |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|

(c) The concentration of pollutants discharged in mine drainage from mines engaged in the dredge mining of placer deposits of sands containing rutile, ilmenite, leucoxene, monazite, zircon, or other heavy metals, and the milling techniques employed in conjunction with the dredge mining activity (milling techniques employed include the use of wet gravity methods in conjunction with electrostatic or magnetic methods) shall not exceed:
