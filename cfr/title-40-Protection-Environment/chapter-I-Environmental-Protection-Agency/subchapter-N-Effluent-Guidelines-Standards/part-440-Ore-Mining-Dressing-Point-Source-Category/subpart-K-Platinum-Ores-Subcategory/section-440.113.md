##### ยง 440.113 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT). #####

Except as provided in subpart L of this part and 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT):

(a) The concentration of pollutants discharged in mine drainage from mines that produce platinum bearing ores from open-pit or underground operations other than placer deposits shall not exceed:

|Effluent characteristic|             Effluent limitations              |     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----|
| Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|     |
|                       |             Milligrams per liter              |     |
|          Cu           |                     0.30                      |0.15 |
|          Zn           |                      1.5                      |0.75 |
|          Pb           |                      0.6                      | 0.3 |
|          Hg           |                     0.002                     |0.001|
|          Cd           |                     0.10                      |0.05 |

(b) The concentration of pollutants discharged from mills that use the froth-flotation process alone, or in conjunction with other processes, for the beneficiation of platinum ores shall not exceed:

|Effluent characteristic|             Effluent limitations              |     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----|
| Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|     |

|          Pb           |                      0.6                      | 0.3 |
|          Hg           |                     0.002                     |0.001|
