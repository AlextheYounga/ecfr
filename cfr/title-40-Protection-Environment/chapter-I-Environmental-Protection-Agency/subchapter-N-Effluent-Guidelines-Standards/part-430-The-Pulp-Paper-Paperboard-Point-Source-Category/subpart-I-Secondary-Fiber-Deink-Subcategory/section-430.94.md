##### ยง 430.94 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT). #####

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart where chlorophenolic-containing biocides are used must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT). Non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day mass limitations in kg/kkg (lb/1000 lb) but shall be subject to concentration limitations. Concentration limitations are only applicable to non-continuous dischargers. Permittees not using chlorophenolic-containing biocides must certify to the permit-issuing authority that they are not using these biocides:
