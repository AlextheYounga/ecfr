##### ยง 430.15 New source performance standards (NSPS). #####

Any new source subject to this subpart must achieve the following new source performance standards (NSPS), except that non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations for BOD5 and TSS, but shall be subject to annual average effluent limitations. Also, for non-continuous dischargers, concentration limitations (mg/l) shall apply, where provided. Concentration limitations will only apply to non-continuous dischargers. Only facilities where chlorophenolic-containing biocides are used shall be subject to pentachlorophenol and trichlorophenol limitations. Permittees not using chlorophenolic-containing biocides must certify to the permit-issuing authority that they are not using these biocides:
