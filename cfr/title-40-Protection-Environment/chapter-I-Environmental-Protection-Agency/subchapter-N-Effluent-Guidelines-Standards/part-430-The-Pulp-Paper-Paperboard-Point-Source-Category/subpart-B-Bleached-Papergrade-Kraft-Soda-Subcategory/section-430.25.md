(e) Pursuant to 40 CFR 122.44(i) and 122.45(h), a discharger must demonstrate compliance with the limitations in paragraph (b)(1) or (c)(1) of this section, as applicable, by monitoring for all pollutants (except for AOX, COD, BOD5, TSS, and pH) at the point where the wastewater containing those pollutants leaves the bleach plant. The permitting authority may impose effluent limitations and/or monitoring requirements on internal wastestreams for any other pollutants covered in this section as appropriate under 40 CFR 122.44(i) and 122.45(h). In addition, a discharger subject to a limitation on total pulping area condensate, evaporator condensate, and bleach plant wastewater flow under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must demonstrate compliance with that limitation by establishing and maintaining flow measurement equipment monitoring these flows at the point or points where they leave the pulping area, evaporator area, and the bleach plant.
