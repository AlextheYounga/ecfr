(b) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, resulting from the use of wet barking operations, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart. These limitations are in addition to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and shall be calculated using the proportion of the mill's total production due to use of logs which are subject to such operations. Non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days limitations, but shall be subject to annual average effluent limitations:

(c) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant parameters, controlled by this section, resulting from the use of log washing or chip washing operations, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart. These limitations are in addition to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and shall be calculated using the proportion of the mill's total production due to use of logs and/or chips which are subject to such operations.

(d) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, resulting from the use of log flumes or log ponds, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart. These limitations are in addition to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and shall be calculated using the proportion of the mill's total production due to use of logs which are subject to such operations.
