(d) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, resulting from the use of log flumes or log ponds, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart. These limitations are in addition to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and shall be calculated using the proportion of the mill's total production due to use of logs which are subject to such operations. Non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days limitations but shall be subject to the annual average effluent limitations:

(e) For those mills using zinc hydrosulfite as a bleaching agent in the manufacturing process, the following effluent limitations are to be added to the base limitations set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. Permittees not using zinc hydrosulfite as a bleaching agent must certify to the permit issuing authority that they are not using this bleaching compound. Non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day and average of 30 consecutive days effluent limitations, but shall be subject to annual average effluent limitations:
