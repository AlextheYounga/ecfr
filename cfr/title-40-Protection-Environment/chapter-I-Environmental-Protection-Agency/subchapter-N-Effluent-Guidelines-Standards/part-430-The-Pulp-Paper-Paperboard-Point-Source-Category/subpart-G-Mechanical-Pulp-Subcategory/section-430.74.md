##### ยง 430.74 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT). #####

(a) The following applies to mechanical pulp facilities where pulp and paper at groundwood mills are produced through the application of the thermo-mechanical process; mechanical pulp facilities where the integrated production of pulp and coarse paper, molded pulp products, and newsprint at groundwood mills occurs; and mechanical pulp facilities where the integrated production of pulp and fine paper at groundwood mills occurs: except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT), except that non-continuous dischargers shall not be subject to the maximum day mass limitations in kg/kkg (lb/1000 lb), but shall be subject to concentration limitations. Concentration limitations are only applicable to non-continuous dischargers. Pentachlorophenol and trichlorophenol limitations are only applicable at facilities where chlorophenolic-containing biocides are used. Permittees not using chlorophenolic-containing biocides must certify to the permit-issuing authority that they are not using these biocides. Zinc limitations are only applicable at facilities where zinc hydrosulfite is used as a bleaching agent. Permittees not using zinc hydrosulfite as a bleaching agent must certify to the permit issuing authority that they are not using this bleaching compound:
