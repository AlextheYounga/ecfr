##### ยง 430.76 Pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES). #####

(a) The following applies to mechanical pulp facilities where pulp and paper at groundwood mills are produced through the application of the thermo-mechanical process; mechanical pulp facilities where the integrated production of pulp and coarse paper, molded pulp products, and newsprint at groundwood mills occurs; and mechanical pulp facilities where the integrated production of pulp and fine paper at groundwood mills occurs: except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES). Pentachlorophenol and trichlorophenol limitations are only applicable at facilities where chlorophenolic-containing biocides are used. Permittees not using chlorophenolic-containing biocides must certify to the permit-issuing authority that they are not using these biocides. Zinc limitations are only applicable at facilities where zinc hydrosulfite is used as a bleaching agent. Permittees not using zinc hydrosulfite as a bleaching agent must certify to the permit-issuing authority that they are not using this bleaching compound. PSES must be attained on or before July 1, 1984:
