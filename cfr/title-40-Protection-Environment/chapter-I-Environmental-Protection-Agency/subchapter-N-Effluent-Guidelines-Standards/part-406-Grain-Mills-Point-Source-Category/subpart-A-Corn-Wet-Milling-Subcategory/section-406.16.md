##### § 406.16 Pretreatment standards for new sources. #####

Any new source subject to this subpart that introduces process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403. In addition, the provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section apply, as well as the following pretreatment standard which establishes the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this section which may be discharged to publicly owned treatment works by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart.

|Pollutant or pollutant property|Pretreatment standard|
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
|              pH               |   No limitation.    |
|             BOD5              |         Do.         |
|              TSS              |         Do.         |

(a) Process waste water shall not be discharged to a POTW at a flow rate or pollutant mass loading rate which is excessive over any time period during the peak load at a POTW. Excessive discharges are defined as those in which the flow of BOD*5* or total suspended solids (TSS) exceed the respective values of P from the following formula:

P = K(Q + R)−Swhere:P = maximum allowable peak waste load for the new corn wet milling source to be discharged to the POTW (gallons per one hour for flow and pounds per day for BOD*5* and TSS).Q = average existing waste load to POTW.R = average waste load for the new corn wet milling source to be discharged to POTW.S = existing peak load of POTW.K = 2. When the ratio of (S/Q) is greater than 1.5, K = 3.

Calculations are to be based on dry weather conditions.
