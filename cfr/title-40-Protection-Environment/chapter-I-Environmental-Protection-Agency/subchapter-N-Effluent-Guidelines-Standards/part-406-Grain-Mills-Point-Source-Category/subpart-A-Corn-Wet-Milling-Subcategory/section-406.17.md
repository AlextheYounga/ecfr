##### § 406.17 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology. #####

The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best conventional pollutant control technology.

(a) Subject to the provisions in paragraph (b) of this section, the following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable:

|         Effluent characteristic         |                      Effluent limitations                       |              |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
|          Maximum for any 1 day          |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|              |
|                                         |          Metric units (kilograms per 1,000 kg of corn)          |              |

|                  BOD5                   |                               60                                |      20      |
|                   TSS                   |                               90                                |      30      |
|                   pH                    |                         (<sup>1</sup>)                          |(<sup>1</sup>)|
|<sup>1</sup> Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.|                                                                 |              |

(b) The limitations given in paragraph (a) of this section for BOD*5* and TSS are derived for a point source producing products standard to the corn wet milling industry. For those plants producing modified starches at a rate of at least 15 percent by dry-basis weight of total sweetener and starch products per month for 12 consecutive months, the following limitations should be used to derive an additive adjustment to the discharge allowed by paragraph (a) of this section:
