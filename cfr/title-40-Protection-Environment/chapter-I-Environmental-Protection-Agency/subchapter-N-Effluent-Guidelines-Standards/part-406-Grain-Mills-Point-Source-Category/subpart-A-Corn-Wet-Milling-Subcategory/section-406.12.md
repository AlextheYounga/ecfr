##### § 406.12 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

(a) Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, and subject to the provisions in paragraph (b) of this section, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

|         Effluent characteristic         |                      Effluent limitations                       |              |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
|          Maximum for any 1 day          |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|              |
|                                         |          Metric units (kilograms per 1,000 kg of corn)          |              |
|                  BOD5                   |                              2.67                               |     0.89     |
|                   TSS                   |                              4.32                               |     1.08     |
|                   pH                    |                         (<sup>1</sup>)                          |(<sup>1</sup>)|
|                                         |         English units (pounds per 1,000 stdbu of corn)          |              |
|                  BOD5                   |                               150                               |      50      |
|                   TSS                   |                               240                               |      60      |
|                   pH                    |                         (<sup>1</sup>)                          |(<sup>1</sup>)|
|<sup>1</sup> Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.|                                                                 |              |

(b) The limitations given in paragraph (a) of this section for BOD*5* and TSS are derived for a point source producing products standards to the corn wet milling industry. For those plants producing modified starches at a rate of at least 15 percent by dry-basis weight of total sweetener and starch products per month for 12 consecutive months, the following limitations should be used to derive an additive adjustment to the discharge allowed by paragraph (a) of this section:

|Effluent characteristic|                      Effluent limitations                       |    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----|
| Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|    |
|                       |          Metric units (kilograms per 1,000 kg of corn)          |    |

|          TSS          |                               120                               | 30 |
