##### § 409.22 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) Any crystalline cane sugar refinery discharging both barometric condenser cooling water and other process waters shall meet the following limitations. The BOD*5* limitation is determined by the addition of the net BOD*5* attributed to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BOD*5* attributed to the treated process water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributed to the treated process water. Where the barometric condenser cooling water and process water streams are mixed and impossible to measure separately prior to discharge, the values should be considered net.
