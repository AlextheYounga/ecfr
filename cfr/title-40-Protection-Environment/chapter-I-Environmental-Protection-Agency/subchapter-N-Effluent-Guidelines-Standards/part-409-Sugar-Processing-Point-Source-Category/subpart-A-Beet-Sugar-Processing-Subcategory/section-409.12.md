##### § 409.12 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best practicable control technology currently available; provided however, that a discharge by a point source may be made in accordance with the limitations set forth in either paragraph (a) of this section exclusively, or paragraph (b) of this section exclusively, below:

(a) The following limitations establish the maximum permissible discharge of process waste water pollutants when the process waste water discharge results from barometric condensing operations only.
