##### § 409.42 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) Any cane sugar factory continuously discharging both barometric condenser cooling water and other process waste waters shall meet the following limitations. The BOD*5* limitation is determined by the addition of the net BOD*5* attributable to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BOD*5* attributable to the treated process waste water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributable to the treated process waste water, excluding barometric condenser cooling water.

(b) Any cane sugar factory employing waste stabilization where all or a portion of the waste water discharge is stored for the entire grinding season shall meet the following limitations. The BOD*5* limitation is determined by the addition of the net BOD*5* attributable to the barometric condenser cooling water to that amount of BOD*5* attributable to the treated process waste water. The TSS limitation is that amount of TSS attributable to the treated process waste water, excluding barometric condenser cooling water.
