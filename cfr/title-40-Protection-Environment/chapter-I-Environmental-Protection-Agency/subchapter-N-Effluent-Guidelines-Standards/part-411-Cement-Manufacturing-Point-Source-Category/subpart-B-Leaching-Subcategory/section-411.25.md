|Effluent characteristic|  Effluent limitations (maximum for any 1 day)  |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|                       |     Metric units (kg/kkg of dust leached)      |
|          TSS          |                      0.4.                      |
|  Temperature (heat)   |Not to exceed 3 °C rise above inlet temperature.|
|          pH           |          Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.          |
|                       |  English units (lb/1,000 lb of dust leached)   |
|          TSS          |                      0.4.                      |
|  Temperature (heat)   |Not to exceed 3 °C rise above inlet temperature.|
|          pH           |          Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.          |
