##### § 426.115 Standards of performance for new sources. #####

The following standards of performance establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart (the fluoride and lead limitations are applicable to the abrasive polishing and acid polishing waste water streams while the TSS, oil, and pH limitations are applicable to the entire process waste water stream):
