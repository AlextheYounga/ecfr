##### § 426.112 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT). (The fluoride and lead limitations are applicable to the abrasive polishing and acid polishing waste water streams while the TSS, oil, and pH limitations are applicable to the entire process waste water stream):
