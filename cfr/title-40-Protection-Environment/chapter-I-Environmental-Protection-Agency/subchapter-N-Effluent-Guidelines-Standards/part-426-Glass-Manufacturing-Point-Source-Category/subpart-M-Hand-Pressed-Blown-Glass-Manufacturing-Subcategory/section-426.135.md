##### § 426.135 Standards of performance for new sources. #####

The following standards of performance establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart:

(a) Any plant which melts raw materials, produces hand pressed or blown leaded glassware, discharges greater than 50 gallons per day of process waste water, and employs hydrofluoric acid finishing techniques shall meet the following limitations.

|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
|          Maximum for any 1 day          |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|              |

(b) Any plant which melts raw materials, produces non-leaded hand pressed or blown glassware, discharges greater than 50 gallons per day of process waste water, and employs hydrofluoric acid finishing techniques shall meet the following limitations.

|         Effluent characteristic         |                   Effluent limitations (mg/l)                   |              |

(c) Any plant which melts raw materials, produces leaded or non-leaded hand pressed or blown glassware, discharges greater than 50 gallons per day of process waste water, and does not employ hydrofluoric acid finishing techniques shall meet the following limitations.
