##### § 426.126 Pretreatment standards for new sources. #####

Any new source subject to this subpart that introduces process wastewater pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403. In addition, the following pretreatment standard establishes the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this section which may be discharged to a publicly owned treatment works by a new point source subject to the provisions of this subpart. Because of the recognition that animal and vegetable oils can be adequately removed in a publicly owned treatment works, whereas mineral oil may not be readily removed and may pass through untreated, two separate limitations are established.
