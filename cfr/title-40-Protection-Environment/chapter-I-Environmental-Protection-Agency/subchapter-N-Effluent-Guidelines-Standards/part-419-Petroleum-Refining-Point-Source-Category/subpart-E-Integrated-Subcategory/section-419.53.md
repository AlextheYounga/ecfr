(c)(1) In addition to the provisions contained above pertaining to COD, ammonia and sulfide, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable (BAT):

(i) For each of the regulated pollutant parameters listed below, the effluent limitation for a given refinery is the sum of the products of each effluent limitation factor times the applicable process feedstock rate, calculated as provided in 40 CFR 122.45(b). Applicable production processes are presented in appendix A, by process type. The process identification numbers presented in this appendix A are for the convenience of the reader. They can be cross-referenced in the *Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards, and Pretreatment Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category* (EPA 440/1-82/014), Table III-7, pp. 49-54.

(d) The provisions of § 419.13(d) apply to discharges of process wastewater pollutants attributable to ballast water by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart.

(e) The quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph, attributable to once-through cooling water, are excluded from the discharge allowed by paragraph (b) of this section. Once-through cooling water may be discharged with a total organic carbon concentration not to exceed 5 mg/l.

(f) *Effluent limitations for contaminated runoff.* The following effluent limitations constitute the quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph and attributable to contaminated runoff, which may be discharged after the application of the best available technology economically achievable by a point source subject to this subpart.

(1) If wastewater consists solely of contaminated runoff and is not commingled or treated with process wastewater, it may be discharged if it does not exceed 110 mg/l total organic carbon (TOC) based upon an analysis of any single grab or composite sample.

(2) If contaminated runoff is commingled or treated with process wastewater, or if wastewater consisting solely of contaminated runoff which exceeds 110 mg/l TOC is not commingled or treated with any other type of wastewater, the quantity of pollutants discharged shall not exceed the quantity determined by multiplying the flow of contaminated runoff as determined by the permit writer times the concentrations listed in the following table:

|<sup>1</sup> In any case in which the applicant can demonstrate that the chloride ion concentration in the effluent exceeds 1,000 mg/l (1,000 ppm), the permitting authority may substitute TOC as a parameter in lieu of COD. A TOC effluent limitation shall be based on effluent data from the particular refinery which correlates TOC to BOD<sub>5</sub>. If in the judgement of the permitting authority, adequate correlation data are not available, the effluent limitations for TOC shall be established at a ratio of 2.2 to 1 to the applicable effluent limitations for BOD<sub>5</sub>|                                                                |       |
