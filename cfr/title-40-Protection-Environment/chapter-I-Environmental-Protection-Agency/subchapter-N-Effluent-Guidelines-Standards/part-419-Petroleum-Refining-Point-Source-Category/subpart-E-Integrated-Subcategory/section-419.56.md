(b) The limits set forth in paragraph (a) of this section are to be multiplied by the following factors to calculate the maximum for any one day and maximum average of daily values for thirty consecutive days.

(1) Size factor.

(3) See the comprehensive example in subpart D, ยง 419.42(b)(3).

(c) The provisions of ยง 419.16(c) apply to discharges of process wastewater pollutants attributable to ballast water by a point source subject to the provision of this subpart.

(d) The quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph, attributable to once-through cooling water, are excluded from the discharge allowed by paragraph (b) of this section. Once-through cooling water may be discharged with a total organic carbon concentration not to exceed 5 mg/l.

(e) *Effluent limitations for runoff.* [Reserved]
