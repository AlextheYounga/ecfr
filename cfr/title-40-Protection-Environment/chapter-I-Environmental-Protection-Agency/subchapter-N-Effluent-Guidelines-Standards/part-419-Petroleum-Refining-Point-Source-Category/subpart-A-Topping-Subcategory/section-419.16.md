(c) The following allocations constitute the quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph and attributable to ballast, which may be discharged after the application of best practicable control technology currently available, by a point source subject to this subpart, in addition to the discharge allowed by paragraph (b) of this section. The allocation allowed for ballast water flow, as kg/cu m (lb/Mgal), shall be based on those ballast waters treated at the refinery.
