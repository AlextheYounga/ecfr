(3) See the comprehensive example in subpart D, ยง 419.42(b)(3).

(c) The provisions of ยง 419.16(c) apply to discharges of process wastewater pollutants attributable to ballast water by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart.

(d) The quantity and quality of pollutants or pollutant properties controlled by this paragraph, attributable to once-through cooling water, are excluded from the discharge allowed by paragraph (b) of this section. Once-through cooling water may be discharged with a total organic carbon concentration not to exceed 5 mg/l.

(e) *Effluent limitation for runoff.* [Reserved]
