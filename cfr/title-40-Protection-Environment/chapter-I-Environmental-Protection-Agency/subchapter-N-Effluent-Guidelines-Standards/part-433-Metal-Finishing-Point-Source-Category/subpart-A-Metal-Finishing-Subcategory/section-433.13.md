##### § 433.13 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by applying the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT). #####

(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by applying the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
|                               |Milligrams per liter (mg/l)|                                |

|              TTO              |           2.13            |                                |
|         Oil & Grease          |            52             |               26               |
|              TSS              |            60             |               31               |
|              pH               |      (<sup>1</sup>)       |         (<sup>1</sup>)         |
|<sup>1</sup> Within 6.0 to 9.0.|                           |                                |

(b) Alternatively, for industrial facilities with cyanide treatment, and upon agreement between a source subject to those limits and the pollution control authority, the following amenable cyanide limit may apply in place of the total cyanide limit specified in paragraph (a) of this section:

|Pollutant or pollutant property|   Maximum for any 1 day   |Monthly average shall not exceed|
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------|
|                               |Milligrams per liter (mg/l)|                                |
|          Cyanide (A)          |           0.86            |              0.32              |

(c) No user subject to the provisions of this subpart shall augment the use of process wastewater or otherwise dilute the wastewater as a partial or total substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with this limitation.
