##### § 410.52 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT). #####

(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

|           Pollutant or pollutant property            |                BPT limitations                |              |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
|                Maximum for any 1 day                 |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|              |
|                                                      |  Kg/kkg (or pounds per 1,000 lb) of product   |              |
|                         BOD5                         |                      5.0                      |     2.5      |

|<sup>1</sup> Within the range 6.0 to 9.0 at all times.|                                               |              |

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for commission finishing operations, the following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section and attributable to the finishing of knit fabrics through simple manufacturing operations employing a natural and synthetic fiber or through complex manufacturing operations employing a synthetic fiber, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart, in addition to the discharge allowed by paragraph (a) of this section.

|Pollutant or pollutant property|                BPT limitations                |    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----|
|     Maximum for any 1 day     |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|    |
|                               |  Kg/kkg (or pounds per 1,000 lb) of product   |    |
|              COD              |                     20.0                      |10.0|

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for commission finishing operations, the following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section and attributable to the finishing of knit fabrics through complex manufacturing operations employing a natural and synthetic fiber blend, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart, in addition to the discharge allowed by paragraph (a) of this section.

|Pollutant or pollutant property|                BPT limitations                |    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----|
|     Maximum for any 1 day     |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|    |

|              COD              |                     40.0                      |20.0|

(d) Additional allocations equal to the effluent limitations established in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are allowed any existing point source subject to such effluent limitations that finishes knit fabrics through “commission finishing” as defined in § 410.01.
