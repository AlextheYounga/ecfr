##### ยง 463.24 New source performance standards. #####

Any new source subject to this subpart must achieve performance standards (*i.e.*, mass of pollutant discharged) calculated by multiplying the average process water usage flow rate for cleaning processes at a new source times the following pollutant concentrations:

|          Concentration used to calculate NSPS           |                            |                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
|             Pollutant or pollutant property             |Maximum for any 1 day (mg/l)|Maximum for monthly average (mg/l)|
|                     BOD<sub>5</sub>                     |             49             |                22                |
|                     Oil and Grease                      |             71             |                17                |
|                           TSS                           |            117             |                36                |
|                           pH                            |       (<sup>1</sup>)       |          (<sup>1</sup>)          |
|<sup>1</sup> Within the range of 6.0 to 9.0 at all times.|                            |                                  |

The permit authority will obtain the average process water usage flow rate for the new source cleaning water processes from the permittee.
