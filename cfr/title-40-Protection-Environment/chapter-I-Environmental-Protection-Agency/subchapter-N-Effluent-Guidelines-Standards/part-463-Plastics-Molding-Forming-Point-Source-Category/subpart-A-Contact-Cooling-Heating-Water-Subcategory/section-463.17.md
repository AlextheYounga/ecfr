##### § 463.17 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology. #####

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the effluent limitations guidelines (*i.e.*, mass of pollutant discharged) representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best conventional pollutant control technology, which are calculated by multiplying the average process water usage flow rate for the contact cooling and heating water processes at a point source times the following pollutant concentrations:

|Concentration used to calculate BCT effluent limitations |                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
|             Pollutant or pollutant property             |Maximum for any 1 day (mg/l)|
|                     BOD<sub>5</sub>                     |             26             |
|                     Oil and grease                      |             29             |
|                           TSS                           |             19             |
|                           pH                            |       (<sup>1</sup>)       |
|<sup>1</sup> Within the range of 6.0 to 9.0 at all times.|                            |

The permit authority will obtain the average process water usage flow rate for the contact cooling and heating water processes from the permittee.
