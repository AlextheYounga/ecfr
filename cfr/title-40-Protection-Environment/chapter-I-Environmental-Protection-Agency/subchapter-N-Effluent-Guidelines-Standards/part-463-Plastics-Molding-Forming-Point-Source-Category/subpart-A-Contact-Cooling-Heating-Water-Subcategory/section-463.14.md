##### ยง 463.14 New source performance standards. #####

(a) NSPS for bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate are reserved.

(b) Any new source subject to this subpart must achieve performance standards (*i.e.*, mass of pollutant discharged), which are calculated by multiplying the average process water usage flow rate for the contact cooling and heating water processes at a new source times the following pollutant concentrations:

|          Concentration used to calculate NSPS           |                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
|             Pollutant or pollutant property             |Maximum for any 1 day (mg/l)|
|                     BOD<sub>5</sub>                     |             26             |
|                     Oil and grease                      |             29             |
|                           TSS                           |             19             |
|                           pH                            |       (<sup>1</sup>)       |
|<sup>1</sup> Within the range of 6.0 to 9.0 at all times.|                            |

The permit authority will obtain the average process water usage flow rate for the new source contact cooling and heating water processes from the permittee.
