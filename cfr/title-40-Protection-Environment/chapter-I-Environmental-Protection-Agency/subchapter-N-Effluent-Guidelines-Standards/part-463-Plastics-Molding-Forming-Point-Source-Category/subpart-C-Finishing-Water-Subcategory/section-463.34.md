##### ยง 463.34 New source performance standards. #####

(a) NSPS for bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, and dimethyl phthalate are reserved.

(b) Any new source subject to this subpart must achieve performance standards (*i.e.*, mass of pollutant discharged), which are calculated by multiplying the average process water usage flow rate for the finishing water processes at a new source times the following pollutant concentrations:

|          Concentration used to calculate NSPS           |                            |                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
|             Pollutant or pollutant property             |Maximum for any 1 day (mg/l)|Maximum for monthly average (mg/l)|
|                           TSS                           |            130             |                37                |
|                           pH                            |       (<sup>1</sup>)       |          (<sup>1</sup>)          |
|<sup>1</sup> Within the range of 6.0 to 9.0 at all times.|                            |                                  |

The permit authority will obtain the average process water usage flow rate for the new source finishing water processes from the permittee.
