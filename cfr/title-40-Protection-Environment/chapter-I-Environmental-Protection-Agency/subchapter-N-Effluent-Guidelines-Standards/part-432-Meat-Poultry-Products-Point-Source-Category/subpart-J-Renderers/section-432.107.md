##### § 432.107 Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best control technology for conventional pollutants (BCT). #####

(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BCT: Limitations for BOD5, fecal coliform, O&G, and TSS are the same as the corresponding limitation specified in § 432.105(a).

(b) The limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in paragraph (a) of this section were derived for a renderer which does not cure cattle hide. If a renderer does cure hide, the following formulas should be used to calculate BOD5 and TSS limitations for process wastewater associated with cattle hide curing, in addition to the limitation specified in paragraph (a) of this section:

lbs BOD5/1000 lbs RM = 7.9 × (no. of hides)/lbs RM kg BOD5/kkg RM = 3.6 × (no. of hides)/kg RM lbs TSS/1000 lbs RM = 13.6 × (no. of hides)/lbs RM kg TSS/kkg RM = 6.2 × (no. of hides)/kg RM
