##### § 432.102 Effluent limitations attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT). #####

(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the application of BPT:

|                    Regulated  <br/>parameter                     |Maximum daily <sup>1</sup>|Maximum monthly avg. <sup>1</sup>|

|                               TSS                                |           0.42           |              0.21               |
| <sup>1</sup> Pounds per 1000 lbs (or g/kg) of raw material (RM). |                          |                                 |
|  <sup>2</sup> Maximum of 400 MPN or CFU per 100 mL at any time.  |                          |                                 |
|       <sup>3</sup> No maximum monthly average limitation.        |                          |                                 |
|<sup>4</sup> May be measured as hexane extractable material (HEM).|                          |                                 |

(b) The limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in paragraph (a) of this section were derived for a renderer which does not cure cattle hide. If a renderer does cure cattle hide, the following formulas should be used to calculate BOD5 and TSS limitations for process wastewater associated with cattle hide curing that apply in addition to the limitation specified in paragraph (a) of this section:

lbs BOD5/1000 lbs RM = 17.6 × (no. of hides)/lbs RMkg BOD5/kkg RM = 8 × (no. of hides)/kg RM lbs TSS/1000 lbs RM = 24.2 × (no. of hides)/lbs RM kg TSS/kkg RM = 11 × (no. of hides)/kg RM
