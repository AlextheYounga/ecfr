|         <sup>1</sup> Pounds per 1000 lbs (or g/kg) LWK.          |                          |                                 |
|  <sup>2</sup> Maximum of 400 MPN or CFU per 100 mL at any time.  |                          |                                 |
|       <sup>3</sup> No maximum monthly average limitation.        |                          |                                 |
|<sup>4</sup> May be measured as hexane extractable material (HEM).|                          |                                 |

(2) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing (defleshing, washing and curing) of hides derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(2) apply.

(3) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing of blood derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(3) apply.

(4) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the wet or low-temperature rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(4) apply.

(5) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the dry rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in § 432.12(a)(5) apply.

(b) Facilities that slaughter more than 50 million pounds per year (in units of LWK) must achieve the following limitations:

(1) All facilities must achieve the following effluent limitation for ammonia (as N):

|Regulated  <br/>parameter|Maximum daily <sup>1</sup>|Maximum monthly avg. <sup>1</sup>|
|-------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
|     Ammonia (as N)      |           8.0            |               4.0               |
|<sup>1</sup> mg/L (ppm). |                          |                                 |

(2) In the case of process wastewater associated with the slaughtering of animals on-site or the processing of the carcasses of animals slaughtered on-site, the limitations for BOD5, fecal coliform, O&G, and TSS are the same as the corresponding limitations specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(3) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing (defleshing, washing and curing) of hides derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply.

(4) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the processing of blood derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site, the limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section apply.

(5) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the wet or low-temperature rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section apply.

(6) In addition to the limitations specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, in the case of process wastewater associated with the dry rendering of material derived from animals slaughtered at locations off-site and dead animals, the limitations for BOD5 and TSS specified in paragraph (a)(5) of this section apply.
