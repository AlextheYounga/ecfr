##### ยง 455.25 New source performance standards (NSPS). #####

(a) Any new source subject to this subpart which discharges process wastewater pollutants must achieve the new source performance standards specified in 40 CFR 455.20(d), and subject to 455.20(a), must meet the following standards for BOD5, TSS, COD and pH:

|                          Pollutant or pollutant property                           |Maximum for any one day\*\*|Average of daily values shall not exceed\*\*|
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|                                        COD                                         |           9.360           |                   6.480                    |
|                                  BOD<sub>5</sub>                                   |           5.328           |                   1.1520                   |
|                                        TSS                                         |           4.392           |                   1.2960                   |
|                                         pH                                         |            \*             |                     \*                     |

|\*\* Metric units: Kilogram pollutant /1,000 kg of total organic active ingredients.|                           |                                            |
|    English units: Pound pollutant/1,000 lb of total organic active ingredients     |                           |                                            |

(b) For the priority pollutants, such sources must achieve discharges not exceeding the quantity (mass) determined by multiplying the process wastewater flow subject to this subpart as defined in 40 CFR 455.21(d) times the concentrations listed in table 4 or table 5 of this part, as appropriate, of this subpart.
