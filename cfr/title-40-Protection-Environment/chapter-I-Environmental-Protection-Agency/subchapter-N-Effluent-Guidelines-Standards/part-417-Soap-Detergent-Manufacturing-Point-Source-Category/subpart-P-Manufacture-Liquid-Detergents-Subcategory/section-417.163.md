##### § 417.163 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable. #####

The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this section, which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable:

(a) For normal liquid detergent operations the following values pertain:
