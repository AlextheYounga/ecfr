##### § 405.102 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) For milk drying plants with an input equivalent to more than 145,000 lb/day of milk equivalent (more than 15,070 lb/day of BOD*5* input).
