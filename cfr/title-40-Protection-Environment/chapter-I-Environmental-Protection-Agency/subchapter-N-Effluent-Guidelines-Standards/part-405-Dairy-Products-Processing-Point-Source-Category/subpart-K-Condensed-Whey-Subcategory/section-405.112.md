##### § 405.112 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) For whey condensing plants with over 300,000 lb/day of fluid raw whey input (over 20,700 lb/day of solids or 14,160 lb/day of BOD*5* input).
