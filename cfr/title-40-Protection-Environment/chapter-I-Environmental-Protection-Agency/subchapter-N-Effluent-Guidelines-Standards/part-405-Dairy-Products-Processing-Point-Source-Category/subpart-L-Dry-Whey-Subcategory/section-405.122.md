##### § 405.122 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) For whey drying plants with an input equivalent to more than 57,000 lb/day of 40 percent solids whey (22,800 lb/day of solids or 15,620 lb/day of BOD*5* input).
