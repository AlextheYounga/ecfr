##### § 405.22 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available. #####

Except as provided in §§ 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart shall achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) For fluid products plants receiving more than 250,000 lb/day of milk equivalent (more than 25,900 lb/day of BOD*5* input).
