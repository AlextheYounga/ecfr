|         Effluent characteristic         |                      Effluent limitations                       |              |

|          Maximum for any 1 day          |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|              |
|                   TSS                   |                             60 mg/l                             |  30 mg./l.   |
|                   pH                    |                         (<sup>1</sup>)                          |(<sup>1</sup>)|

(b) Any overflow from facilities governed by this subpart shall not be subject to the limitations of paragraph (a) of this section if the facilities are designed, constructed and maintained to contain or treat the volume of waste water which would result from a 10-year 24-hour precipitation event.
