##### § 418.55 Standards of performance for new sources. #####

The following standards of performance establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged by a new source subject to the provisions of this subpart:

(a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants which may be discharged in process waste water from nitric acid production in which all the raw material ammonia is in the gaseous form:

|Effluent characteristic|                      Effluent limitations                       |       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|       |
|    Ammonia (as N)     |                             0.0045                              |0.00045|
|    Nitrate (as N)     |                              0.17                               | 0.023 |

(b) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants which may be discharged in process waste water from nitric acid production in which all the raw material ammonia is in the shipped liquid form:

|Effluent characteristic|                      Effluent limitations                       |     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|     |
|    Ammonia (as N)     |                              0.08                               |0.008|
|    Nitrate (as N)     |                              0.17                               |0.023|
