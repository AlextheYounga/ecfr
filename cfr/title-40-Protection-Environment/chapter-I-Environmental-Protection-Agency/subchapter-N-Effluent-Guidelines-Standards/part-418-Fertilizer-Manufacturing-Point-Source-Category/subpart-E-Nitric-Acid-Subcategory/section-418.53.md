##### § 418.53 Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best available technology economically achievable. #####

The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants or pollutant properties which may be discharged by a point source subject to the provisions of this subpart after application of the best available technology economically achievable:

(a) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants which may be discharged in process waste water from nitric acid production in which all the raw material ammonia is in the gaseous form:

|Effluent characteristic|                      Effluent limitations                       |       |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|       |
|    Ammonia (as N)     |                             0.0045                              |0.00045|
|    Nitrate (as N)     |                              0.17                               | 0.023 |

(b) The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of pollutants which may be discharged in process waste water from nitric acid production in which all the raw material ammonia is in the shipped liquid form:

|Effluent characteristic|                      Effluent limitations                       |     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----|
| Maximum for any 1 day |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|     |
|    Ammonia (as N)     |                              0.08                               |0.008|
|    Nitrate (as N)     |                              0.17                               |0.023|
