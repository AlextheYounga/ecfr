(b) The following limitations constitute the maximum permissible discharge for urea manufacturing operations in which urea is prilled or granulated:

|                                   Effluent characteristics                                    |                   Effluent limitations (mg/l)                   |    |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----|
|                                     Maximum for any 1 day                                     |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days shall not exceed—|    |
|                                        Ammonia (as N)                                         |                              1.18                               |0.59|
|                                    Organic nitrogen (as N)                                    |                              1.48                               |0.80|
|**Note:** Metric units: Kilogram/1,000 kg of product; English units: Pound/1,000 lb of product.|                                                                 |    |
