##### ยง 429.31 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT). #####

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) The following limitations constitute the maximum permissible discharge for all veneer manufacturing installations other than those referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section: There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants into navigable waters.

(b) The following limitations constitute the maximum permissible discharge for softwood veneer manufacturing processes which use direct steaming for the conditioning of logs:
