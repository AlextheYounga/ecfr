##### ยง 429.61 Effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT). #####

Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

(a) The following limitations apply to plants which produce smooth-one-side (S1S) hardboard:

|           Pollutant or pollutant property            |           BPT Effluent Limitations            |              |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
|                Maximum for any 1 day                 |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|              |

|<sup>1</sup> Within the range 6.0 to 9.0 at all times.|                                               |              |

(b) The following limitations apply to plants which produce smooth-two-sides (S2S) hardboard:

|           Pollutant or pollutant property            |           BPT Effluent Limitations            |              |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|
|                Maximum for any 1 day                 |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|              |
|                                                      |   kg/(kkg (lb/1000 lb) of gross production    |              |
|                   BOD<sub>5</sub>                    |                     32.9                      |     21.4     |
