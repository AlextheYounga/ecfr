##### ยง 415.474 Pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES). #####

(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart and producing nickel sulfate, nickel chloride, nickel nitrate, or nickel fluoborate which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES):

|Pollutant or pollutant property|           PSES effluent limitations           |    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----|
|     Maximum for any 1 day     |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|    |
|                               |          Milligrams per liter (mg/l)          |    |
|           Copper(T)           |                      1.1                      |0.36|
|           Nickel(T)           |                      1.1                      |0.36|

In cases where POTWs find it necessary to impose mass limitations, the following equivalent mass limitations are provided as an alternate: The limitations for copper (T) and nickel (T) are the same as specified in ยง 415.473(a).

(b) Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart and producing nickel carbonate which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES):

|Pollutant or pollutant property|           PSES effluent limitations           |    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----|
|     Maximum for any 1 day     |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|    |
|                               |          Milligrams per liter (mg/l)          |    |
|           Copper(T)           |                      1.1                      |0.36|
|           Nickel(T)           |                      1.1                      |0.36|

In cases where POTWs find it necessary to impose mass limitations, the following equivalent mass limitations are provided as an alternate: The limitations for copper (T) and nickel (T) are the same as specified in ยง 415.473(b).
