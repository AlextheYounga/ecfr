|<sup>1</sup> Within the range 6.0 to 9.0.|                                               |              |

(b) Except as provided in 40 CFR 125.30 through 125.32, any existing point source subject to this subpart and using the recovery process from Solvay process wastes, must achieve the following effluent limitations representing the degree of effluent reduction attainable by the application of the best practicable control technology currently available (BPT):

|     Pollutant or pollutant property     |                BPT limitations                |              |
