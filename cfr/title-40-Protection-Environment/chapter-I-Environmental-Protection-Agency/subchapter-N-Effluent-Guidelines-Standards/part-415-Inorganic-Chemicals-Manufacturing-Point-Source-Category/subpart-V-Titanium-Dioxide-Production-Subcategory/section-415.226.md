##### § 415.226 Pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS). #####

(a) Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart and producing titanium dioxide by the sulfate process which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS):

|Pollutant or pollutant property|           PSNS effluent limitations           |    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----|
|     Maximum for any 1 day     |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|    |
|                               |          Milligrams per liter (mg/1)          |    |
|           Iron (T)            |                      8.5                      |2.5 |
|         Chromium (T)          |                     0.57                      |0.30|
|          Nickel (T)           |                     0.38                      |0.20|

In cases where POTWs find it necessary to impose mass limitations, the following equivalent mass limitations are provided as an alternate: The limitations for Iron(T), Chromium(T), and Nickel(T) are the same as specified in § 415.225(a).

(b) Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart and producing titanium dioxide by the chloride process which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS):

|Pollutant or pollutant property|           PSNS effluent limitations           |    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----|
|     Maximum for any 1 day     |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|    |
|                               |          Milligrams per liter (mg/1)          |    |
|           Iron (T)            |                      5.3                      |1.6 |
|         Chromium (T)          |                     0.23                      |0.12|

In cases where POTWs find it necessary to impose mass limitations, the following equivalent mass limitations are provided as guidance: The limitations for Iron(T) and Chromium(T) are the same as specified in § 415.255(b).

(c) Except as provided in § 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart and producing titanium dioxide by the simultaneous beneficiation-chlorination (chloride-ilmenite) process which introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and achieve the following pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS):

|Pollutant or pollutant property|           PSNS effluent limitations           |    |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----|
|     Maximum for any 1 day     |Average of daily values for 30 consecutive days|    |
|                               |          Milligrams per liter (mg/l)          |    |
|           Iron (T)            |                      5.3                      |1.6 |
|         Chromium (T)          |                     0.23                      |0.12|
|          Nickel (T)           |                     0.33                      |0.17|

In cases where POTWs find it necessary to impose mass limitations, the following equivalent mass limitations are provided as an alternate: The limitations for Iron (T), Chromium (T), and Nickel (T) are the same as specified in § 415.225(c).
