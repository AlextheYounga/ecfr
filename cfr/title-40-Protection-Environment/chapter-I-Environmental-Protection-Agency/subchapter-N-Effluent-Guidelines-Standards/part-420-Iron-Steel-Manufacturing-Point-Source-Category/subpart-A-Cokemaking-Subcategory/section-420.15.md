##### § 420.15 Pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES). #####

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and must achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES):

(a) *By-product cokemaking.*

(1) Increased loadings, not to exceed 13.3 per cent of the above limitations, shall be provided for process wastewaters from wet coke oven gas desulfurization systems, but only to the extent such systems generate process wastewaters.

(2) Increased loadings shall be provided for process wastewaters from other wet air pollution control systems (except those from coal charging and coke pushing emission controls), coal tar processing operations and coke plant groundwater remediation systems, but only to the extent such systems generate process wastewaters and those wastewaters are co-treated with process wastewaters from by-product cokemaking wastewaters.

(3) Increased loadings, not to exceed 44.2 percent of the above limitations, shall be provided for water used for the optimization of coke plant biological treatment systems.

(b) *Cokemaking—non-recovery.* There shall be no discharge of process wastewater pollutants to POTWs.
