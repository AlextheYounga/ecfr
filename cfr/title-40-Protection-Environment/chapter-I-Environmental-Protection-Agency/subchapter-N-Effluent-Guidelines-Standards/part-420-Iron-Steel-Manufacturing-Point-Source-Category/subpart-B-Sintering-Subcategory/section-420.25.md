##### ยง 420.25 Pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES). #####

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7 and 403.13, any existing source subject to this subpart that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and must achieve the following pretreatment standards for existing sources (PSES):

(a) Sintering operations with wet air pollution control system. The following table presents PSES for sintering operations with wet air pollution control systems:
