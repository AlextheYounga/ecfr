##### ยง 420.26 Pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS). #####

Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, any new source subject to this subpart that introduces pollutants into a publicly owned treatment works must comply with 40 CFR part 403 and must achieve the following pretreatment standards for new sources (PSNS), as applicable.

(a) Sintering operations with wet air pollution control system.

(1) Any new source subject to the provisions of this section that commenced discharging after November 18, 1992 and before November 18, 2002 must continue to achieve the standards specified in ยง 420.26 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, revised as of July 1, 2001, for ten years beginning on the date the source commenced discharge or during the period of depreciation or amortization of the facility, whichever comes first, after which the source must also achieve the pretreatment standard for 2,3,7,8-TCDF specified in ยง 420.25.

(2) Except as provided in 40 CFR 403.7, the following standards apply with respect to each new source that commences construction after November 18, 2002: The following table presents PSNS for sintering operations with wet air pollution control systems:
