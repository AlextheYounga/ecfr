##### § 282.61 Hawaii State-Administered Program. #####

(a) The State of Hawaii's underground storage tank program is approved in lieu of the Federal program in accordance with Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 *et seq.* The State's program, as administered by the Hawaii Department of Health, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this chapter. EPA approved the Hawaii underground storage tank program on September 25, 2002, and approval was effective on September 30, 2002.

(b) Hawaii has primary responsibility for enforcing its underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities in accordance with sections 9005 and 9006 of Subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, regardless of whether the State has taken its own actions, as well as in accordance with other statutory and regulatory provisions.

(c) To retain program approval, Hawaii must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the Federal Subtitle I program that make it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Hawaii obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the Federal Register.

(d) Hawaii has final approval for the following elements submitted to EPA in the State's program application for final approval. On September 25, 2002, EPA published a rule approving the State's program in the Federal Register, 67 FR 60161. That approval became effective on September 30, 2002. Copies of Hawaii's program application may be obtained from the Hawaii Department of Health, Solid and Hazardous Waste Branch, 919 Ala Moana Boulevard, Suite 212, Honolulu, HI 96814.
