##### § 282.77 Nebraska State-Administered Program. #####

(a) *History of the approval of Nebraska's program.* The State of Nebraska is approved to administer and enforce an underground storage tank program in lieu of the Federal program under Subtitle I of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6991 *et seq.* The State program, as administered by the Nebraska State Fire Marshal, was approved by EPA pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 6991c and part 281 of this Chapter. EPA approved the Nebraska program on August 19, 2002, and it was effective on September 18, 2002. A subsequent program revision application was approved by EPA and became effective on February 7, 2025.

(b) *Enforcement authority.* Nebraska has primary responsibility for administering and enforcing its federally approved underground storage tank program. However, EPA retains the authority to exercise its inspection and enforcement authorities under sections 9005 and 9006 of Subtitle I of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, as well as under any other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.

(c) *Retaining program approval.* To retain program approval, Nebraska must revise its approved program to adopt new changes to the federal Subtitle I program which makes it more stringent, in accordance with section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c and 40 CFR part 281, subpart E. If Nebraska obtains approval for the revised requirements pursuant to section 9004 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6991c, the newly approved statutory and regulatory provisions will be added to this subpart and notice of any change will be published in the Federal Register.

(d) *Final program approval.* Nebraska has final approval for the following elements of its program application originally submitted to EPA and approved on August 19, 2002 and effective September 18, 2002, and the program revision application approved by EPA, effective on February 7, 2025:
