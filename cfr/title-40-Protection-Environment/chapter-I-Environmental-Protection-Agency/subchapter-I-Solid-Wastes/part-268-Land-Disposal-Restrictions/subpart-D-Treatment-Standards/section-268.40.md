##### § 268.40 Applicability of treatment standards. #####

(a) A prohibited waste identified in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” may be land disposed only if it meets the requirements found in the table. For each waste, the table identifies one of three types of treatment standard requirements:

(1) All hazardous constituents in the waste or in the treatment residue must be at or below the values found in the table for that waste (“total waste standards”); or

(2) The hazardous constituents in the extract of the waste or in the extract of the treatment residue must be at or below the values found in the table (“waste extract standards”); or

(3) The waste must be treated using the technology specified in the table (“technology standard”), which are described in detail in § 268.42, Table 1—Technology Codes and Description of Technology-Based Standards.

(b) For wastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on maximums for any one day, except for D004 through D011 wastes for which the previously promulgated treatment standards based on grab samples remain in effect. For all nonwastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on grab sampling. For wastes covered by the waste extract standards, the test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,” EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11, must be used to measure compliance. An exception is made for D004 and D008, for which either of two test methods may be used: Method 1311, or Method 1310B, the Extraction Procedure Toxicity Test. For wastes covered by a technology standard, the wastes may be land disposed after being treated using that specified technology or an equivalent treatment technology approved by the Administrator under the procedures set forth in § 268.42(b).

(c) When wastes with differing treatment standards for a constituent of concern are combined for purposes of treatment, the treatment residue must meet the lowest treatment standard for the constituent of concern.

(d) Notwithstanding the prohibitions specified in paragraph (a) of this section, treatment and disposal facilities may demonstrate (and certify pursuant to 40 CFR 268.7(b)(5)) compliance with the treatment standards for organic constituents specified by a footnote in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, provided the following conditions are satisfied:

(1) The treatment standards for the organic constituents were established based on incineration in units operated in accordance with the technical requirements of 40 CFR part 264, subpart O, or based on combustion in fuel substitution units operating in accordance with applicable technical requirements;

(2) The treatment or disposal facility has used the methods referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to treat the organic constituents; and

(3) The treatment or disposal facility may demonstrate compliance with organic constituents if good-faith analytical efforts achieve detection limits for the regulated organic constituents that do not exceed the treatment standards specified in this section by an order of magnitude.

(e) For characteristic wastes (D001-D043) that are subject to treatment standards in the following table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes,” and are not managed in a wastewater treatment system that is regulated under the Clean Water Act (CWA), that is CWA-equivalent, or that is injected into a Class I nonhazardous deep injection well, all underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in § 268.2(i)) must meet Universal Treatment Standards, found in § 268.48, Table Universal Treatment Standards, prior to land disposal as defined in § 268.2(c) of this part.

(f) The treatment standards for F001-F005 nonwastewater constituents carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol apply to wastes which contain only one, two, or three of these constituents. Compliance is measured for these constituents in the waste extract from test Method 1311, the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure found in “Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods”, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in § 260.11. If the waste contains any of these three constituents along with any of the other 25 constituents found in F001-F005, then compliance with treatment standards for carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol are not required.

(g) Between August 26, 1996 and March 4, 1999 the treatment standards for the wastes specified in 40 CFR 261.32 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers K156-K161; and in 40 CFR 261.33 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers P127, P128, P185, P188-P192, P194, P196-P199, P201-P205, U271, U277-U280, U364-U367, U372, U373, U375-U379, U381-U387, U389-U396, U400-U404, U407, and U409-U411; and soil contaminated with these wastes; may be satisfied by either meeting the constituent concentrations presented in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, or by treating the waste by the following technologies: combustion, as defined by the technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1, for nonwastewaters; and, biodegradation as defined by the technology code BIODG, carbon adsorption as defined by the technology code CARBN, chemical oxidation as defined by the technology code CHOXD, or combustion as defined as technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1, for wastewaters.

(h) Prohibited D004-D011 mixed radioactive wastes and mixed radioactive listed wastes containing metal constituents, that were previously treated by stabilization to the treatment standards in effect at that time and then put into storage, do not have to be re-treated to meet treatment standards in this section prior to land disposal.

(i) [Reserved]

(j) Effective September 4, 1998, the treatment standards for the wastes specified in 40 CFR 261.33 as EPA Hazardous Waste numbers P185, P191, P192, P197, U364, U394, and U395 may be satisfied by either meeting the constituent concentrations presented in the table “Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes” in this section, or by treating the waste by the following technologies: combustion, as defined by the technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1 of this Part, for nonwastewaters; and, biodegradation as defined by the technology code BIODG, carbon adsorption as defined by the technology code CARBN, chemical oxidation as defined by the technology code CHOXD, or combustion as defined as technology code CMBST at § 268.42 Table 1 of this Part, for wastewaters.

Sludge generated in stormwater units that do not receive dry weather flow, sludges generated from non-contact once-through cooling waters segregated for treatment from other process or oily cooling waters, sludges generated in aggressive biological treatment units as defined in § 261.31(b)(2) (including sludges generated in one or more additional units after wastewaters have been treated in aggressive biological treatment units) and K051 wastes are not included in this listing.                                    |                    Acenaphthene  <br/>Anthracene  <br/>Benzene  <br/>Benz(a)anthracene  <br/>Benzo(a)pyrene  <br/>bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate  <br/>Chrysene  <br/>Di-n-butyl phthalate  <br/>Ethylbenzene  <br/>Fluorene  <br/>Naphthalene  <br/>Phenanthrene  <br/>Phenol  <br/>Pyrene  <br/>Toluene  <br/>Xylenes-mixed isomers (sum of o, m-, and p-xylene concentrations)                     |    83-32-9  <br/>120-12-7  <br/>71-43-2  <br/>56-55-3  <br/>50-32-8  <br/>117-81-7  <br/>218-01-9  <br/>84-74-2  <br/>100-41-4  <br/>86-73-7  <br/>91-20-3  <br/>85-01-8  <br/>108-95-2  <br/>129-00-0  <br/>108-88-3  <br/>1330-20-7    |           0.059  <br/>0.059  <br/>0.14  <br/>0.059  <br/>0.061  <br/>0.28  <br/>0.059  <br/>0.057  <br/>0.057  <br/>0.059  <br/>0.059  <br/>0.059  <br/>0.039  <br/>0.067  <br/>0.080  <br/>0.32           |                 NA  <br/>3.4  <br/>10  <br/>3.4  <br/>3.4  <br/>28  <br/>3.4  <br/>28  <br/>10  <br/>NA  <br/>5.6  <br/>5.6  <br/>6.2  <br/>8.2  <br/>10  <br/>30                 |
