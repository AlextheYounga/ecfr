If the Director approves, with or without changes, or denies the modification request during the term of the temporary or automatic authorization provided for in paragraphs (b)(6) (i), (ii), or (iii) of this section, such action cancels the temporary or automatic authorization.

(iv)(A) In the case of an automatic authorization under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of this section, or a temporary authorization under paragraph (b)(6) (i)(D) or (ii)(D) of this section, if the Director has not made a final approval or denial of the modification request by the date 50 days prior to the end of the temporary or automatic authorization, the permittee must within seven days of that time send a notification to persons on the facility mailing list, and make a reasonable effort to notify other persons who submitted written comments on the modification request, that:

The activities authorized under this paragraph must be conducted as described in the permit modification request and must be in compliance with all appropriate standards of 40 CFR part 265.

If the permittee requests that the modification be classified as a Class 1 or 2 modification, he or she must provide the Agency with the necessary information to support the requested classification.

(2) The Director shall make the determination described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section as promptly as practicable. In determining the appropriate class for a specific modification, the Director shall consider the similarity of the modification to other modifications codified in appendix I and the following criteria:

(B) Technological advancements, and

(C) Changes necessary to comply with new regulations, where these changes can be implemented without substantially changing design specifications or management practices in the permit.

(ii) The temporary authorization request must include:

(A) A description of the activities to be conducted under the temporary authorization;

(B) An explanation of why the temporary authorization is necessary; and

(C) Sufficient information to ensure compliance with 40 CFR part 264 standards.

(iii) The permittee must send a notice about the temporary authorization request to all persons on the facility mailing list maintained by the Director and to appropriate units of State and local governments as specified in 40 CFR 124.10(c)(ix). This notification must be made within seven days of submission of the authorization request.

(3) The Director shall approve or deny the temporary authorization as quickly as practical. To issue a temporary authorization, the Director must find:

The Director shall also notify such persons within 10 days after an automatic authorization for a Class 2 modification goes into effect under § 270.42(b)(6) (iii) or (v).

(2) The Director's decision to grant or deny a Class 2 or 3 permit modification request under this section may be appealed under the permit appeal procedures of 40 CFR 124.19.

(3) An automatic authorization that goes into effect under paragraph (b)(6)(iii) or (v) of this section may be appealed under the permit appeal procedures of 40 CFR 124.19; however, the permittee may continue to conduct the activities pursuant to the automatic authorization unless and until a final determination is made by the Environmental Appeals Board to grant review and remand the permit decision.

(g) *Newly regulated wastes and units.* (1) The permittee is authorized to continue to manage wastes listed or identified as hazardous under part 261 of this chapter, or to continue to manage hazardous waste in units newly regulated as hazardous waste management units, if:

If the owner or operator fails to certify compliance with all these requirements, he or she will lose authority to operate under this section.

(2) New wastes or units added to a facility's permit under this subsection do not constitute expansions for the purpose of the 25 percent capacity expansion limit for Class 2 modifications.

(h) *Military hazardous waste munitions treatment and disposal.* The permittee is authorized to continue to accept waste military munitions notwithstanding any permit conditions barring the permittee from accepting off-site wastes, if:
