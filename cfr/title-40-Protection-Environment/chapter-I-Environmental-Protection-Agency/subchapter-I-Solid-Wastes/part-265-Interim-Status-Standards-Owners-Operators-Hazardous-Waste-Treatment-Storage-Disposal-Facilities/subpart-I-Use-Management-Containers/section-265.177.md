##### ยง 265.177 Special requirements for incompatible wastes. #####

(a) Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials, (see appendix V for examples) must not be placed in the same container, unless ยง 265.17(b) is complied with.

(b) Hazardous waste must not be placed in an unwashed container that previously held an incompatible waste or material (see appendix V for examples), unless ยง 265.17(b) is complied with.

(c) A storage container holding a hazardous waste that is incompatible with any waste or other materials stored nearby in other containers, piles, open tanks, or surface impoundments must be separated from the other materials or protected from them by means of a dike, berm, wall, or other device.

[*Comment:* The purpose of this is to prevent fires, explosions, gaseous emissions, leaching, or other discharge of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could result from the mixing of incompatible wastes or materials if containers break or leak.]
