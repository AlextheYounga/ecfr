(1) Chemically treat a hazardous waste which is substantially different from waste previously treated in that impoundment; or

(2) Chemically treat hazardous waste with a substantially different process than any previously used in that impoundment; the owner or operator must, before treating the different waste or using the different process:

(i) Conduct waste analyses and trial treatment tests (e.g., bench scale or pilot plant scale tests); or

(ii) Obtain written, documented information on similar treatment of similar waste under similar operating conditions; to show that this treatment will comply with § 265.17(b).
