(a) In addition to the waste analysis required by § 265.13, whenever:

(1) A hazardous waste which is substantially different from waste previously treated in a treatment process or equipment at the facility is to be treated in that process or equipment, or

(2) A substantially different process than any previously used at the facility is to be used to chemically treat hazardous waste;

the owner or operator must, before treating the different waste or using the different process or equipment:

(i) Conduct waste analyses and trial treatment tests (e.g., bench scale or pilot plant scale tests); or

(ii) Obtain written, documented information on similar treatment of similar waste under similar operating conditions;

to show that this proposed treatment will meet all applicable requirements of § 265.401 (a) and (b).
