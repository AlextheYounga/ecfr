(2) *Bird hazard* means an increase in the likelihood of bird/aircraft collisions that may cause damage to the aircraft or injury to its occupants.

Note to § 258.10:

A prohibition on locating a new MSWLF near certain airports was enacted in Section 503 of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Ford Act), Pub. L. 106-181 (49 U.S.C. 44718 note). Section 503 prohibits the “construction or establishment” of new MSWLFs after April 5, 2000 within six miles of certain smaller public airports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) administers the Ford Act and has issued guidance in FAA Advisory Circular 150/5200-34, dated August 26, 2000. For further information, please contact the FAA.
