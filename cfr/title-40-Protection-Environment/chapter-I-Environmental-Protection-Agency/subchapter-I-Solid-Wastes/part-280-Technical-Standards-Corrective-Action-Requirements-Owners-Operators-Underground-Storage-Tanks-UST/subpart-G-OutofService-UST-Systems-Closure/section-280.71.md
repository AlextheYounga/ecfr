##### § 280.71 Permanent closure and changes-in-service. #####

(a) At least 30 days before beginning either permanent closure or a change-in-service under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, or within another reasonable time period determined by the implementing agency, owners and operators must notify the implementing agency of their intent to permanently close or make the change-in-service, *unless* such action is in response to corrective action. The required assessment of the excavation zone under § 280.72 must be performed after notifying the implementing agency but before completion of the permanent closure or a change-in-service.

(b) To permanently close a tank, owners and operators must empty and clean it by removing all liquids and accumulated sludges. All tanks taken out of service permanently must: be removed from the ground, filled with an inert solid material, or closed in place in a manner approved by the implementing agency.

(c) Continued use of an UST system to store a non-regulated substance is considered a change-in-service. Before a change-in-service, owners and operators must empty and clean the tank by removing all liquid and accumulated sludge and conduct a site assessment in accordance with § 280.72.
