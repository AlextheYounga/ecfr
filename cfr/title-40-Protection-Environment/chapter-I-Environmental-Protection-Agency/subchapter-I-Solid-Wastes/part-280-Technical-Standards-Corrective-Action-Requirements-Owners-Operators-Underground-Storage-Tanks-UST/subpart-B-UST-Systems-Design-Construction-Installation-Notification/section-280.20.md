##### § 280.20 Performance standards for new UST systems. #####

In order to prevent releases due to structural failure, corrosion, or spills and overfills for as long as the UST system is used to store regulated substances, all owners and operators of new UST systems must meet the following requirements. In addition, except for suction piping that meets the requirements of § 280.41(b)(1)(ii)(A) through (E), tanks and piping installed or replaced after April 11, 2016 must be secondarily contained and use interstitial monitoring in accordance with § 280.43(g). Secondary containment must be able to contain regulated substances leaked from the primary containment until they are detected and removed and prevent the release of regulated substances to the environment at any time during the operational life of the UST system. For cases where the piping is considered to be replaced, the entire piping run must be secondarily contained.
