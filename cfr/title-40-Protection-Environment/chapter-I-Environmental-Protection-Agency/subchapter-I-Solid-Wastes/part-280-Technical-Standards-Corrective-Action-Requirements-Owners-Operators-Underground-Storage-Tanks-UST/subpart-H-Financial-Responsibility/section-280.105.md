(2) The local government's year-end financial statements, if independently audited, cannot include an adverse auditor's opinion or a disclaimer of opinion. The local government cannot have outstanding issues of general obligation or revenue bonds that are rated as less than investment grade.

(3) The local government owner or operator must have a letter signed by the chief financial officer worded as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.
