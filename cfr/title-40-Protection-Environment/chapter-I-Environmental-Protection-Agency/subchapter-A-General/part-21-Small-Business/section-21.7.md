##### ยง 21.7 [Reserved] #####

Comment: Applications for a statement resulting from a requirement to control pollution from non-point sources as identified in section 304(e)(2)(A-F) of the Act and described in ยง 21.2(m) will not presently be issued a statement under ยง 21.5 unless the requirement is established through a permit under section 402. There is no requirement under the current Act that the Federal Government control pollution from such sources, and the nature and scope of State or areawide management agency proposals or programs to control such sources cannot be determined at this time. As State and areawide plans for control of nonpoint sources being prepared under section 208 of the Act, will not be completed for several years, this section is being reserved pending a future determination on the eligibility of applications relating to non-profit sources to receive a statement under this part.
