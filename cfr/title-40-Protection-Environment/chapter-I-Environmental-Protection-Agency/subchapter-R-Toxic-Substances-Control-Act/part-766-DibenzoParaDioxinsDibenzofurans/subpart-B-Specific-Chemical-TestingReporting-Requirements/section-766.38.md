##### ยง 766.38 Reporting on precursor chemical substances. #####

(a) *Identification of precursor chemical substances.* Precursor chemical substances are produced under conditions that will not yield HDDs and HDFs, but their molecular structure is conducive to HDD/HDF formation under favorable reaction conditions when they are used to produce other chemicals or products. The following precursor chemical substances are identified by Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and name.

(b) *Persons required to report.* All persons who manufacture or import a chemical product produced using any of the chemical substances listed in paragraph (a) of this section as feedstocks or intermediates must report no later than September 29, 1987. Small manufacturers and those manufacturers and importers who produce the precursor chemical substances in quantities of 100 kilograms or less per year only for research and development purposes are not required to report under this section

(c) *Data to be reported.* Manufacturers and importers of chemical products made from precursor chemical substances identified in paragraph (a) of this section must report process and reaction condition data on Part II of EPA Form 7710-51 for each chemical product. A separate EPA Form 7710-51 must be submitted for each chemical product reported, and the precursor chemical substance used must be identified. All forms must be submitted to EPA no later than September 29, 1987.
