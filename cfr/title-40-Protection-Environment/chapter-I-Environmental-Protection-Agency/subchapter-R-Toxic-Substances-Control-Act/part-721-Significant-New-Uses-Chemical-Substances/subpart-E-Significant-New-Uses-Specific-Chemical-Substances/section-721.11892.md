##### § 721.11892 Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (generic). #####

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance identified generically as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (PMN P-21-216) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been completely reacted (cured), entrained in a polymer, or incorporated into an article.

(2) The significant new uses are:

(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1) and (3) through (5) and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 1,000 if the capture and reduction rate is at least 99.5% but not 99.975% or greater, or at least 50 if the capture and reduction rate is at least 99.975%.

(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), and (g)(1), (3), and (5). For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1), this substance may cause: eye irritation; skin irritation; respiratory sensitization; skin sensitization; genetic toxicity; reproductive toxicity; carcinogenicity; specific target organ toxicity. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(3), this substance may be: toxic to aquatic life. Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.

(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(f). It is a significant new use to manufacture the substance to contain the confidential impurity listed in the Order at greater than 1% (by weight). It is a significant new use to process or use the substance other than for the confidential use allowed in the Order. It is a significant new use to process or use the substance other than in application methods that do not generate a vapor, mist, dust, or aerosol, unless such application method occurs in an enclosed process.

(iv) *Disposal.* Requirements as specified in § 721.85 (a)(1) and (2), (b)(1) and (2), and (c)(1) and (2). It is a significant new use to release the substance directly, whether by point (stack) or non-point (fugitive) sources, to air.

(v) *Release to water.* Requirements as specified in § 721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), and (c)(1).

(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).

(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (k) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.

(2) *Limitation or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
