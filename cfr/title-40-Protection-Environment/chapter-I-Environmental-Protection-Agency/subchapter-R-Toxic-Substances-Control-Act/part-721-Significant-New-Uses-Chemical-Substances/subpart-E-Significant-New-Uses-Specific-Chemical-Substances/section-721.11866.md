##### § 721.11866 Alkanoic acid, hydroxy-(hydroxyalkyl)-alkyl-, polymer with .alpha.-[(hydroxyalkyl)alkyl]-.omega.-alkoxypoly(oxy-alkanediyl), (haloalkyl)oxiane polymer (alkylalkylidene)bis[hydroxy-carbomonocycle] alkenoate and isocyanate-alkyl-carbomonocycle, hydroxyalkyl acrylate-blocked (generic). #####

(a) *Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to reporting.* (1) The chemical substance generically identified as alkanoic acid, hydroxy-(hydroxyalkyl)-alkyl-, polymer with .alpha.-[(hydroxyalkyl)alkyl]-.omega.-alkoxypoly(oxy-alkanediyl), (haloalkyl)oxiane polymer (alkylalkylidene)bis[hydroxy-carbomonocycle] alkenoate and isocyanate-alkyl-carbomonocycle, hydroxyalkyl acrylate-blocked (PMN P-20-101) is subject to reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. The requirements of this section do not apply to quantities of the substance after they have been completely cured.

(2) The significant new uses are:

(i) *Protection in the workplace.* Requirements as specified in § 721.63(a)(1) and (3) through (5) and (c). When determining which persons are reasonably likely to be exposed as required for § 721.63(a)(1) and (4), engineering control measures (*e.g.,* enclosure or confinement of the operation, general and local ventilation) or administrative control measures (*e.g.,* workplace policies and procedures) shall be considered and implemented to prevent exposure, where feasible. For purposes of § 721.63(a)(5), respirators must provide a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) assigned protection factor (APF) of at least 50.

(ii) *Hazard communication.* Requirements as specified in § 721.72(a) through (d), (f), and (g)(1), (3), and (5). For purposes of § 721.72(g)(1), this substance may cause: acute toxicity; skin irritation; eye irritation; respiratory sensitization; skin sensitization; reproductive toxicity; specific target organ toxicity. For purposes of § 721.72(g)(3), this substance may be: toxic to aquatic life. Alternative hazard and warning statements that meet the criteria of the Globally Harmonized System and OSHA Hazard Communication Standard may be used.

(iii) *Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.* Requirements as specified in § 721.80(o). It is a significant new use to manufacture or process the substance with greater than 20% (by weight) oligomer content below 1,000 daltons (*i.e.,* low molecular weight species). It is a significant new use to use the substance in a manual spray application.

(b) *Specific requirements.* The provisions of subpart A of this part apply to this section except as modified by this paragraph (b).

(1) *Recordkeeping.* Recordkeeping requirements as specified in § 721.125(a) through (i) are applicable to manufacturers, importers, and processors of this substance.

(2) *Limitation or revocation of certain notification requirements.* The provisions of § 721.185 apply to this section.
