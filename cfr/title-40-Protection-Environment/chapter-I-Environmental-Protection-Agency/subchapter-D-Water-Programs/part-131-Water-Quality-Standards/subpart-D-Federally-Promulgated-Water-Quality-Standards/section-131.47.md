|<sup>2</sup> These criteria are based on aluminum toxicity studies where aluminum was analyzed using total recoverable analytical methods. Oregon may utilize total recoverable analytical methods to implement the criteria. For characterizing ambient waters, Oregon may also utilize, as scientifically appropriate and as allowable by State and Federal regulations, analytical methods that measure the bioavailable fraction of aluminum (e.g., utilizing a less aggressive initial acid digestion, such as to a pH of approximately 4 or lower, that includes the measurement of amorphous aluminum hydroxide yet minimizes the measurement of mineralized forms of aluminum such as aluminum silicates associated with suspended sediment particles or clays).

(c) *Applicability.* (1) The criteria in paragraph (b) of this section are the applicable acute and chronic aluminum aquatic life criteria in all fresh waters in Oregon that are jurisdictional under the Clean Water Act to protect the fish and aquatic life designated uses.

(2) The criteria established in this section are subject to Oregon's general rules of applicability in the same way and to the same extent as are other federally promulgated and state-adopted numeric criteria when applied to fresh waters in Oregon that are jurisdictional under the Clean Water Act to protect the fish and aquatic life designated uses.

(3) For all waters with mixing zone regulations or implementation procedures, the criteria apply at the appropriate locations within or at the boundary of the mixing zones and outside of the mixing zones; otherwise the criteria apply throughout the water body including at the end of any discharge pipe, conveyance, or other discharge point within the water body.
