##### § 131.37 California. #####

(a) *Additional criteria.* The following criteria are applicable to waters specified in the Water Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary, adopted by the California State Water Resources Control Board in State Board Resolution No. 91-34 on May 1, 1991:

(1) *Estuarine habitat criteria.* (i) *General rule.* (A) Salinity (measured at the surface) shall not exceed 2640 micromhos/centimeter specific conductance at 25 °C (measured as a 14-day moving average) at the Confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers throughout the period each year from February 1 through June 30, and shall not exceed 2640 micromhos/centimeter specific conductance at 25 °C (measured as a 14-day moving average) at the specific locations noted in Table 1 near Roe Island and Chipps Island for the number of days each month in the February 1 to June 30 period computed by reference to the following formula:

Number of days required in Month X = Total number of days in Month × \* (1 − 1/(1 + eK) whereK = A + (B\*natural logarithm of the previous month's 8-River Index); A and B are determined by reference to Table 1 for the Roe Island and Chipps Island locations; x is the calendar month in the February 1 to June 30 period; and e is the base of the natural (or Napierian) logarithm.Where the number of days computed in this equation in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section shall be rounded to the nearest whole number of days. When the previous month's 8-River Index is less than 500,000 acre-feet, the number of days required for the current month shall be zero.

|<sup>1</sup> Coefficients for A and B are not provided at Chipps Island for February, because the 2640 micromhos/cm specific conductance criteria must be maintained at Chipps Island throughout February under all historical 8-River Index values for January.|             |                         |       |         |

(B) The Roe Island criteria apply at the salinity measuring station maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation at Port Chicago (km 64). The Chipps Island criteria apply at the Mallard Slough Monitoring Site, Station D-10 (RKI RSAC-075) maintained by the California Department of Water Resources. The Confluence criteria apply at the Collinsville Continuous Monitoring Station C-2 (RKI RSAC-081) maintained by the California Department of Water Resources.

(ii) *Exception.* The criteria at Roe Island shall be required for any given month only if the 14-day moving average salinity at Roe Island falls below 2640 micromhos/centimeter specific conductance on any of the last 14 days of the previous month.

(2) *Fish migration criteria*—(i) *General rule*—(A) *Sacramento River.* Measured Fish Migration criteria values for the Sacramento River shall be at least the following:

At temperatures less than below 61 °F: SRFMC = 1.35 At temperatures between 61 °F and 72 °F: SRFMC = 6.96-.092 \* Fahrenheit temperature At temperatures greater than 72 °F: SRFMC = 0.34 where SRFMC is the Sacramento River Fish Migration criteria value. Temperature shall be the water temperature at release of tagged salmon smolts into the Sacramento River at Miller Park.

(B) *San Joaquin River.* Measured Fish Migration criteria values on the San Joaquin River shall be at least the following:

For years in which the SJVIndex is \>2.5: SJFMC = (−0.012) + 0.184\*SJVIndex In other years: SJFMC = 0.205 + 0.0975\*SJVIndex where SJFMC is the San Joaquin River Fish Migration criteria value, and SJVIndex is the San Joaquin Valley Index in million acre feet (MAF)

(ii) *Computing fish migration criteria values for Sacramento River.* In order to assess fish migration criteria values for the Sacramento River, tagged fall-run salmon smolts will be released into the Sacramento River at Miller Park and captured at Chipps Island, or alternatively released at Miller Park and Port Chicago and recovered from the ocean fishery, using the methodology described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii). An alternative methodology for computing fish migration criteria values can be used so long as the revised methodology is calibrated with the methodology described in this paragraph (a)(2)(ii) so as to maintain the validity of the relative index values. Sufficient releases shall be made each year to provide a statistically reliable verification of compliance with the criteria. These criteria will be considered attained when the sum of the differences between the measured experimental value and the stated criteria value (i.e., measured value minus stated value) for each experimental release conducted over a three year period (the current year and the previous two years) shall be greater than or equal to zero. Fish for release are to be tagged at the hatchery with coded-wire tags, and fin clipped. Approximately 50,000 to 100,000 fish of smolt size (size greater than 75 mm) are released for each survival index estimate, depending on expected mortality. As a control for the ocean recovery survival index, one or two groups per season are released at Benecia or Pt. Chicago. From each upstream release of tagged fish, fish are to be caught over a period of one to two weeks at Chipps Island. Daylight sampling at Chipps Island with a 9.1 by 7.9 m, 3.2 mm cod end, midwater trawl is begun 2 to 3 days after release. When the first fish is caught, full-time trawling 7 days a week should begin. Each day's trawling consists of ten 20 minute tows generally made against the current, and distributed equally across the channel.

(A) The Chipps Island smolt survival index is calculated as:

SSI = R ÷ MT(0.007692)whereR = number of recaptures of tagged fishM = number of marked (tagged) fish releasedT = proportion of time sampled vs total time tagged fish were passing the site (i.e. time between first and last tagged fish recovery)Where the value 0.007692 is the proportion of the channel width fished by the trawl, and is calculated as trawl width/channel width.

(B) Recoveries of tagged fish from the ocean salmon fishery two to four years after release are also used to calculate a survival index for each release. Smolt survival indices from ocean recoveries are calculated as:

OSI = R1/M1 ÷ R2/M2whereR1 = number of tagged adults recovered from the upstream releaseM1 = number released upstreamR2 = number of tagged adults recovered from the Port Chicago releaseM2 = number released at Port Chicago

(*1*) The number of tagged adults recovered from the ocean fishery is provided by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, which maintains a port sampling program.

(*2*) [Reserved]

(iii) *Computing fish migration criteria values for San Joaquin River.* In order to assess annual fish migration criteria values for the San Joaquin River, tagged salmon smolts will be released into the San Joaquin River at Mossdale and captured at Chipps Island, or alternatively released at Mossdale and Port Chicago and recovered from the ocean fishery, using the methodology described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii). An alternative methodology for computing fish migration criteria values can be used so long as the revised methodology is calibrated with the methodology described below so as to maintain the validity of the relative index values. Sufficient releases shall be made each year to provide a statistically reliable estimate of the SJFMC for the year. These criteria will be considered attained when the sum of the differences between the measured experimental value and the stated criteria value (i.e., measured value minus stated value) for each experimental release conducted over a three year period (the current year and the previous two years) shall be greater than or equal to zero.

(A) Fish for release are to be tagged at the hatchery with coded-wire tags, and fin clipped. Approximately 50,000 to 100,000 fish of smolt size (size greater than 75 mm) are released for each survival index estimate, depending on expected mortality. As a control for the ocean recovery survival index, one or two groups per season are released at Benicia or Pt. Chicago. From each upstream release of tagged fish, fish are to be caught over a period of one to two weeks at Chipps Island.

When the first fish is caught, full-time trawling 7 days a week should begin. Each day's trawling consists of ten 20 minute tows generally made against the current, and distributed equally across the channel.

(B) The Chipps Island smolt survival index is calculated as:

SSI = R ÷ MT(0.007692)whereR = number of recaptures of tagged fishM = number of marked (tagged) fish releasedT = proportion of time sampled vs total time tagged fish were passing the site (i.e. time between first and last tagged fish recovery)Where the value 0.007692 is the proportion of the channel width fished by the trawl, and is calculated as trawl width/channel width.

(C) Recoveries of tagged fish from the ocean salmon fishery two to four years after release are also used to calculate a survival index for each release. Smolt survival indices from ocean recoveries are calculated as:

OSI = R1/M1 ÷ R2/M2whereR1 = number of tagged adults recovered from the upstream releaseM1 = number released upstreamR2 = number of tagged adults recovered from the Port Chicago releaseM2 = number released at Port Chicago

(*1*) The number of tagged adults recovered from the ocean fishery is provided by the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission, which maintains a port sampling program.

(*2*) [Reserved]

(3) *Suisun marsh criteria.* (i) Water quality conditions sufficient to support a natural gradient in species composition and wildlife habitat characteristic of a brackish marsh throughout all elevations of the tidal marshes bordering Suisun Bay shall be maintained. Water quality conditions shall be maintained so that none of the following occurs: Loss of diversity; conversion of brackish marsh to salt marsh; for animals, decreased population abundance of those species vulnerable to increased mortality and loss of habitat from increased water salinity; or for plants, significant reduction in stature or percent cover from increased water or soil salinity or other water quality parameters.

(ii) [Reserved]

(b) *Revised criteria.* The following criteria are applicable to state waters specified in Table 1-1, at Section (C)(3) (“Striped Bass—Salinity : 3. Prisoners Point—Spawning) of the Water Quality Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay—Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta Estuary, adopted by the California State Water Resources Control Board in State Board Resolution No. 91-34 on May 1, 1991:
