Footnotes

a. Criteria revised to reflect current agency q1\* or RfD, as contained in the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS). The fish tissue bioconcentration factor (BCF) from the 1980 criteria documents was retained in all cases.

b. The criteria refers to the inorganic form only.

c. Criteria in the matrix based on carcinogenicity (10−6 risk). For a risk level of 10−5, move the decimal point in the matrix value one place to the right.

d. Criteria Maximum Concentration (CMC) = the highest concentration of a pollutant to which aquatic life can be exposed for a short period of time (1-hour average) without deleterious effects. Criteria Continuous Concentration (CCC) = the highest concentration of a pollutant to which aquatic life can be exposed for an extended period of time (4 days) without deleterious effects. µg/L = micrograms per liter.

e. Freshwater aquatic life criteria for these metals are expressed as a function of total hardness (mg/L as CaCO3), the pollutant's water effect ratio (WER) as defined in § 131.36(c) and multiplied by an appropriate dissolved conversion factor as defined in § 131.36(b)(2). For comparative purposes, the values displayed in this matrix are shown as dissolved metal and correspond to a total hardness of 100 mg/L and a water effect ratio of 1.0.

f. Freshwater aquatic life criteria for pentachlorophenol are expressed as a function of pH, and are calculated as follows. Values displayed above in the matrix correspond to a pH of 7.8.

 CMC = exp(1.005(pH)−4.830) CCC = exp(1.005(pH)−5.290)

g. Aquatic life criteria for these compounds were issued in 1980 utilizing the 1980 Guidelines for criteria development. The acute values shown are final acute values (FAV) which by the 1980 Guidelines are instantaneous values as contrasted with a CMC which is a one-hour average.

h. These totals simply sum the criteria in each column. For aquatic life, there are 31 priority toxic pollutants with some type of freshwater or saltwater, acute or chronic criteria. For human health, there are 85 priority toxic pollutants with either “water + fish” or “fish only” criteria. Note that these totals count chromium as one pollutant even though EPA has developed criteria based on two valence states. In the matrix, EPA has assigned numbers 5a and 5b to the criteria for chromium to reflect the fact that the list of 126 priority toxic pollutants includes only a single listing for chromium.

i. If the CCC for total mercury exceeds 0.012 µg/l more than once in a 3-year period in the ambient water, the edible portion of aquatic species of concern must be analyzed to determine whether the concentration of methyl mercury exceeds the FDA action level (1.0 mg/kg). If the FDA action level is exceeded, the State must notify the appropriate EPA Regional Administrator, initiate a revision of its mercury criterion in its water quality standards so as to protect designated uses, and take other appropriate action such as issuance of a fish consumption advisory for the affected area.

j. No criteria for protection of human health from consumption of aquatic organisms (excluding water) was presented in the 1980 criteria document or in the 1986 Quality Criteria for Water. Nevertheless, sufficient information was presented in the 1980 document to allow a calculation of a criterion, even though the results of such a calculation were not shown in the document.

k. The criterion for asbestos is the MCL (56 FR 3526, January 30, 1991).

l. [Reserved: This letter not used as a footnote.]

m. Criteria for these metals are expressed as a function of the water effect ratio, WER, as defined in 40 CFR 131.36(c).

CMC = column B1 or C1 value × WERCCC = column B2 or C2 value × WER

n. EPA is not promulgating human health criteria for this contaminant. However, permit authorities should address this contaminant in NPDES permit actions using the State's existing narrative criteria for toxics.

o. [Reserved: This letter not used as a footnote.]

p. Criterion expressed as total recoverable.

q. This criterion applies to total PCBs (*e.g.,* the sum of all congener or isomer or homolog or Aroclor analyses).

General Notes

1. This chart lists all of EPA's priority toxic pollutants whether or not criteria recommendations are available. Blank spaces indicate the absence of criteria recommendations. Because of variations in chemical nomenclature systems, this listing of toxic pollutants does not duplicate the listing in Appendix A of 40 CFR Part 423. EPA has added the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry numbers, which provide a unique identification for each chemical.

2. The following chemicals have organoleptic based criteria recommendations that are not included on this chart (for reasons which are discussed in the preamble): copper, zinc, chlorobenzene, 2-chlorophenol, 2,4-dichlorophenol, acenaphthene, 2,4-dimethylphenol, 3-methyl-4-chlorophenol, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, pentachlorophenol, phenol.

3. For purposes of this rulemaking, freshwater criteria and saltwater criteria apply as specified in 40 CFR 131.36(c).

Note to paragraph (b)(1):

On April 14, 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a stay of certain criteria in paragraph (b)(1) of this section as follows: the criteria in columns B and C for arsenic, cadmium, chromium (VI), copper, lead, nickel, silver, and zinc; the criteria in B1 and C1 for mercury; the criteria in column B for chromium (III); and the criteria in column C for selenium. The stay remains in effect until further notice.

(2) Factors for Calculating Hardness-Dependent, Freshwater Metals Criteria

CMC = WER exp { mA[ln(hardness)] + bA} × Acute Conversion Factor CCC = WER exp { mC[ln(hardness)] + bC} × Chronic Conversion Factor Final CMC and CCC values should be rounded to two significant figures.

(2) The criteria established in this section are subject to the State's general rules of applicability in the same way and to the same extent as are the other numeric toxics criteria when applied to the same use classifications including mixing zones, and low flow values below which numeric standards can be exceeded in flowing fresh waters.

(i) For all waters with mixing zone regulations or implementation procedures, the criteria apply at the appropriate locations within or at the boundary of the mixing zones; otherwise the criteria apply throughout the waterbody including at the end of any discharge pipe, canal or other discharge point.

(ii) A State shall not use a low flow value below which numeric standards can be exceeded that is less stringent than the following for waters suitable for the establishment of low flow return frequencies (*i.e.*, streams and rivers):

It is determined by EPA's computerized method (DFLOW model); 30 Q 5 is the lowest average 30 consecutive day low flow with an average recurrence frequency of once in 5 years determined hydrologically; and the harmonic mean flow is a long term mean flow value calculated by dividing the number of daily flows analyzed by the sum of the reciprocals of those daily flows.

(iii) If a State does not have such a low flow value for numeric standards compliance, then none shall apply and the criteria included in paragraph (d) of this section herein apply at all flows.

(3) The aquatic life criteria in the matrix in paragraph (b) of this section apply as follows:

(i) For waters in which the salinity is equal to or less than 1 part per thousand 95% or more of the time, the applicable criteria are the freshwater criteria in Column B;

(ii) For waters in which the salinity is equal to or greater than 10 parts per thousand 95% or more of the time, the applicable criteria are the saltwater criteria in Column C; and

(iii) For waters in which the salinity is between 1 and 10 parts per thousand as defined in paragraphs (c)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section, the applicable criteria are the more stringent of the freshwater or saltwater criteria. However, the Regional Administrator may approve the use of the alternative freshwater or saltwater criteria if scientifically defensible information and data demonstrate that on a site-specific basis the biology of the waterbody is dominated by freshwater aquatic life and that freshwater criteria are more appropriate; or conversely, the biology of the waterbody is dominated by saltwater aquatic life and that saltwater criteria are more appropriate.

(4) *Application of metals criteria.* (i) For purposes of calculating freshwater aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the minimum hardness allowed for use in those equations shall not be less than 25 mg/l, as calcium carbonate, even if the actual ambient hardness is less than 25 mg/l as calcium carbonate. The maximum hardness value for use in those equations shall not exceed 400 mg/l as calcium carbonate, even if the actual ambient hardness is greater than 400 mg/l as calcium carbonate. The same provisions apply for calculating the metals criteria for the comparisons provided for in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.

(ii) The hardness values used shall be consistent with the design discharge conditions established in paragraph (c)(2) of this section for flows and mixing zones.

(iii) Except where otherwise noted, the criteria for metals (compounds #2, #4-# 11, and #13, in paragraph (b) of this section) are expressed as dissolved metal. For purposes of calculating aquatic life criteria for metals from the equations in footnote m. in the criteria matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the equations in paragraphs (b)(2) of this section, the water-effect ratio is computed as a specific pollutant's acute or chronic toxicity values measured in water from the site covered by the standard, divided by the respective acute or chronic toxicity value in laboratory dilution water.

(10) *California, EPA Region 9.* (i) All waters assigned any aquatic life or human health use classifications in the Water Quality Control Plans for the various Basins of the State (“Basin Plans”), as amended, adopted by the California State Water Resources Control Board (“SWRCB”), except for ocean waters covered by the Water Quality Control Plan for Ocean Waters of California (“Ocean Plan”) adopted by the SWRCB with resolution Number 90-27 on March 22, 1990, are subject to the criteria in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section, without exception. These criteria amend the portions of the existing State standards contained in the Basin Plans. More particularly these criteria amend water quality criteria contained in the Basin Plan Chapters specifying water quality objectives (the State equivalent of federal water quality criteria) for the toxic pollutants identified in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section. Although the State has adopted several use designations for each of these waters, for purposes of this action, the specific standards to be applied in paragraph (d)(10)(ii) of this section are based on the presence in all waters of some aquatic life designation and the presence or absence of the MUN use designation (Municipal and domestic supply). (See Basin Plans for more detailed use definitions.)

(ii) The following criteria from the matrix in paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply to the water and use classifications defined in paragraph (d)(10)(i) of this section and identified below:
