(b) *When is the special notice for failure to determine bin classification or mean Cryptosporidium level to be given?* The owner or operator of a community or non-community water system that is required to determine a bin classification under § 141.710, or to determine mean *Cryptosporidium* level under § 141.712, must notify persons served by the water system that the determination has not been made as required no later than 30 days after the system has failed report the determination as specified in § 141.710(e) or § 141.712(a), respectively.

(d) *What mandatory language must be contained in the special notice?* The notice must contain the following language, including the language necessary to fill in the blanks.

(1) The special notice for repeated failure to conduct monitoring must contain the following language:

We are required to monitor the source of your drinking water for *Cryptosporidium.* Results of the monitoring are to be used to determine whether water treatment at the (treatment plant name) is sufficient to adequately remove *Cryptosporidium* from your drinking water. We are required to complete this monitoring and make this determination by (required bin determination date). We “did not monitor or test” or “did not complete all monitoring or testing” on schedule and, therefore, we may not be able to determine by the required date what treatment modifications, if any, must be made to ensure adequate *Cryptosporidium* removal. Missing this deadline may, in turn, jeopardize our ability to have the required treatment modifications, if any, completed by the deadline required, (date).

For more information, please call (name of water system contact) of (name of water system) at (phone number).

(2) The special notice for failure to determine bin classification or mean *Cryptosporidium* level must contain the following language:

We are required to monitor the source of your drinking water for *Cryptosporidium* in order to determine by (date) whether water treatment at the (treatment plant name) is sufficient to adequately remove *Cryptosporidium* from your drinking water. We have not made this determination by the required date. Our failure to do this may jeopardize our ability to have the required treatment modifications, if any, completed by the required deadline of (date). For more information, please call (name of water system contact) of (name of water system) at (phone number).

(3) Each special notice must also include a description of what the system is doing to correct the violation and when the system expects to return to compliance or resolve the situation.
