##### § 141.62 Maximum contaminant levels for inorganic contaminants. #####

(a) [Reserved]

(b) The maximum contaminant levels for inorganic contaminants specified in paragraphs (b) (2)-(6), (b)(10), and (b) (11)-(16) of this section apply to community water systems and non-transient, non-community water systems. The maximum contaminant level specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section only applies to community water systems. The maximum contaminant levels specified in (b)(7), (b)(8), and (b)(9) of this section apply to community water systems; non-transient, non-community water systems; and transient non-community water systems.
