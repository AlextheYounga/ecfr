##### § 141.621 Routine monitoring. #####

(a) *Monitoring.* (1) If you submitted an IDSE report, you must begin monitoring at the locations and months you have recommended in your IDSE report submitted under § 141.605 following the schedule in § 141.620(c), unless the State requires other locations or additional locations after its review. If you submitted a 40/30 certification under § 141.603 or you qualified for a very small system waiver under § 141.604 or you are a nontransient noncommunity water system serving \<10,000, you must monitor at the location(s) and dates identified in your monitoring plan in § 141.132(f), updated as required by § 141.622.

(2) You must monitor at no fewer than the number of locations identified in this paragraph (a)(2).

|<sup>2</sup> Systems on quarterly monitoring must take dual sample sets every 90 days at each monitoring location, except for subpart H systems serving 500-3,300. Ground water systems serving 500-9,999 on annual monitoring must take dual sample sets at each monitoring location. All other systems on annual monitoring and subpart H systems serving 500-3,300 are required to take individual TTHM and HAA5 samples (instead of a dual sample set) at the locations with the highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations, respectively. For systems serving fewer than 500 people, only one location with a dual sample set per monitoring period is needed if the highest TTHM and HAA5 concentrations occur at the same location and month.|                        |                                 |                                                                                |

(3) If you are an undisinfected system that begins using a disinfectant other than UV light after the dates in subpart U of this part for complying with the Initial Distribution System Evaluation requirements, you must consult with the State to identify compliance monitoring locations for this subpart. You must then develop a monitoring plan under § 141.622 that includes those monitoring locations.

(b) *Analytical methods.* You must use an approved method listed in § 141.131 for TTHM and HAA5 analyses in this subpart. Analyses must be conducted by laboratories that have received certification by EPA or the State as specified in § 141.131.
