##### § 141.600 General requirements. #####

(a) The requirements of subpart U of this part constitute national primary drinking water regulations. The regulations in this subpart establish monitoring and other requirements for identifying subpart V compliance monitoring locations for determining compliance with maximum contaminant levels for total trihalomethanes (TTHM) and haloacetic acids (five)(HAA5). You must use an Initial Distribution System Evaluation (IDSE) to determine locations with representative high TTHM and HAA5 concentrations throughout your distribution system. IDSEs are used in conjunction with, but separate from, subpart L compliance monitoring, to identify and select subpart V compliance monitoring locations.

(b) *Applicability.* You are subject to these requirements if your system is a community water system that uses a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light or delivers water that has been treated with a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light; or if your system is a nontransient noncommunity water system that serves at least 10,000 people and uses a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light or delivers water that has been treated with a primary or residual disinfectant other than ultraviolet light.

(c) *Schedule.* (1) You must comply with the requirements of this subpart on the schedule in the table in this paragraph (c)(1).
