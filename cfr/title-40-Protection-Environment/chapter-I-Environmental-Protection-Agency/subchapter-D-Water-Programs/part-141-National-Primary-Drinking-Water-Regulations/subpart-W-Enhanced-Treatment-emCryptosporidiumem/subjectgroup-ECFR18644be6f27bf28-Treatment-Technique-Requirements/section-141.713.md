(d) If the bin classification for a filtered system changes following the second round of source water monitoring, as determined under § 141.710(d), the system must provide the level of treatment for *Cryptosporidium* required under § 141.711 on a schedule the State approves.

(e) If the mean *Cryptosporidium* level for an unfiltered system changes following the second round of monitoring, as determined under § 141.712(a)(2), and if the system must provide a different level of *Cryptosporidium* treatment under § 141.712 due to this change, the system must meet this treatment requirement on a schedule the State approves.
