(b)(1) Filtered systems must use one or more of the treatment and management options listed in § 141.715, termed the microbial toolbox, to comply with the additional *Cryptosporidium* treatment required in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) Systems classified in Bin 3 and Bin 4 must achieve at least 1-log of the additional *Cryptosporidium* treatment required under paragraph (a) of this section using either one or a combination of the following: bag filters, bank filtration, cartridge filters, chlorine dioxide, membranes, ozone, or UV, as described in §§ 141.716 through 141.720.

(c) Failure by a system in any month to achieve treatment credit by meeting criteria in §§ 141.716 through 141.720 for microbial toolbox options that is at least equal to the level of treatment required in paragraph (a) of this section is a violation of the treatment technique requirement.

(d) If the State determines during a sanitary survey or an equivalent source water assessment that after a system completed the monitoring conducted under § 141.701(a) or § 141.701(b), significant changes occurred in the system's watershed that could lead to increased contamination of the source water by *Cryptosporidium,* the system must take actions specified by the State to address the contamination. These actions may include additional source water monitoring and/or implementing microbial toolbox options listed in § 141.715.
