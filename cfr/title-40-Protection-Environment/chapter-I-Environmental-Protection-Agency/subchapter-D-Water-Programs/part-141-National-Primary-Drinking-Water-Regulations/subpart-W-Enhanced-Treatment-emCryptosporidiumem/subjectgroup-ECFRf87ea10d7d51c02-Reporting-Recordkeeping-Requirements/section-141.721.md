##### § 141.721 Reporting requirements. #####

(a) Systems must report sampling schedules under § 141.702 and source water monitoring results under § 141.706 unless they notify the State that they will not conduct source water monitoring due to meeting the criteria of § 141.701(d).

(b) Systems must report the use of uncovered finished water storage facilities to the State as described in § 141.714.

(c) Filtered systems must report their *Cryptosporidium* bin classification as described in § 141.710.

(d) Unfiltered systems must report their mean source water *Cryptosporidium* level as described in § 141.712.

(e) Systems must report disinfection profiles and benchmarks to the State as described in §§ 141.708 through 141.709 prior to making a significant change in disinfection practice.

(f) Systems must report to the State in accordance with the following table for any microbial toolbox options used to comply with treatment requirements under § 141.711 or § 141.712. Alternatively, the State may approve a system to certify operation within required parameters for treatment credit rather than reporting monthly operational data for toolbox options.
