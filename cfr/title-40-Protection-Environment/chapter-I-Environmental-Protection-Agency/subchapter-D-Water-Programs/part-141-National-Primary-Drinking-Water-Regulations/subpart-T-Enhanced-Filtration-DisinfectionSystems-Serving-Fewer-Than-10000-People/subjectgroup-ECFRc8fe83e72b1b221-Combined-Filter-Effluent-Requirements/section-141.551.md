##### § 141.551 What strengthened combined filter effluent turbidity limits must my system meet? #####

Your system must meet two strengthened combined filter effluent turbidity limits.

(a) The first combined filter effluent turbidity limit is a “95th percentile” turbidity limit that your system must meet in at least 95 percent of the turbidity measurements taken each month. Measurements must continue to be taken as described in § 141.74(a) and (c). Monthly reporting must be completed according to § 141.570. The following table describes the required limits for specific filtration technologies.

|      If your system consists of \* \* \*       |                            Your 95th percentile turbidity value is \* \* \*                            |
|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|(1) Conventional Filtration or Direct Filtration|                                                0.3 NTU.                                                |
|     (2) All other “Alternative” Filtration     |A value determined by the State (not to exceed 1 NTU) based on the demonstration described in § 141.552.|

(b) The second combined filter effluent turbidity limit is a “maximum” turbidity limit which your system may at no time exceed during the month. Measurements must continue to be taken as described in § 141.74(a) and (c). Monthly reporting must be completed according to § 141.570. The following table describes the required limits for specific filtration technologies.

|      If your system consists of \* \* \*       |                                 Your maximum turbidity value is \* \* \*                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|(1) Conventional Filtration or Direct Filtration|                                                  1 NTU.                                                   |
|     (2) All other “Alternative Filtration”     |A value determined by the State (not to exceed 5 NTU) based on the demonstration as described in § 141.552.|
