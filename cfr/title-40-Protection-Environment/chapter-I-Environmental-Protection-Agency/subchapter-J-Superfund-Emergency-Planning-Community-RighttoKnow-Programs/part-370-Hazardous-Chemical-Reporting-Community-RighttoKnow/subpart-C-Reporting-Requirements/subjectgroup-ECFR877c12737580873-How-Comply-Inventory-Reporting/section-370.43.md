Note to paragraph (a):

To convert gas or liquid volume to weight in pounds, multiply by an appropriate density factor.

(b) Your SERC or LEPC may provide other range codes for reporting maximum amount and average daily amount, or may require reporting of specific amounts. You may use your SERC's or LEPC's range codes (or specific amounts) provided the ranges are not broader than the ranges in paragraph (a) of this section.
