Tampering With Noise Control System Prohibited

Federal law prohibits the following acts or causing thereof:

(1) The removal or rendering inoperative by any person other than for purposes of maintenance, repair, or replacement, of any device or element of design incorporated into any new vehicle for the purpose of noise control prior to its sale or delivery to the ultimate purchaser or while it is in use, or (2) the use of the vehicle after such device or element of design has been removed or rendered inoperative by any person.

(2) The statement:

Among those acts presumed to constitute tampering are the acts listed below.

Immediately following this statement, the manufacturer must include the list developed under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Any act included in the list prepared pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is presumed to constitute tampering; however, in any case in which a presumed act of tampering has been committed and it can be shown that such act resulted in no increase in the noise level of the vehicle or that the vehicle still meets the noise emission standard of ยง 205.152, the act will not constitute tampering.

(d) The provisions of this section are not intended to preclude any State or local jurisdiction from adopting and enforcing its own prohibitions against the removal or rendering inoperative of noise control systems on vehicles subject to this part.
