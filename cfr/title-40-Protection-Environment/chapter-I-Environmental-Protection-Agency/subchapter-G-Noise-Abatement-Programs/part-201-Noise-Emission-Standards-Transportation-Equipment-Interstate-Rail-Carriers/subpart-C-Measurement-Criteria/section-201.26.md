##### § 201.26 Procedures for the measurement on receiving property of retarder and car coupling noise. #####

(a) *Retarders*—(1) *Microphone.* The microphone must be located on the receiving property and positioned at a height between 1.2 and 1.5 meters (4 to 5 feet) above the ground. The microphone must be positioned with respect to the equipment in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations for Type 1 or 2 performance as appropriate. No person may stand between the microphone and the equipment being measured or be otherwise positioned relative to the microphone at variance with the manufacturers' recommendations for Type 1 or 2 performance as appropriate.

(2) *Data.* The maximum A-weighted sound levels (FAST) for every retarder sound observed during the measurement period must be read from the indicator and recorded. At least 30 consecutive retarder sounds must be measured. The measurement period must be at least 60 minutes and not more than 240 minutes.

(3) *Adjusted average maximum A-weighted sound level.* The energy average level for the measured retarder sounds must be calculated to determine the value of the average maximum A-weighted sound level (Lave max). This value is then adjusted by adding the adjustment (C) from Table 2 appropriate to the number of measurements divided by the duration of the measurement period (n/T), to obtain the adjusted average maximum A-weighted sound level (Ladj ave max) for retarders.

(b) *Car coupling impact*—(1) *Microphone.* The microphone must be located on the receiving property and at a distance of at least 30 meters (100 feet) from the centerline of the nearest track on which car coupling occurs and its sound is measured (that is, either the microphone is located 30 meters (100 feet) from the nearest track on which couplings occur, or all sounds resulting from car coupling impacts that occur on tracks with centerlines located less than 30 meters (100 feet) from the microphone are disregarded). The microphone shall be positioned at a height between 1.2 and 1.5 meters (4 and 5 feet) above the ground, and it must be positioned with respect to the equipment in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations for Type 1 or 2 performance as appropriate. No person may stand between the microphone and the equipment being measured or be otherwise positioned relative to the microphone at variance with the manufacturers' recommendations for Type 1 or 2 performance as appropriate.

(2) *Data.* The maximum A-weighted sound levels (FAST) for every car coupling impact sound observed during the measurement period must be read from the indicator and recorded. At least 30 consecutive car coupling impact sounds must be measured. The measurement period must be at least 60 minutes and not more than 240 minutes, and must be reported.

|Values in Table 2 were calculated from [C = 10 log n/T] with intervals selected to round off values to the nearest whole decibel. The table may be extended or interpolated to finer interval gradations by using this defining equation.|    |

(3) *Adjusted average maximum A-weighted sound level.* The energy average level for the measured car coupling sounds is calculated to determine the average maximum sound level (Lave max). It is then adjusted by adding the adjustment (C) from Table 2 appropriate to the number of measurements divided by the duration of the measurement period (n/T), to obtain the adjusted average maximum A-weighted sound level (Ladj ave max) for car coupling impacts.
