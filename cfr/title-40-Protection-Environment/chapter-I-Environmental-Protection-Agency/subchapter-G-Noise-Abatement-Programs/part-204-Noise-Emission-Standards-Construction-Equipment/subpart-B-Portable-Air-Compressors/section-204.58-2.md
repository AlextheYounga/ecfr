(a) For each configuration of air compressors covered by this part, the manufacturer shall develop a list of those acts which, in his judgment, might be done to the air compressor in use and which would constitute the removal or rendering inoperative of noise control devices or elements of design of the compressor.

(b) The manufacturer shall include in the owner's manual the following information:

(1) The statement:

Tampering With Noise Control System Prohibited

Federal law prohibits the following acts or the causing thereof:

(1) The removal or rendering inoperative by any persons, other than for purposes of maintenance, repair, or replacement, of any devices or element of design incorporated into any new compressor for the purpose of noise control prior to its sale or delivery to the ultimate purchaser or while it is in use; or (2) the use of the compressor after such device or element of design has been removed or rendered inoperative by any person.

(2) The statement:

Among those acts included in the prohibition against tampering are the acts listed below.

Immediately following this statement, the manufacturer shall include the list developed under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Any act included in the list prepared pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section is presumed to constitute tampering; however, in any case in which a proscribed act has been committed and it can be shown that such act resulted in no increase in the sound level of the compressor or that the compressor still meets the noise emission standard of ยง 204.52, such set will not constitute tampering.

(d) The provisions of this section are not intended to preclude any State or local jurisdiction from adopting and enforcing its own prohibitions against the removal or rendering inoperative of noise control systems on compressors subject to this part.
