##### § 211.207 Computation of the noise reduction rating (NRR). #####

Calculate the NRR for hearing protective devices by substituting the average attenuation values and standard deviations for the pertinent protector category for the sample data used in steps #6 and #7 in Figure 2. The values of −.2, 0, 0, 0, −.2, −.8, −3.0 in Step 2 and −16.1, −8.6, −3.2, 0, + 1.2, + 1.0, −1.1 in Step 4 of Figure 2 represent the standard “C”- and “A”-weighting relative response corrections applied to any sound levels at the indicated octave band center frequencies. (NOTE: The manufacturer may label the protector at values lower than indicated by the test results and this computation procedure, e.g. lower NRR from lower attenuation values. (Ref. § 211.211(b).)

The value for #3 is constant. Use Logarithmic mathematics to determine the combined value of protected ear levels (Step #8) which is used in Step #9 to exactly derive the NRR; or use the following table as a substitute for logarithmic mathematics to determine the value of Step #8 and thus very closely approximate the NRR.
