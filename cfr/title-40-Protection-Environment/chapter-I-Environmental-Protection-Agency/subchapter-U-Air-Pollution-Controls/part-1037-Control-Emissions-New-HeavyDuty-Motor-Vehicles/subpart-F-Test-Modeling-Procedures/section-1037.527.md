##### ยง 1037.527 Aerodynamic measurements for vocational vehicles. #####

This section describes an optional methodology for determining improved aerodynamic drag area, *C*d*A*, for vocational vehicles, as described in ยง 1037.520(m), rather than using the assigned values. A vocational vehicle's aerodynamic performance is based on a D*C*d*A* value relative to a baseline vehicle. Determine a Dd*A* value by performing A to B testing as follows:

(a) Use any of the procedures described in this subpart, with appropriate adjustments, for calculating drag area.

(b) Determine a baseline *C*d*A* value for a vehicle representing a production configuration without the aerodynamic improvement. Repeat this testing and measure *C*d*A* for a vehicle with the improved aerodynamic design.

(c) Use good engineering judgment to perform paired tests that accurately demonstrate the reduction in aerodynamic drag associated with the improved design.

(d) Measure *C*d*A* in m2 to two decimal places. Calculate Dd*A* by subtracting the drag area for the test vehicle from the drag area for the baseline vehicle.
