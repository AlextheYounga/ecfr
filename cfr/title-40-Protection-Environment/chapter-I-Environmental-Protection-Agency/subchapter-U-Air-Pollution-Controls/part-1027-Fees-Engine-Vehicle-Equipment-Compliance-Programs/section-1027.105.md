##### § 1027.105 How much are the fees? #####

(a) Fees are determined based on the date we receive a complete application for certification. Each reference to a year in this subpart refers to the calendar year, unless otherwise specified.

See paragraph (c) of this section for provisions describing how we calculate fees for 2021 and later years.

(b) The following baseline fees apply for each application for certification:

(1) Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for Independent Commercial Importers, the following fees apply in 2020 for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines:

(c) We will calculate adjusted fees for 2021 and later years based on changes in the Consumer Price Index and the number of certificates. We will announce adjusted fees for a given year by March 31 of the preceding year.

(1) We will adjust the values specified in paragraph (b) of this section for years after 2020 as follows:

(i) Use the following equation for certification related to evaporative emissions from nonroad and stationary engines when a separate fee applies for certification to evaporative emission standards:

![](/graphics/er29jn21.011.gif)Where:Certificate FeeCY = Fee per certificate for a given year.Op = operating costs are all of EPA's nonlabor costs for each category's compliance program, including any fixed costs associated with EPA's testing laboratory, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.L = the labor costs, to be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.CPICY-2 = the Consumer Price Index for the month of November two years before the applicable calendar year, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.CPI2006 = 201.8. This is based on the October 2006 value of the Consumer Price Index. as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this sectionOH = 1.169. This is based on EPA overhead, which is applied to all costs.cert#MY-2 = the total number of certificates issued for a fee category in the model year two years before the calendar year for the applicable fees as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.cert#MY-3 = the total number of certificates issued for a fee category in the model year three years before the calendar year for the applicable fees as described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

(ii) Use the following equation for all other certificates:

![](/graphics/er29jn21.012.gif)Where:CPI2002 = 180.9. This is based on the December 2002 value of the Consumer Price Index as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(2) The fee for any year will remain at the previous year's amount until the value calculated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section differs by at least $50 from the amount specified for the previous year.

(d) Except as specified in § 1027.110(a) for motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines, we will use the following values to determine adjusted fees using the equation in paragraph (c) of this section:

(1) The following values apply for operating costs and labor costs:

(2) The applicable Consumer Price Index is based on the values published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for All Urban Consumers at *https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/*under “Inflation and Prices” and “Consumer Price Index Data from 1913 to. . . .”. For example, we calculated the 2006 fees using the Consumer Price Index for November 2004, which is 191.0.

(3) Fee categories for counting the number of certificates issued are based on the grouping shown in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
