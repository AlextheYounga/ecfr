(a) Calculate your total mass of emissions over a test cycle as specified in paragraph (c) of this section or in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart G, as applicable.

(b) See the standard-setting part for composite emission calculations over multiple test intervals and the corresponding weighting factors.

(c) Perform the following sequence of preliminary calculations to correct recorded concentration measurements before calculating mass emissions in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section:

(1) For vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR, correct all THC and CH4 concentrations for initial contamination as described in 40 CFR 1065.660(a), including continuous readings, sample bag readings, and dilution air background readings. This correction is optional for vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR.

(2) Correct all concentrations measured on a “dry” basis to a “wet” basis, including dilution air background concentrations.

(3) Calculate all NMHC and CH4 concentrations, including dilution air background concentrations, as described in 40 CFR 1065.660.

(4) For vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR, calculate HC concentrations, including dilution air background concentrations, as described in this section, and as described in § 1066.635 for NMOG. For emission testing of vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR, with fuels that contain 25% or more oxygenated compounds by volume, calculate THCE and NMHCE concentrations, including dilution air background concentrations, as described in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart I.

(5) Correct all gaseous concentrations for dilution air background as described in § 1066.610.

(g) This paragraph (g) describes how to correct flow and flow rates to standard reference conditions and provides an example for determining *V*mix based on CVS total flow and the removal of sample flow from the dilute exhaust gas. You may use predetermined nominal values for removed sample volumes, except for flows used for batch sampling.

(1) Correct flow and flow rates to standard reference conditions as needed using the following equation:

![](/graphics/er25oc16.270.gif)Where:*V*[flow]std = total flow volume at the flow meter, corrected to standard reference conditions.*V*[flow]act = total flow volume at the flow meter at test conditions.*p*in = absolute static pressure at the flow meter inlet, measured directly or calculated as the sum of atmospheric pressure plus a differential pressure referenced to atmospheric pressure.*T*std = standard temperature.*p*std = standard pressure.*T*in = temperature of the dilute exhaust sample at the flow meter inlet.Example:*V*PMact = 1.071 m3*p*in = 101.7 kPa*T*std = 293.15 K*p*std = 101.325 kPa*T*in = 340.5 K![](/graphics/er25oc16.271.gif)

(2) The following example provides a determination of *V*mix based on CVS total flow and the removal of sample flow from one dilute exhaust gas analyzer and one PM sampling system that is utilizing secondary dilution. Note that your *V*mix determination may vary from Eq. 1066.605-7 based on the number of flows that are removed from your dilute exhaust gas and whether your PM sampling system is using secondary dilution. For this example, *V*mix is governed by the following equation:

![](/graphics/er25oc16.272.gif)Where:*V*CVSstd = total dilute exhaust volume over the test interval at the flow meter, corrected to standard reference conditions.*V*gasstd = total volume of sample flow through the gaseous emission bench over the test interval, corrected to standard reference conditions.*V*PMstd = total volume of dilute exhaust sampled through the filter over the test interval, corrected to standard reference conditions.*V*sdastd = total volume of secondary dilution air flow sampled through the filter over the test interval, corrected to standard reference conditions.Example:

Using Eq. 1066.605-8:

*V*CVSstd = 170.451 m3, where *V*CVSact = 170.721 m3, *p*in = 101.7 kPa, and *T*in = 294.7 KUsing Eq. 1066.605-8:*V*gasstd = 0.028 m3, where *V*gasact = 0.033 m3, *p*in = 101.7 kPa, and *T*in = 340.5 KUsing Eq. 1066.605-8:*V*PMstd = 0.925 m3, where *V*PMact = 1.071 m3, *p*in = 101.7 kPa, and *T*in = 340.5 KUsing Eq. 1066.605-8:*V*sdastd = 0.527 m3, where *V*sdaact = 0.531 m3, *p*in = 101.7 kPa, and *T*in = 296.3 K*V*mix = 170.451 + 0.028 + 0.925 − 0.527 = 170.878 m3

(h) Calculate total flow volume over a test interval, *V*[flow], for a CVS or exhaust gas sampler as follows:

(1) *Varying versus constant flow rates.* The calculation methods depend on differentiating varying and constant flow, as follows:

(i) We consider the following to be examples of varying flows that require a continuous multiplication of concentration times flow rate: raw exhaust, exhaust diluted with a constant flow rate of dilution air, and CVS dilution with a CVS flow meter that does not have an upstream heat exchanger or electronic flow control.

(ii) We consider the following to be examples of constant exhaust flows: CVS diluted exhaust with a CVS flow meter that has an upstream heat exchanger, an electronic flow control, or both.

(2) *Continuous sampling.* For continuous sampling, you must frequently record a continuously updated flow signal. This recording requirement applies for both varying and constant flow rates.

(i) *Varying flow rate.* If you continuously sample from a varying exhaust flow rate, calculate *V*[flow] using the following equation:

![](/graphics/er29jn21.270.gif)Where:Δ*t* = 1/ƒrecord

Eq. 1066.605-11

Example:*N* = 505*Q*CVS1= 0.276 m3/s*Q*CVS2= 0.294 m3/sƒrecord = 1 HzUsing Eq. 1066.605-11:Δ*t* = 1/1 = 1 s*V*CVS = (0.276 + 0.294 + *Q*CVS505) · 1*V*CVS = 170.721 m3

(ii) *Constant flow rate.* If you continuously sample from a constant exhaust flow rate, use the same calculation described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section or calculate the mean flow recorded over the test interval and treat the mean as a batch sample, as described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii) of this section.

(3) *Batch sampling.* For batch sampling, calculate total flow by integrating a varying flow rate or by determining the mean of a constant flow rate, as follows:

(i) *Varying flow rate.* If you proportionally collect a batch sample from a varying exhaust flow rate, integrate the flow rate over the test interval to determine the total flow from which you extracted the proportional sample, as described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section.

(ii) *Constant flow rate.* If you batch sample from a constant exhaust flow rate, extract a sample at a proportional or constant flow rate and calculate *V*[flow] from the flow from which you extract the sample by multiplying the mean flow rate by the time of the test interval using the following equation:

![](/graphics/er25oc16.274.gif)Example:
