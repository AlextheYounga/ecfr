##### § 1066.615 NOX intake-air humidity correction. #####

You may correct NOX emissions for intake-air humidity as described in this section if the standard-setting part allows it. See § 1066.605(c) for the proper sequence for applying the NOX intake-air humidity correction.

(a) For vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR, apply a correction for vehicles with reciprocating engines operating over specific test cycles as follows:

(1) Calculate a humidity correction using a time-weighted mean value for ambient humidity over the test interval. Calculate absolute ambient humidity, *H*, using the following equation:

(2) Use the following equation to correct measured concentrations to a reference condition of 10.71 grams H2O vapor per kilogram of dry air for the FTP, US06, LA-92, SC03, and HFET test cycles:

Set = 1 for FTP, US06, LA-92, and HFET test cycles. Set = 0.8825 for the SC03 test cycle.*H* = ambient humidity, as determined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.Example:*H* = 7.14741 g H2O vapor/kg dry air time weighted over the FTP test cycleχNOx = 1.21 ppm![](/graphics/er19fe15.030.gif)

(b) For vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR, apply correction factors as described in 40 CFR 1065.670.
