##### § 1066.130 Measurement instrument calibrations and verifications. #####

The measurement instrument calibration and verification requirements in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart D, apply with the following exceptions:

(a) The calibration and verification provisions of 40 CFR 1065.303 do not apply for engine speed, torque, fuel rate, or intake air flow.

(b) The linearity verification provisions of 40 CFR 1065.307 do not apply for engine speed, torque, fuel rate, or intake air flow. Section 1066.135 specifies additional linearity verification provisions that apply specifically for chassis testing.

(c) The provisions of § 1066.220 apply instead 40 CFR 1065.310.

(d) The provisions of 40 CFR 1065.320, 1065.325, and 1065.395 do not apply.

(e) If you are measuring flow volumetrically (rather than measuring based on molar values), the provisions of § 1066.140 apply instead of 40 CFR 1065.340.

(f) The provisions of § 1066.150 apply instead 40 CFR 1065.350(c), 1065.355(c), 1065.370(c), and 1065.375(c).

(g) Table 1 of this section summarizes the required and recommended calibrations and verifications that are unique to testing under this part and indicates when these must be performed. Perform other required or recommended calibrations and verifications as described in 40 CFR 1065.303, with the exceptions noted in this section. Table 1 follows:
