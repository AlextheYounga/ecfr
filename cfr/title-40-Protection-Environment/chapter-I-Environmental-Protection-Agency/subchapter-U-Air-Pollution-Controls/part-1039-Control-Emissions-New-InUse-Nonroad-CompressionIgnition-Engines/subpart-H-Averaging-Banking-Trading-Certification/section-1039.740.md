##### § 1039.740 What restrictions apply for using emission credits? #####

The following restrictions apply for using emission credits:

(a) *Averaging sets.* Emission credits may be exchanged only within an averaging set. For emission credits generated by Tier 4 engines, there are two averaging sets—one for engines at or below 560 kW and another for engines above 560 kW.

(b) *Emission credits from earlier tiers of standards.* (1) For purposes of ABT under this subpart, you may not use emission credits generated from engines subject to emission standards identified in appendix I of this part, except as specified in § 1039.102(d)(1) or as follows:

|If the maximum power of the credit-generating engine is \* \* \*|And it was certified to the following standards identified in appendix I of this part \* \* \*|Then you may use those banked credits for the following Tier 4 engines \* \* \*|
|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                          (i) kW \< 19                          |                                            Tier 2                                            |                                   kW \< 19.                                   |
|                       (ii) 19 ≤ kW \< 37                       |                                            Tier 2                                            |                                   kW ≥ 19.                                    |
|                      (iii) 37 ≤ kW ≤ 560                       |                                            Tier 3                                            |                                   kW ≥ 19.                                    |
|                         (iv) kW \> 560                         |                                            Tier 2                                            |                                   kW ≥ 19.                                    |

(2) Emission credits generated from marine engines certified to the standards identified in appendix I of this part for land-based engines may not be used under this part.

(c) *NO*X*and NO*X *+ NMHC emission credits.* You may use NOX emission credits without adjustment to show compliance with NOX + NMHC standards. You may use NOX + NMHC emission credits to show compliance with NOX standards, but you must adjust the NOX + NMHC emission credits downward by twenty percent when you use them, as shown in the following equation:

NOX emission credits = (0.8) × (NOX + NMHC emission credits).

(d) *Other restrictions.* Other sections of this part specify additional restrictions for using emission credits under certain special provisions.
