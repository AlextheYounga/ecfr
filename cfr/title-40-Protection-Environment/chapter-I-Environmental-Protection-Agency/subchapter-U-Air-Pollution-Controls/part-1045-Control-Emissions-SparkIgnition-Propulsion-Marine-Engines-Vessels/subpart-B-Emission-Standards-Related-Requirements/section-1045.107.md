##### § 1045.107 What are the not-to-exceed emission standards? #####

Not-to-exceed emission standards apply as follows:

(a) Measure emissions using the not-to-exceed procedures in subpart F of this part:

(b) Determine the not-to-exceed standard, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard in Table 1 to this section from the following equation:

Not-to-exceed standard = (STD) × (M)Where:STD = The standard specified in paragraph (a) of this section if you certify without using ABT for that pollutant; or the FEL for that pollutant if you certify using ABT.M = The NTE multiplier for that pollutant, as defined in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

(c) For engines equipped with a catalyst, use NTE multipliers from the following table across the applicable zone specified in § 1045.515:

|     Pollutant     |Subzone 1|Subzone 2|
|-------------------|---------|---------|
|HC + NO<sub>X</sub>|  1.50   |  1.00   |
|        CO         |   N/A   |  1.00   |

(d) For two-stroke engines not equipped with a catalyst, use an NTE multiplier of 1.2 for HC + NOX and CO. Compare the weighted value specified in § 1045.515(c)(5) to the NTE standards specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

(e) For engines not covered by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, use the NTE multipliers from the following table across the applicable zone specified in § 1045.515:

|     Pollutant     |Subzone 1|Subzone 2|
|-------------------|---------|---------|
|HC + NO<sub>X</sub>|  1.40   |  1.60   |
|        CO         |  1.50   |  1.50   |
