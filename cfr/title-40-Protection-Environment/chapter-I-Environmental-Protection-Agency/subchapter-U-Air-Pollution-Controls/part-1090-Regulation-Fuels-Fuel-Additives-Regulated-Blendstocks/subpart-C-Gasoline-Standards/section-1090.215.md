(2) To qualify for the special regulatory treatment specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, gasoline must meet the applicable RVP per-gallon standard in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section prior to the addition of ethanol and must contain ethanol at a concentration of at least 9 volume percent and no more than 10 volume percent.

(3)(i) RFG and SIP-controlled gasoline that does not allow for the ethanol 1.0 psi waiver does not qualify for the special regulatory treatment specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(c) *Exceptions.* The RVP per-gallon standard in paragraph (a) of this section for the area in which the gasoline is located does not apply to that gasoline if the person(s) who produced, imported, sold, offered for sale, distributed, offered to distribute, supplied, offered for supply, dispensed, stored, transported, or introduced the gasoline into commerce can demonstrate one of the following:

(1) The gasoline is designated as winter gasoline and was not sold, offered for sale, supplied, offered for supply, dispensed, or introduced into commerce for use during the summer season and was not delivered to any retail station or WPC during the summer season.

(2) The gasoline is designated as summer gasoline for use in an area other than the area in which it is located and was not sold, offered for sale, supplied, offered for supply, dispensed, or introduced into commerce in the area in which the gasoline is located. In this case, the standard that applies to the gasoline is the standard applicable to the area for which the gasoline is designated.
