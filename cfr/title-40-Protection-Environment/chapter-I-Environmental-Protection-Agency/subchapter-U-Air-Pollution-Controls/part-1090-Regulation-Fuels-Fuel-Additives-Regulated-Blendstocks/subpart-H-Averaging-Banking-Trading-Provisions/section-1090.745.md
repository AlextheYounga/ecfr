Link to an amendment published at 90 FR 4353, Jan. 15, 2025.

(a) A gasoline manufacturer must calculate and report annual average sulfur and benzene concentrations for each of their facilities as specified in this section. The values calculated and reported under this section are not used to demonstrate compliance with average standards under this part.

(b) A gasoline manufacturer must calculate and report their unadjusted average sulfur concentration as follows:

![](/graphics/er04de20.015.gif)Where:Sa,y = The facility unadjusted average sulfur concentration for compliance period y, in ppm. Round and report Sa,y to two decimal places.Vi = The volume of gasoline produced or imported in batch i, in gallons.Si = The sulfur content of batch i, in ppm.n = The number of batches of gasoline produced or imported during the compliance period.i = Individual batch of gasoline produced or imported during the compliance period.

(c) A gasoline manufacturer must calculate and report their net average sulfur concentration as follows:

(d) A gasoline manufacturer must calculate and report their net average benzene concentration as follows:
