##### ยง 1065.274 Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2) NOX analyzer. #####

(a) *Application.* You may use a zirconia oxide (ZrO2) analyzer to measure NOX in raw exhaust for field-testing engines.

(b) *Component requirements.* We recommend that you use a ZrO2 analyzer that meets the specifications in Table 1 of ยง 1065.205. Note that your ZrO2-based system must meet the linearity verification in ยง 1065.307.

(c) *Species measured.* The ZrO2-based system must be able to measure and report NO and NO2 together as NOX. If the ZrO2-based system cannot measure all of the NO2, you may develop and apply correction factors based on good engineering judgment to account for this deficiency.

(d) *Interference.* You must account for NH3 interference with the NOX measurement.
