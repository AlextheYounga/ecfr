(b) In certain cases you may use test fuel not meeting the specifications in paragraph (a) of this section, as follows:

(1) You may use fuel that your in-use engines normally use, such as commercial-quality liquefied petroleum gas.

(2) You may use fuel meeting alternate specifications if the standard-setting part allows it.

(3) You may ask for approval to use fuel that does not meet the specifications in paragraph (a) of this section, but only if using the fuel would not adversely affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable standards in this chapter.

(c) When we conduct testing using liquefied petroleum gas, we will use fuel that meets the specifications in paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) At ambient conditions, liquefied petroleum gas must have a distinctive odor detectable down to a concentration in air not more than one-fifth the lower flammable limit.
