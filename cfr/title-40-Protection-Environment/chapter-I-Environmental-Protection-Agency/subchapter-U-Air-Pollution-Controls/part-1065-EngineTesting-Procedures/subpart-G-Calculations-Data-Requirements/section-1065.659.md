##### § 1065.659 Removed water correction. #####

(a) If you remove water upstream of a concentration measurement, *x*, correct for the removed water. Perform this correction based on the amount of water at the concentration measurement, *x*H2O[emission]meas, and at the flow meter, *x*H2Oexh, whose flow is used to determine the mass emission rate or total mass over a test interval. For continuous analyzers downstream of a sample dryer for transient and ramped-modal cycles, you must apply this correction on a continuous basis over the test interval, even if you use one of the options in § 1065.145(e)(2) that results in a constant value for *x*H2O[emission]meas because *x*H2Oexh varies over the test interval. For batch analyzers, determine the flow-weighted average based on the continuous *x*H2Oexh values determined as described in paragraph (c) of this section. For batch analyzers, you may determine the flow-weighted average *x*H2Oexh based on a single value of *x*H2Oexh determined as described in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, using flow-weighted average or batch concentration inputs.

(b) Determine the amount of water remaining downstream of a sample dryer and at the concentration measurement using one of the methods described in § 1065.145(e)(2). If you use a sample dryer upstream of an analyzer and if the calculated amount of water remaining downstream of the sample dryer and at the concentration measurement, *x*H2O[emission]meas, is higher than the amount of water at the flow meter, *x*H2Oexh, set *x*H2O[emission]meas equal to *x*H2Oexh. If you use a sample dryer upstream of storage media, you must be able to demonstrate that the sample dryer is removing water continuously (*i.e., x*H2Oexh is higher than *x*H2O[emission]meas throughout the test interval).

(c) For a concentration measurement where you did not remove water, you may set *x*H2O[emission]meas equal to *x*H2Oexh. You may determine the amount of water at the flow meter, *x*H2Oexh, using any of the following methods:

(1) Measure the dewpoint and absolute pressure and calculate the amount of water as described in § 1065.645.

(2) If the measurement comes from raw exhaust, you may determine the amount of water based on intake-air humidity, plus a chemical balance of fuel, DEF, intake air, and exhaust as described in § 1065.655.

(3) If the measurement comes from diluted exhaust, you may determine the amount of water based on intake-air humidity, dilution air humidity, and a chemical balance of fuel, DEF, intake air, and exhaust as described in § 1065.655.

(d) Perform a removed water correction to the concentration measurement using the following equation:
