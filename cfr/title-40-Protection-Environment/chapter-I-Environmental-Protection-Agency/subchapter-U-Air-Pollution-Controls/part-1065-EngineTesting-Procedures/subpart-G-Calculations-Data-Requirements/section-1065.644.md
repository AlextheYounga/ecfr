##### § 1065.644 Vacuum-decay leak rate. #####

This section describes how to calculate the leak rate of a vacuum-decay leak verification, which is described in § 1065.345(e). Use the following equation to calculate the leak rate, , and compare it to the criterion specified in § 1065.345(e):

Example:

*V*vac = 2.0000 L = 0.00200 m3*R* = 8.314472 J/(mol·K) = 8.314472 (m2·kg)/(s2·mol·K)*p*2 = 50.600 kPa = 50600 Pa = 50600 kg/(m·s2)*T*2 = 293.15 K*p*1 = 25.300 kPa = 25300 Pa = 25300 kg/(m·s2)*T*1 = 293.15 K*t*2 = 10:57:35 a.m.*t*1 = 10:56:25 a.m.![](/graphics/er22ap24.228.gif)[89 FR 29808, Apr. 22, 2024]
