##### § 1065.630 Local acceleration of gravity. #####

(a) The acceleration of Earth's gravity, *a*g, varies depending on the test location. Determine *a*g at your location by entering latitude, longitude, and elevation data into the U.S. National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's surface gravity prediction website at *https://geodesy.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/grav\_pdx.prl.*

(b) If the website specified in paragraph (a) of this section is unavailable, or the test location is outside of the continental United States, you may calculate *a*g for your latitude as follows:
