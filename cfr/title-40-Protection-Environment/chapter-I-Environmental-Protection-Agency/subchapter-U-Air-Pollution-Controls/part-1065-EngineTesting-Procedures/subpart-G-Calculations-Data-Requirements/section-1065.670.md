##### § 1065.670 NOX intake-air humidity and temperature corrections. #####

See the standard-setting part to determine if you may correct NOX emissions for the effects of intake-air humidity or temperature. Use the NOX intake-air humidity and temperature corrections specified in the standard-setting part instead of the NOX intake-air humidity correction specified in this part 1065. If the standard-setting part does not prohibit correcting NOX emissions for intake-air humidity according to this part 1065, correct NOX concentrations for intake-air humidity as described in this section. See § 1065.650(c)(1) for the proper sequence for applying the NOX intake-air humidity and temperature corrections. You may use a time-weighted mean intake air humidity to calculate this correction if your intake air humidity remains within a tolerance of ±0.0025 mol/mol of the mean value over the test interval. For intake-air humidity correction, use one of the following approaches:

(a) For compression-ignition engines operating on carbon-containing fuels and lean-burn combustion engines operating on fuels other than carbon-containing fuels, correct for intake-air humidity using the following equation:

(b) For spark-ignition engines operating on carbon-containing fuels and stoichiometric combustion engines operating on fuels other than carbon-containing fuels, correct for intake-air humidity using the following equation:

(c) Develop your own correction, based on good engineering judgment.
