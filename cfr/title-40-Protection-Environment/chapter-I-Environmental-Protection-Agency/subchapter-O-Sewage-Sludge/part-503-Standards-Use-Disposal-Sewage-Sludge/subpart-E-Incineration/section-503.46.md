##### ยง 503.46 Frequency of monitoring. #####

(a) *Sewage sludge.* (1) The frequency of monitoring for beryllium shall be as required in subpart C of 40 CFR part 61, and for mercury as required in subpart E of 40 CFR part 61.

(2) The frequency of monitoring for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and nickel in sewage sludge fed to a sewage sludge incinerator shall be the frequency in Table 1 of ยง 503.46.

|            Amount of sewage sludge <sup>1</sup> (metric tons per 365 day period)            |               Frequency               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
|                             Greater than zero but less than 290                             |            Once per year.             |
|                      Equal to or greater than 290 but less than 1,500                       |Once per quarter (four times per year).|
|                     Equal to or greater than 1,500 but less than 15,000                     |Once per 60 days (six times per year). |
|                               Equal to or greater than 15,000                               |  Once per month (12 times per year).  |
|<sup>1</sup> Amount of sewage sludge fired in a sewage sludge incinerator (dry weight basis).|                                       |

(3) After the sewage sludge has been monitored for two years at the frequency in Table 1 of ยง 503.46, the permitting authority may reduce the frequency of monitoring for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and nickel.

(b) *Total hydrocarbons, oxygen concentration, information to determine moisture content, and combustion temperatures.* The total hydrocarbons concentration and oxygen concentration in the exit gas from a sewage sludge incinerator stack, the information used to measure moisture content in the exit gas, and the combustion temperatures for the sewage sludge incinerator shall be monitored continuously.

(c) *Air pollution control device operating parameters.* For sewage sludge incinerators subject to the requirements in subpart O of 40 CFR part 60, the frequency of monitoring for the appropriate air pollution control device operating parameters shall be the frequency of monitoring in subpart O of 40 CFR part 60. For all other sewage sludge incinerators, the appropriate air pollution control device operating parameters shall be at least daily.
