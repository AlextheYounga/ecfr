##### § 99.43 How are the emissions qualifying for regulatory compliance exemption in the reporting year quantified? #####

(a) If the WEC applicable facility qualified for regulatory compliance exemption pursuant to § 99.41(d) for the entire reporting year, the quantity of methane emissions attributable to the regulatory compliance (ERCE,CH4) is equal to the total facility applicable emissions calculated using equation B-6 of this part. For WEC applicable facilities in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segments, as those industry segment terms are defined in § 98.230 of this chapter, the WEC applicable facility shall be considered to have qualified for the regulatory compliance exemption pursuant to § 99.41(d) for the entire reporting year if each well-pad site or gathering and boosting site, as applicable, located at the WEC applicable facility qualified for regulatory compliance exemption pursuant to § 99.41(d) for the entire reporting year.

(b) If the WEC applicable facility qualified for regulatory compliance exemption pursuant to § 99.41(d) for only part of the reporting year or for only a portion of sites for WEC applicable facilities in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segments, as those industry segment terms are defined in § 98.230 of this chapter, calculate the qualifying emissions according to the method in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable.

(1) If the WEC applicable facility is in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment, as those industry segment terms are defined in § 98.230 of this chapter, calculate the emissions qualifying for regulatory compliance exemption using equation D-1A of this section. If the result of equation D-1A of this section is less than 0 mt CH4, the emissions qualifying for regulatory compliance exemption are equal to 0 mt CH4.

(2) If the WEC applicable facility is in an industry segment other than the onshore petroleum and natural gas production or onshore petroleum and natural gas gathering and boosting industry segment, as those industry segment terms are defined in § 98.230 of this chapter, calculate the emissions qualifying for regulatory compliance exemption using equation D-1B of this section.
