##### § 99.32 How are the methane emissions caused by an unreasonable delay in environmental permitting of gathering or transmission infrastructure quantified? #####

(a) Determine the time period, in days, associated with the emissions that occurred as a result of the eligible delay within the reporting year as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) The start date of the emissions caused by the delay in the reporting year is the latter of January 1 of the reporting year, or the date on which emissions would have been avoided through commencement of the operation of the gathering or transmission infrastructure if the environmental permit application to construct and/or operate the gathering or transmission infrastructure had been approved within 36 months as specified in § 99.31(b)(6).

(2) The end time of the emissions caused by the delay in the reporting year is the earlier of December 31 of the reporting year or the date the emissions caused by the unreasonable delay ended because the infrastructure commenced operation.

(b) Determine by engineering estimates based upon best available information the increased volume of gas, in thousand standard cubic feet, resulting from methane emissions mitigation implementation during the time period determined in paragraph (a) of this section associated with each of the activities listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section. If the WEC applicable facility is in the offshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, determine these values for the WEC applicable facility in every reporting year. If the WEC applicable facility is in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment, for reporting year 2024 determine these values for the WEC applicable facility, and for reporting year 2025 and later determine these values for each well-pad site impacted by the unreasonable delay.

(1) Onsite fuel source.

(2) Another useful purpose that an otherwise purchased fuel or raw material would have served, excluding use as an onsite fuel source.

(3) Reinjection into a well.

(4) Flaring. Determine this value in accordance with this paragraph (4)(i), (ii), or (iii), as applicable. For the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment flaring volumes must be determined for each flare that received an increased volume of gas resulting from the environmental permit delay and then totaled for the WEC applicable facility or well-pad site, as applicable.

If a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) was used to measure emissions from the flare as reported pursuant to § 98.236(n)(12) of this chapter, do not determine a volume of gas for that flare.

(iii) If the WEC applicable facility is in the onshore petroleum and natural gas production industry segment for reporting year 2025 and later, for each flare that received an increased volume of gas attributable to the environmental permit delay, if flow for each stream to the flare is measured or determined in accordance with § 98.233(n)(3)(ii) of this chapter and that stream or combination of streams contain only flow resulting from the environmental permit delay, use the flow for those streams as reported to § 98.236(n)(11) of this chapter. If flow is measured at the inlet to the flare in accordance with § 98.233(n)(3)(i) of this chapter or the stream flow measured or determined in accordance with § 98.233(n)(3)(ii) of this chapter includes flow unrelated to the environmental permit delay, use an engineering estimate based upon best available information of the portion of flow resulting from the environmental permit delay.

(c) For each well-pad site or offshore platform at a WEC applicable facility impacted by an unreasonable delay in environmental permitting of gathering or transmission infrastructure, you must calculate the emissions that occurred at the well-pad site or offshore platform that were caused by the unreasonable delay according to paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section, as applicable.
