##### § 99.22 How will the net WEC emissions for a WEC obligated party be determined? #####

(a) If the condition specified in § 99.7(b)(1)(iv) does not apply for the reporting year, net WEC emissions for a WEC obligated party, equal to the sum of WEC applicable emissions from all facilities with the same WEC obligated party, as specified in § 99.2, will be calculated using equation B-8 of this section.

(b) If the condition specified in § 99.7(b)(1)(iv) applies for the reporting year, net WEC emissions for a WEC obligated party must be calculated according to this paragraph (b). The net WEC emissions for any acquired WEC applicable facilities that were not associated with the parent company reported pursuant to § 99.7(b)(1)(vi) will be calculated using equation B-8 of this section. The net WEC emissions for the WEC applicable facilities that were associated with the WEC obligated party as of December 31 of the reporting year and any acquired WEC applicable facilities that were associated with the parent company reported pursuant to § 99.7(b)(1)(vi) will be calculated using equation B-8 of this section.

(c) If net WEC emissions are calculated pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, each calculated net WEC emission value will each be treated as a distinct net WEC emission for purposes of netting under § 99.23 and for which the WEC obligation for the WEC obligated party will be determined under § 99.24.
