(b) *Annual production and consumption limits.* (1) The production baseline for regulated substances is 382,535,439 metric tons of exchange value equivalent.

(2) The consumption baseline for regulated substances is 302,538,316 metric tons of exchange value equivalent.

(3) Total production and consumption in metric tons of exchange value equivalent for regulated substances in the United States in each year is derived by multiplying the production baseline or consumption baseline by the percentage in paragraph (a) of this section. Total production and consumption allowances issued under this subpart may not exceed the quantities shown in the following table:

|         Year          |Total production  <br/>(MTEVe)|Total consumption  <br/>(MTEVe)|
|-----------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
