##### ยง 84.64 Global warming potentials. #####

(a) The global warming potential of a regulated substance is the exchange value for the regulated substance listed in subsection (c) of the AIM Act and in appendix A to this part 84.

(b) For blends containing a regulated substance, the global warming potential of the blend is the sum of the global warming potentials of each constituent of the blend multiplied by the nominal mass fraction of that constituent within the blend. The global warming potential of each constituent shall be as follows:
