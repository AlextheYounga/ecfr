##### § 59.506 How do I demonstrate compliance if I manufacture multi-component kits? #####

(a) If you manufacture multi-component kits as defined in § 59.503, then the Kit PWR must not exceed the Total Reactivity Limit.

(b) You must calculate the Kit PWR and the Total Reactivity Limit as follows:

(1) KIT PWR = (PWR(1) × W1) + (PWR(2) × W2) + . ... + (PWR(n) × Wn)

(2) Total Reactivity Limit = (RL1 × W1) + (RL2 × W2) + ... + (RLn × Wn).

(3) Kit PWR ≤Total Reactivity Limit.

Where:W = the weight of the product contents (excluding container).RL = the PWR Limit specified in Table 1 of this subpart.Subscript 1 denotes the first component product in the kit.Subscript 2 denotes the second component product in the kit.Subscript n denotes any additional component product.
