##### § 61.122 Emission standard. #####

Emissions of polonium-210 to the ambient air from all calciners and nodulizing kilns at an elemental phosphorus plant shall not exceed a total of 2 curies a year; except that compliance with this standard may be conclusively shown if the elemental phosphorus plant:

(a) Installs a Hydro-Sonic ® Tandem Nozzle Fixed Throat Free-Jet Scrubber System including four scrubber units,

(b) All four scrubber units are operated continuously with a minimum average over any 6-hour period of 40 inches (water column) of pressure drop across each scrubber during calcining of phosphate shale,

(c) The system is used to scrub emissions from all calciners and/or nodulizing kilns at the plant, and

(d) Total emissions of polonium-210 from the plant do not exceed 4.5 curies per year.

Alternative operating conditions, which can be shown to achieve an overall removal efficiency for emissions of polonium-210 which is equal to or greater than the efficiency which would be achieved under the operating conditions described in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, may be used with prior approval of the Administrator. A facility shall apply for such approval in writing, and the Administrator shall act upon the request within 30 days after receipt of a complete and technically sufficient application.[56 FR 65943, Dec. 19, 1991]
