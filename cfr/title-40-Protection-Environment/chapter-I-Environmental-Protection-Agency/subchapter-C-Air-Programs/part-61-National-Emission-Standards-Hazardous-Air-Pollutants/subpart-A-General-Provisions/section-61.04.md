(b) Section 112(d) of the Act directs the Administrator to delegate to each State, when appropriate, the authority to implement and enforce national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for stationary sources located in such State.

The Administrator may permit all or some of the information to be submitted to the appropriate State agency only, instead of to EPA and the State agency. If acceptable to both the Administrator and the owner or operator of a source, notifications and reports may be submitted on electronic media.

(10) The following table lists the delegation status of specific Part 61 Subparts that have been delegated unchanged to state and local air pollution control agencies in Region 10. An “X” indicates the subpart has been delegated, subject to all the conditions and limitations set forth in federal law, regulations, policy, guidance, and determinations. Some authorities cannot be delegated and are retained by EPA. These include certain General Provisions authorities and specific parts of some standards. The dates noted at the end of this table indicate the effective dates of federal rules that have been delegated. Any amendments made to these rules after this effective date are not delegated.
