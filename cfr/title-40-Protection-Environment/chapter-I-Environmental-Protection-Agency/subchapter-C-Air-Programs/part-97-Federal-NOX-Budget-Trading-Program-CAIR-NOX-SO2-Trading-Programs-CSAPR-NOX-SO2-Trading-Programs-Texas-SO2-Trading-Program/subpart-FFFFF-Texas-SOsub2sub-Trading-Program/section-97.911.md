(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, if a unit provided an allocation pursuant to the table in paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not operate, starting after 2018, during the control period in two consecutive years, such unit will not be allocated the Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for the unit for the control periods in the fifth year after the first such year and in each year after that fifth year. All Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances that would otherwise have been allocated to such unit will be transferred to the Supplemental Allowance Pool for potential allocation in accordance with § 97.912.

(b) [Reserved]

(c) *Units incorrectly allocated Texas SO*2 *Trading Program allowances.* (1) For each control period in 2019 and thereafter, if the Administrator determines that Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances were incorrectly allocated under paragraph (a) of this section, or under a provision of a SIP revision approved by the Administrator, then the Administrator will notify the designated representative of the recipient and will act in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section:

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section, the Administrator will not record such Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances under § 97.921.

(3) If the Administrator already recorded such Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances under § 97.921 and if the Administrator makes the determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section before making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.924(b) for such control period, then the Administrator will deduct from the account in which such Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances were recorded an amount of Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances allocated for the same or a prior control period equal to the amount of such already recorded Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances. The authorized account representative shall ensure that there are sufficient Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances in such account for completion of the deduction.

(4) If the Administrator already recorded such Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances under § 97.921 and if the Administrator makes the determination under paragraph (c)(1) of this section after making deductions for the source that includes such recipient under § 97.924(b) for such control period, then the Administrator will not make any deduction to take account of such already recorded Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances.

(5) With regard to the Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances that are not recorded, or that are deducted as an incorrect allocation, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section, the Administrator will transfer such Texas SO2 Trading Program allowances to the Supplemental Allowance Pool for potential allocation in accordance with § 97.912.
