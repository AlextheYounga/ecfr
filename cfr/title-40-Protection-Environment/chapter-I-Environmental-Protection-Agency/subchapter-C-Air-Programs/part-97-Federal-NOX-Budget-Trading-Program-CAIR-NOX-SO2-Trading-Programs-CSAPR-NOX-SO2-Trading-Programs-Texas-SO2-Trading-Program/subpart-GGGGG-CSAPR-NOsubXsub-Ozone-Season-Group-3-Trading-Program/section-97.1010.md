(ii) If the preset trading budget indicated for a given State and control period in table 2 to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section is less than the dynamic trading budget for the State and control period referenced in the applicable notice promulgated under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(C) of this section, then the State NOX Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget for the State and control period shall be the dynamic trading budget for the State and control period referenced in the applicable notice promulgated under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(C) of this section.

(3) The State NOX Ozone Season Group 3 trading budget for each State and each control period in 2030 and thereafter shall be the dynamic trading budget for the State and control period referenced in the applicable notice promulgated under paragraph (a)(4)(v)(C) of this section.

(4) The Administrator will calculate the dynamic trading budget for each State and each control period in 2026 and thereafter in the year before the year of the control period as follows:

(i) The Administrator will include a unit in a State (and Indian country within the borders of the State) in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget for a control period if—

(A) To the best of the Administrator's knowledge, the unit qualifies as a CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 3 unit under § 97.1004, without regard to whether the unit has permanently retired, provided that including a unit in the calculation of a dynamic trading budget does not constitute a determination that the unit is a CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 3 unit, and not including a unit in the calculation of a dynamic trading budget does not constitute a determination that the unit is not a CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 3 unit;

(B) The unit's deadline for certification of monitoring systems under § 97.1030(b) is on or before May 1 of the year two years before the year of the control period for which the dynamic trading budget is being calculated; and

(C) The owner or operator reported heat input greater than zero for the unit in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the historical control period in the year two years before the year of the control period for which the dynamic trading budget is being calculated.

(ii) For each unit identified for inclusion in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget for a control period under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the Administrator will calculate the heat input amount in mmBtu to be used in the budget calculation as follows:

(A) For each such unit, the Administrator will determine the following unit-level amounts:

(*1*) The total heat input amounts reported in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the unit for the historical control periods in the years two, three, four, five, and six years before the year of the control period for which the dynamic trading budget is being calculated, except any historical control period that commenced before the unit's first deadline under any regulatory program to begin recording and reporting heat input in accordance with part 75 of this chapter; and

(*2*) The average of the three highest unit-level total heat input amounts identified for the unit under paragraph (a)(4)(iv)(A)(*1*) of this section or, if fewer than three non-zero amounts are identified for the unit, the average of all such non-zero total heat input amounts.

(B) For the State, the Administrator will determine the following state-level amounts:

(*1*) The sum for all units in the State meeting the criterion under paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A) of this section, without regard to whether such units also meet the criteria under paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, of the total heat input amounts reported in accordance with part 75 of this chapter for the historical control periods in the years two, three, and four years before the year of the control period for which the dynamic trading budget is being calculated, provided that for the historical control periods in 2022 and 2023, the total reported heat input amounts for Nevada and Utah as otherwise determined under this paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(*1*) shall be increased by 13,489,332 mmBtu for Nevada and by 1,888,174 mmBtu for Utah;

(*2*) The average of the three state-level total heat input amounts calculated for the State under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(*1*) of this section; and

(*3*) The sum for all units identified for inclusion in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget for the control period under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section of the unit-level average heat input amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section.

(C) The heat input amount for a unit used in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget shall be the product of the unit-level average total heat input amount calculated for the unit under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(A)(*2*) of this section multiplied by a fraction whose numerator is the state-level average total heat input amount calculated under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section and whose denominator is the state-level sum of the unit-level average heat input amounts calculated under paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B)(*3*) of this section.

(iii) For each unit identified for inclusion in the calculation of the State's dynamic trading budget for a control period under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the Administrator will identify the NOX emissions rate in lb/mmBtu to be used in the calculation as follows:

(A) For a unit listed in the document entitled “Unit-Specific Ozone Season NOX Emissions Rates for Dynamic Budget Calculations” posted at *www.regulations.gov* in docket EPA-HQ-OAR-2021-0668, the NOX emissions rate used in the calculation for the control period shall be the NOX emissions rate shown for the unit and control period in that document.

(B) For a unit not listed in the document referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(A) of this section, the NOX emissions rate used in the calculation for the control period shall be identified according to the type of unit and the type of fuel combusted by the unit during the control period beginning May 1 on or immediately after the unit's deadline for certification of monitoring systems under § 97.1030(b) as follows:

(*1*) 0.011 lb/mmBtu, for a simple cycle combustion turbine or a combined cycle combustion turbine other than an integrated coal gasification combined cycle unit;

(*2*) 0.030 lb/mmBtu, for a boiler combusting only fuel oil or gaseous fuel (other than coal-derived fuel) during such control period; or

(*3*) 0.050 lb/mmBtu, for a boiler combusting any amount of coal or coal-derived fuel during such control period or any other unit not covered by paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B)(*1*) or (*2*) of this section.

(iv) The Administrator will calculate the State's dynamic trading budget for the control period as the sum (converted to tons at a conversion factor of 2,000 lb/ton and rounded to the nearest ton), for all units identified for inclusion in the calculation under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, of the product for each such unit of the heat input amount in mmBtu calculated for the unit under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section multiplied by the NOX emissions rate in lb/mmBtu identified for the unit under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.

(v)(A) By March 1, 2025 and March 1 of each year thereafter, the Administrator will calculate the dynamic trading budget for each State, in accordance with paragraphs (a)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section and §§ 97.1006(b)(2) and 97.1030 through 97.1035, for the control period in the year after the year of the applicable calculation deadline under this paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) and will promulgate a notice of data availability of the results of the calculations.

(B) For each notice of data availability required in paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section, the Administrator will provide an opportunity for submission of objections to the calculations referenced in such notice. Objections shall be submitted by the deadline specified in such notice and shall be limited to addressing whether the calculations (including the identification of the units included in the calculations) are in accordance with the provisions referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section.

(C) The Administrator will adjust the calculations to the extent necessary to ensure that they are in accordance with the provisions referenced in paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section. By May 1 immediately after the promulgation of each notice of data availability required in paragraph (a)(4)(v)(A) of this section, the Administrator will promulgate a notice of data availability of the results of the calculations incorporating any adjustments that the Administrator determines to be necessary and the reasons for accepting or rejecting any objections submitted in accordance with paragraph (a)(4)(v)(B) of this section.

(b) *Indian country existing unit set-asides for the control periods in 2023 and thereafter.* The Indian country existing unit set-aside for allocations of CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for each State for each control period in 2023 and thereafter shall be calculated as the sum of all allowance allocations to units in areas of Indian country within the borders of the State not subject to the State's SIP authority as provided in the applicable notice of data availability for the control period referenced in § 97.1011(a)(2).

(c) *New unit set-asides.* (1) The new unit set-asides for allocations of CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 3 allowances for the control periods in 2021 and 2022 for each State with CSAPR NOX Ozone Season Group 3 trading budgets for such control periods shall be as indicated in table 3 to this paragraph (c)(1):
