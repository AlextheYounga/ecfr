From this point the boundary moves to the west 500 feet to Aspen Creek. The boundary follows the centerline of Aspen Creek downstream to the confluence of Aspen Creek and Fontenelle Creek (in R116W T26N, Section 1). From this point the boundary moves generally to the south along the centerline of Fontenelle Creek to the confluence of Fontenelle Creek and Roney Creek (in R115W T24N Section 6). From the confluence, the boundary moves generally to the east along the centerline of Fontenelle Creek and into the Fontenelle Reservoir (in R112W T24N Section 6). The boundary moves east southeast along the centerline of the Fontenelle Reservoir and then toward the south along the centerline of the Green River to where the Green River in R111W T24N Section 31 crosses into Sweetwater County.                                                                                                                                        |           |                         |    |         |

|The area of the county west and north of the boundary which begins at the midpoint of the Green River, where the Green River enters Sweetwater County from Lincoln County in R111W T24N Section 31. From this point, the boundary follows the center of the channel of the Green River generally to the south and east to the confluence of the Green River and the Big Sandy River (in R109W T22N Section 28). From this point, the boundary moves generally north and east along the centerline of the Big Sandy River to the confluence of the Big Sandy River with Little Sandy Creek (in R106W T25N Section 33). The boundary continues generally toward the northeast along the centerline of Little Sandy Creek to the confluence of Little Sandy Creek and Pacific Creek (in R106W T25N Section 24). From this point, the boundary moves generally to the east and north along the centerline of Pacific Creek to the confluence of Pacific Creek and Whitehorse Creek (in R103W T26N Section 10). From this point the boundary follows the centerline of Whitehorse Creek generally to the northeast until it reaches the eastern boundary of Section 1 R103W T26N. From the point where Whitehorse Creek crosses the eastern section line of Section 1 R103W T26N, the boundary moves straight north along the section line to the southeast corner of Section 36 R103W T27N in Sublette County where the boundary ends.|           |                         |    |         |
