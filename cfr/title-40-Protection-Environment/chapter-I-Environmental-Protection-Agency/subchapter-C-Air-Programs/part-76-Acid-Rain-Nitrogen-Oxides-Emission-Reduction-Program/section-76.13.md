##### § 76.13 Compliance and excess emissions. #####

Excess emissions of nitrogen oxides under § 77.6 of this chapter shall be calculated as follows:

(a) For a unit that is not in an approved averaging plan:

(1) Calculate EEi for each portion of the calendar year that the unit is subject to a different NOX emission limitation:

(2) If EEi is a negative number for any portion of the calendar year, the EE value for that portion of the calendar year shall be equal to zero (e.g., if EEi = −100, then EEi = 0).

(3) Sum all EEi values for the calendar year:

where:EE = Excess emissions for NOX for the year (in tons);n = The number of time periods during which a unit is subject to different emission limitations; and

(b) For units participating in an approved averaging plan, when all the requirements under § 76.11(d)(1) are not met,
