##### § 75.13 Specific provisions for monitoring CO2 emissions. #####

(a) *CO*2*continuous emission monitoring system.* If the owner or operator chooses to use the continuous emission monitoring method, then the owner or operator shall meet the general operating requirements in § 75.10 for a CO2 continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system for each affected unit. The owner or operator shall comply with the applicable provisions specified in §§ 75.11(a) through (e) or § 75.16, except that the phrase “CO2 continuous emission monitoring system” shall apply rather than “SO2 continuous emission monitoring system,” the phrase “CO2 concentration” shall apply rather than “SO2 concentration,” the term “maximum potential concentration of CO2” shall apply rather than “maximum potential concentration of SO2,” and the phrase “CO2 mass emissions” shall apply rather than “SO2 mass emissions.”

(b) *Determination of CO*2*emissions using appendix G to this part.* If the owner or operator chooses to use the appendix G method, then the owner or operator shall follow the procedures in appendix G to this part for estimating daily CO2 mass emissions based on the measured carbon content of the fuel and the amount of fuel combusted. For units with wet flue gas desulfurization systems or other add-on emissions controls generating CO2, the owner or operator shall use the procedures in appendix G to this part to estimate both combustion-related emissions based on the measured carbon content of the fuel and the amount of fuel combusted and sorbent-related emissions based on the amount of sorbent injected. The owner or operator shall calculate daily, quarterly, and annual CO2 mass emissions (in tons) in accordance with the procedures in appendix G to this part.

(c) *Determination of CO*2*mass emissions using an O*2*monitor according to appendix F to this part.* If the owner or operator chooses to use the appendix F method, then the owner or operator shall determine hourly CO2 concentration and mass emissions with a flow monitoring system; a continuous O2 concentration monitor; fuel F and Fc factors; and, where O2 concentration is measured on a dry basis (or where Equation F-14b in appendix F to this part is used to determine CO2 concentration), either, a continuous moisture monitoring system, as specified in § 75.11(b)(2), or a fuel-specific default moisture percentage (if applicable), as defined in § 75.11(b)(1); and by using the methods and procedures specified in appendix F to this part. For units using a common stack, multiple stack, or bypass stack, the owner or operator may use the provisions of § 75.16, except that the phrase “CO2 continuous emission monitoring system” shall apply rather than “SO2 continuous emission monitoring system,” the term “maximum potential concentration of CO2” shall apply rather than “maximum potential concentration of SO2,” and the phrase “CO2 mass emissions” shall apply rather than “SO2 mass emissions.”

(d) *Determination of CO*2*mass emissions from low mass emissions units.* The owner or operator of a unit that qualifies as a low mass emissions unit under § 75.19(a) and (b) shall comply with one of the following:

(1) Meet the general operating requirements in § 75.10 for a CO2 continuous emission monitoring system and flow monitoring system;

(2) Meet the requirements specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section for use of the methods in appendix G or F to this part, respectively; or

(3) Use the low mass emissions excepted methodology in § 75.19(c) for estimating hourly CO2 mass emissions, if applicable under § 75.19(a) and (b). If this option is selected for CO2, the LME methodology must also be used for NOX and SO2 when these parameters are required to be monitored by applicable program(s).
