##### ยง 60.441 Definitions and symbols. #####

(a) Except as otherwise required by the context, terms used in this subpart are defined in the Act, in subpart A of this part, or in this section as follows:

*Coating applicator* means an apparatus used to apply a surface coating to a continuous web.

*Coating line* means any number or combination of adhesive, release, or precoat coating applicators, flashoff areas, and ovens which coat a continuous web, located between a web unwind station and a web rewind station, to produce pressure sensitive tape and label materials.

*Coating solids applied* means the solids content of the coated adhesive, release, or precoat as measured by Method 24.

*Flashoff area* means the portion of a coating line after the coating applicator and usually before the oven entrance.

*Fugitive volatile organic compounds* means any volatile organic compounds which are emitted from the coating applicator and flashoff areas and are not emitted in the oven.

*Hood or enclosure* means any device used to capture fugitive volatile organic compounds.

*Oven* means a chamber which uses heat or irradiation to bake, cure, polymerize, or dry a surface coating.

*Precoat* means a coating operation in which a coating other than an adhesive or release is applied to a surface during the production of a pressure sensitive tape or label product.

*Solvent applied in the coating* means all organic solvent contained in the adhesive, release, and precoat formulations that is metered into the coating applicator from the formulation area.

*Total enclosure* means a structure or building around the coating applicator and flashoff area or the entire coating line for the purpose of confining and totally capturing fugitive VOC emissions.

*VOC* means volatile organic compound.

(b) All symbols used in this subpart not defined below are given meaning in the Act or in subpart A of this part.

a = the gas stream vents exiting the emission control device. b = the gas stream vents entering the emission control device. Caj = the concentration of VOC (carbon equivalent) in each gas stream (j) exiting the emission control device, in parts per million by volume. Cbi = the concentration of VOC (carbon equivalent) in each gas stream (i) entering the emission control device, in parts per million by volume.Cfk = the concentration of VOC (carbon equivalent) in each gas stream (k) emitted directly to the atmosphere, in parts per million by volume.G = the calculated weighted average mass (kg) of VOC per mass (kg) of coating solids applied each calendar month.Mci = the total mass (kg) of each coating (i) applied during the calendar month as determined from facility records. Mr = the total mass (kg) of solvent recovered for a calendar month.Qaj = the volumetric flow rate of each effluent gas stream (j) exiting the emission control device, in dry standard cubic meters per hour. Qbi = the volumetric flow rate of each effluent gas stream (i) entering the emission control device, in dry standard cubic meters per hour. Qfk = the volumetric flow rate of each effluent gas stream (k) emitted to the atmosphere, in dry standard cubic meters per hour. R = the overall VOC emission reduction achieved for a calendar month (in percent).Rq = the required overall VOC emission reduction (in percent).Woi = the weight fraction of organics applied of each coating (i) applied during a calendar month as determined from Method 24 or coating manufacturer's formulation data.Wsi = the weight fraction of solids applied of each coating (i) applied during a calendar month as determined from Method 24 or coating manufacturer's formulation data.[48 FR 48375, Oct. 18, 1983, as amended at 65 FR 61761, Oct. 17, 2000]
