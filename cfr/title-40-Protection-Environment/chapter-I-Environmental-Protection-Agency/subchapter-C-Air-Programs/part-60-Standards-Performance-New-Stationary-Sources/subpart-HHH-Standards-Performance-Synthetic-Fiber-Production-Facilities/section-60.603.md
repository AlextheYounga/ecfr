##### § 60.603 Performance test and compliance provisions. #####

(a) Section 60.8(f) does not apply to the performance test procedures required by this subpart.

(b) Each owner or operator of an affected facility shall determine compliance with the applicable standard in § 60.602(a) by determining and recording monthly the VOC emissions per unit mass solvent feed from each affected facility for the current and preceding 5 consecutive calendar months and using these values to calculate the 6-month average emissions. Each calculation is considered a performance test. The owner or operator of an affected facility shall use the following procedure to determine VOC emissions for each calendar month;

(1) Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate monitoring devices that continuously measure and permanently record for each calendar month the amount of makeup solvent and solvent feed. These values shall be used in calculating VOC emissions according to paragraph (b)(2) of this section. All monitoring devices, meters, and peripheral equipment shall be calibrated and any error recorded. Total compounded error of the flow measuring and recording devices shall not exceed 1 percent accuracy over the operating range. As an alternative to measuring solvent feed, the owner or operator may:

(i) Measure the amount of recovered solvent returned to the solvent feed storage tanks, and use the following equation to determine the amount of solvent feed:

Solvent Feed = Makeup Solvent + Recovered Solvent + Change in the Amount of Solvent Contained in the Solvent Feed Holding Tank.

(ii) Measure and record the amount of polymer introduced into the affected facility and the solvent-to-polymer ratio of the spinning solutions, and use the following equation to determine the amount of solvent feed:

(2) VOC emissions shall be determined each calendar month by use of the following equations:

![](/graphics/ec16no91.084.gif)where all values are for the calendar month only and whereE = VOC Emissions, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent; SV = Measured or calculated volume of solvent feed, in liters (gallons); SW = Weight of solvent feed, in Mg (ton); MV = Measured volume of makeup solvent, in liters (gallons); MW = Weight of makeup, in kg (lb); N = Allowance for nongaseous losses, 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed; SP = Fraction of measured volume that is actual solvent (excludes water); D = Density of the solvent, in kg/liter (lb/gallon); K = Conversion factor, 1,000 kg/Mg (2,000 lb/ton); I = Allowance for solvent inventory variation or changes in the amount of solvent contained in the affected facility, in kg/Mg (lb/ton) solvent feed (may be positive or negative); IS = Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at the beginning of the test period, as determined by the owner or operator, in kg (lb); IE = Amount of solvent contained in the affected facility at the close of the test period, as determined by the owner or operator, in kg (lb).

(3) N, as used in the equation in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, equals 13 kg/Mg (26 lb/ton) solvent feed to the spinning solution preparation system and precipitation bath. This value shall be used in all cases unless an owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that greater nongaseous losses occur at the affected facility. In this case, the greater value may be substituted in the equation.
