##### § 60.313 Performance tests and compliance provisions. #####

(a) Section 60.8(d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test procedures required by this subpart.

(b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8(a) and thereafter a performance test each calendar month for each affected facility according to the procedures in this section.

(c) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for determining monthly volume-weighted average emissions of VOC's in kilograms per liter of coating solids applied (G).

(1) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for any affected facility which does not use a capture system and control device to comply with the emissions limit specified under § 60.312. The owner or operator shall determine the composition of the coatings by formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or by an analysis of each coating, as received, using Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating to determine the VOC content of coatings using Method 24. The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent used for thinning purposes from company records on a monthly basis. If a common coating distribution system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and existing facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of coating used at each facility by using the average dry weight of coating and the surface area coated by each affected and existing facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.

(i) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility, except as provided under § 60.313(c)(2) and (c)(3). Each monthly calculation is considered a performance test. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section, the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) each calendar month will be determined by the following procedures.

(A) Calculate the mass of VOC's used (Mo + Md) during each calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:

![](/graphics/ec16no91.015.gif)(ΣLdjDdj will be 0 if no VOC solvent is added to the coatings, as received.)Where: n is the number of different coatings used during the calendar month and m is the number of different diluent VOC-solvents used during the calendar month.

(B) Calculate the total volume of coating solids used (Ls) in each calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:

![](/graphics/ec16no91.016.gif)Where: n is the number of different coatings used during the calendar month.Select the appropriate transfer efficiency from table 1. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that transfer efficiencies other than those shown are appropriate, the Administrator will approve their use on a case-by-case basis. Transfer efficiency values for application methods not listed below shall be determined by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis. An owner or operator must submit sufficient data for the Administrator to judge the accuracy of the transfer efficiency claims.

|                  Application methods                   |Transfer efficiency (T)|
|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
|                   Air atomized spray                   |         0.25          |
|                     Airless spray                      |          .25          |
|               Manual electrostatic spray               |          .60          |
|      Nonrotational automatic electrostatic spray       |          .70          |
|Rotating head electrostatic spray (manual and automatic)|          .80          |
|                 Dip coat and flow coat                 |          .90          |
|                   Electrodeposition                    |          .95          |

Where more than one application method is used within a single surface coating operation, the owner or operator shall determine the composition and volume of each coating applied by each method through a means acceptable to the Administrator and compute the weighted average transfer efficiency by the following equation: ![](/graphics/ec16no91.017.gif)Where n is the number of coatings used and p is the number of application methods used.

(C) Calculate the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during the calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:

(ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions to the atmosphere (N) during the calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:

N = G

(iii) Where the volume-weighted average mass of VOC discharged to the atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) is less than or equal to 0.90 kilogram per liter, the affected facility is in compliance.

(iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a VOC content, as received, which when divided by the lowest transfer efficiency at which the coating is applied, results in a value equal to or less than 0.90 kilogram per liter, the affected facility is in compliance provided no VOC's are added to the coatings during distribution or application.

(2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for any affected facility that uses a capture system and a control device that destroys VOC's (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit specified under § 60.312.

(i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture system and control device. For the initial performance test the overall reduction efficiency (R) shall be determined as prescribed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of this section. In subsequent months, the owner or operator may use the most recently determined overall reduction efficiency (R) for the performance test providing control device and capture system operating conditions have not changed. The procedure in, paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A), (B), and (C), of this section, shall be repeated when directed by the Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the control device or capture system at conditions different from the initial performance test.

(A) Determine the fraction (F) of total VOC's emitted by an affected facility that enters the control device using the following equation:

![](/graphics/ec01jn92.010.gif)Where n is the number of gas streams entering the control device and m is the number of gas streams emitted directly to the atmosphere.

(B) Determine the destruction efficiency of the control device (E) using values of the volumetric flow rate of each of the gas streams and the VOC content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of the device by the following equation:

![](/graphics/ec01jn92.011.gif)Where: n is the number of gas streams entering the control device, and m is the number of gas streams leaving the contol device and entering the atmosphere.

(C) Determine overall reduction efficiency (R) using the following equation:

R = EF

(iii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of VOC emissions to the atmosphere (N) during each calendar month by the following equation:

N = G(1−R)

(iv) If the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's emitted to the atmosphere for each calendar month (N) is less than or equal to 0.90 kilogram per liter of coating solids applied, the affected facility is in compliance. Each monthly calculation is a performance test.

(3) An owner or operator shall use the following procedure for any affected facility which uses a control device that recovers the VOC's (e.g., carbon adsorber) to comply with the applicable emission limit specified under § 60.312.

(i) Calculate the total mass of VOC's consumed (Mo + Md) and the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility using equations in paragraph (c)(1)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of this section.
