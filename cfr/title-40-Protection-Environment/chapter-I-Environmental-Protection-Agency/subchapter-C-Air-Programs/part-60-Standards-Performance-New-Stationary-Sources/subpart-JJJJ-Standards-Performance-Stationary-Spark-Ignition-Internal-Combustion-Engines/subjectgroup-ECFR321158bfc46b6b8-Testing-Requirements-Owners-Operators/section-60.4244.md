##### § 60.4244 What test methods and other procedures must I use if I am an owner or operator of a stationary SI internal combustion engine? #####

Owners and operators of stationary SI ICE who conduct performance tests must follow the procedures in paragraphs (a) through (f) of this section.

(a) Each performance test must be conducted within 10 percent of 100 percent peak (or the highest achievable) load and according to the requirements in § 60.8 and under the specific conditions that are specified by Table 2 to this subpart.

(b) You may not conduct performance tests during periods of startup, shutdown, or malfunction, as specified in § 60.8(c). If your stationary SI internal combustion engine is non-operational, you do not need to startup the engine solely to conduct a performance test; however, you must conduct the performance test immediately upon startup of the engine.

(c) You must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in § 60.8(f). Each test run must be conducted within 10 percent of 100 percent peak (or the highest achievable) load and last at least 1 hour.

(d) To determine compliance with the NOX mass per unit output emission limitation, convert the concentration of NOX in the engine exhaust using Equation 1 of this section:

![](/graphics/er18ja08.000.gif)Where:ER = Emission rate of NOX in g/HP-hr.Cd = Measured NOX concentration in parts per million by volume (ppmv).1.912 × 10−3 = Conversion constant for ppm NOX to grams per standard cubic meter at 20 degrees Celsius.Q = Stack gas volumetric flow rate, in standard cubic meter per hour, dry basis.T = Time of test run, in hours.HP-hr = Brake work of the engine, horsepower-hour (HP-hr).

(e) To determine compliance with the CO mass per unit output emission limitation, convert the concentration of CO in the engine exhaust using Equation 2 of this section:

![](/graphics/er18ja08.001.gif)Where:ER = Emission rate of CO in g/HP-hr.Cd = Measured CO concentration in ppmv.1.164 × 10−3 = Conversion constant for ppm CO to grams per standard cubic meter at 20 degrees Celsius.Q = Stack gas volumetric flow rate, in standard cubic meters per hour, dry basis.T = Time of test run, in hours.HP-hr = Brake work of the engine, in HP-hr.

(f) For purposes of this subpart, when calculating emissions of VOC, emissions of formaldehyde should not be included. To determine compliance with the VOC mass per unit output emission limitation, convert the concentration of VOC in the engine exhaust using Equation 3 of this section:

![](/graphics/er18ja08.002.gif)Where:ER = Emission rate of VOC in g/HP-hr.Cd = VOC concentration measured as propane in ppmv.1.833 × 10−3 = Conversion constant for ppm VOC measured as propane, to grams per standard cubic meter at 20 degrees Celsius.Q = Stack gas volumetric flow rate, in standard cubic meters per hour, dry basis.T = Time of test run, in hours.HP-hr = Brake work of the engine, in HP-hr.

(g) If the owner/operator chooses to measure VOC emissions using either Method 18 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or Method 320 of 40 CFR part 63, appendix A, then it has the option of correcting the measured VOC emissions to account for the potential differences in measured values between these methods and Method 25A. The results from Method 18 and Method 320 can be corrected for response factor differences using Equations 4 and 5 of this section. The corrected VOC concentration can then be placed on a propane basis using Equation 6 of this section.
