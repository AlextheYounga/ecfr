##### § 60.374 Test methods and procedures. #####

(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).

(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the lead standards in § 60.372, except § 60.372(a)(4), as follows:

(1) Method 12 or Method 29 shall be used to determine the lead concentration (CPb) and, if applicable, the volumetric flow rate (Qsda) of the effluent gas. The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf).

(2) When different operations in a three-process operation facility are ducted to separate control devices, the lead emission concentration (C) from the facility shall be determined as follows:

![](/graphics/er27fe14.006.gif)Where:C = concentration of lead emissions for the entire facility, mg/dscm (gr/dscf).Ca = concentration of lead emissions from facility “a”, mg/dscm (gr/dscf).Qsda = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas from facility “a”, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).N = total number of control devices to which separate operations in the facility are ducted.

(3) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity. The opacity numbers shall be rounded off to the nearest whole percentage.

(c) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the lead standard in § 60.372(a)(4) as follows:

(1) The emission rate (E) from lead oxide manufacturing facility shall be computed for each run using the following equation:

![](/graphics/ec16no91.023.gif)where:E = emission rate of lead, mg/kg (lb/ton) of lead charged.CPbi = concentration of lead from emission point “i,” mg/dscm (gr/dscf).Qsdi = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas from emission point “i,” dscm/hr (sdcf/hr).M = number of emission points in the affected facility.P = lead feed rate to the facility, kg/hr (ton/hr).K = conversion factor, 1.0 mg/mg (7000 gr/lb).

(2) Method 12 or Method 29 shall be used to determine the lead concentration (CPb) and the volumetric flow rate (Qsd) of the effluent gas. The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.85 dscm (30 dscf).

(3) The average lead feed rate (P) shall be determined for each run using the following equation:

P = N W/Θwhere:N = number of lead pigs (ingots) charged.W = average mass of a pig, kg (ton).Θ = duration of run, hr.[54 FR 6675, Feb. 14, 1989, as amended at 65 FR 61760, Oct. 17, 2000; 79 FR 11250, Feb. 27, 2014]
