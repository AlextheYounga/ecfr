##### § 60.292 Standards for particulate matter. #####

(a) On and after the date on which the performance test required to be conducted by § 60.8 is completed, no owner or operator of a glass melting furnace subject to the provisions of this subpart shall cause to be discharged into the atmosphere—

(1) From any glass melting furnace fired exclusively with either a gaseous fuel or a liquid fuel, particulate matter at emission rates exceeding those specified in table CC-1, Column 2 and Column 3, respectively, or

(2) From any glass melting furnace, fired simultaneously with gaseous and liquid fuels, particulate matter at emission rates exceeding STD as specified by the following equation:

STD = X [1.3(Y) + (Z)] Where:STD = Particulate matter emission limit, g of particulate/kg (lb of particulate/ton) of glass produced. X = Emission rate specified in table CC-1 for furnaces fired with gaseous fuel (Column 2). Y = Decimal fraction of liquid fuel heating value to total (gaseous and liquid) fuel heating value fired in the glass melting furnaces as determined in § 60.296(b). (joules/joules). Z = (1-Y).

(b) Conversion of a glass melting furnace to the use of liquid fuel is not considered a modification for the purposes of § 60.14.

(c) Rebricking and the cost of rebricking is not considered a reconstruction for the purposes of § 60.15.

(d) An owner or operator of an experimental furnace is not subject to the requirements of this section.

(e) During routine maintenance of add-on pollution controls, an owner or operator of a glass melting furnace subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section is exempt from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section if:

(1) Routine maintenance in each calendar year does not exceed 6 days;

(2) Routine maintenance is conducted in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions; and

(3) A report is submitted to the Administrator 10 days before the start of the routine maintenance (if 10 days cannot be provided, the report must be submitted as soon as practicable) and the report contains an explanation of the schedule of the maintenance.
