(a) All terms used in this subpart not defined below are given the same meaning as in the Act or in subpart A of this part.

*Coating* means any organic material that is applied to the surface of metal coil.

*Coating application station* means that portion of the metal coil surface coating operation where the coating is applied to the surface of the metal coil. Included as part of the coating application station is the flashoff area between the coating application station and the curing oven.

*Curing oven* means the device that uses heat or radiation to dry or cure the coating applied to the metal coil.

*Finish coat operation* means the coating application station, curing oven, and quench station used to apply and dry or cure the final coating(s) on the surface of the metal coil. Where only a single coating is applied to the metal coil, that coating is considered a finish coat.

*Metal coil surface coating operation* means the application system used to apply an organic coating to the surface of any continuous metal strip with thickness of 0.15 millimeter (mm) (0.006 in.) or more that is packaged in a roll or coil.

*Prime coat operation* means the coating application station, curing oven, and quench station used to apply and dry or cure the initial coating(s) on the surface of the metal coil.

*Quench station* means that portion of the metal coil surface coating operation where the coated metal coil is cooled, usually by a water spray, after baking or curing.

*VOC content* means the quantity, in kilograms per liter of coating solids, of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) in a coating.

(b) All symbols used in this subpart not defined below are given the same meaning as in the Act and in subpart A of this part.

Ca = the VOC concentration in each gas stream leaving the control device and entering the atmosphere (parts per million by volume, as carbon).Cb = the VOC concentration in each gas stream entering the control device (parts per million by volume, as carbon).Cf = the VOC concentration in each gas steam emitted directly to the atmosphere (parts per million by volume, as carbon).Dc = density of each coating, as received (kilograms per liter).Dd = density of each VOC-solvent added to coatings (kilograms per liter).Dr = density of VOC-solvent recovered by an emission control device (kilograms per liter).E= VOC destruction efficiency of the control device (fraction).F= the proportion of total VOC's emitted by an affected facility that enters the control device (fraction).G= volume-weighted average mass of VOC's in coatings consumed in a calendar month per unit volume of coating solids applied (kilograms per liter).Lc = the volume of each coating consumed, as received (liters).Ld = the volume of each VOC-solvent added to coatings (liters).Lr = the volume of VOC-solvent recovered by an emission control device (liters).Ls = the volume of coating solids consumed (liters).Md = the mass of VOC-solvent added to coatings (kilograms).Mo = the mass of VOC's in coatings consumed, as received (kilograms).Mr = the mass of VOC's recovered by an emission control device (kilograms).N= the volume-weighted average mass of VOC emissions to the atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (kilograms per liter).Qa = the volumetric flow rate of each gas stream leaving the control device and entering the atmosphere (dry standard cubic meters per hour).Qb = the volumetric flow rate of each gas stream entering the control device (dry standard cubic meters per hour).Qf = the volumetric flow rate of each gas steam emitted directly to the atmosphere (dry standard cubic meters per hour).R= the overall VOC emission reduction achieved for an affected facility (fraction).S= the calculated monthly allowable emission limit (kilograms of VOC per liter of coating solids applied).Vs = the proportion of solids in each coating, as received (fraction by volume).Wo = the proportion of VOC's in each coating, as received (fraction by weight).
