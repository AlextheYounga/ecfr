##### § 60.463 Performance test and compliance provisions. #####

(a) Section 60.8(d) and (f) do not apply to the performance test.

(b) The owner or operator of an affected facility shall conduct an initial performance test as required under § 60.8(a) and thereafter a performance test for each calendar month for each affected facility according to the procedures in this section.

(c) The owner or operator shall use the following procedures for determining monthly volume-weighted average emissions of VOC's in kg/*l* of coating solids applied.

(1) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility that does not use a capture system and control device to comply with the emission limit specified under § 60.462(a)(1). The owner or operator shall determine the composition of the coatings by formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coating or by an analysisof each coating, as received, using Method 24. The Administrator may require the owner or operator who uses formulation data supplied by the manufacturer of the coatings to determine the VOC content of coatings using Method 24 or an equivalent or alternative method. The owner or operator shall determine the volume of coating and the mass of VOC-solvent added to coatings from company records on a monthly basis. If a common coating distribution system serves more than one affected facility or serves both affected and existing facilities, the owner or operator shall estimate the volume of coating used at each affected facility by using the average dry weight of coating and the surface area coated by each affected and existing facility or by other procedures acceptable to the Administrator.

(i) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's consumed per unit volume of coating solids applied during each calendar month for each affected facility, except as provided under paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section. The weighted average of the total mass of VOC's used per unit volume of coating solids applied each calendar month is determined by the following procedures.

(A) Calculate the mass of VOC's used (Mo + Md) during each calendar month for each affected facility by the following equation:

(iii) Where the volume-weighted average mass of VOC's discharged to the atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) is equal to or less than 0.28 kg/*l*, the affected facility is in compliance.

(iv) If each individual coating used by an affected facility has a VOC content, as received, that is equal to or less than 0.28 kg/*l* of coating solids, the affected facility is in compliance provided no VOC's are added to the coatings during distribution or application.

(2) An owner or operator shall use the following procedures for each affected facility that continuously uses a capture system and a control device that destroys VOC's (e.g., incinerator) to comply with the emission limit specified under § 60.462(a) (2) or (3).

(i) Determine the overall reduction efficiency (R) for the capture system and control device.

For the initial performance test, the overall reduction efficiency (R) shall be determined as prescribed in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of this section. In subsequent months, the owner or operator may use the most recently determined overall reduction efficiency (R) for the performance test, providing control device and capture system operating conditions have not changed. The procedure in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of this section, shall be repeated when directed by the Administrator or when the owner or operator elects to operate the control device or capture system at conditions different from the initial performance test.

(A) Determine the fraction (F) of total VOC's emitted by an affected facility that enters the control device using the following equation:

![](/graphics/ec01jn92.035.gif)Equation 5 Where:*l* is the number of gas streams entering the control device, andp is the number of gas streams emitted directly to the atmosphere.

(B) Determine the destruction efficiency of the control device (E) using values of the volumetric flow rate of each of the gas streams and the VOC content (as carbon) of each of the gas streams in and out of the device by the following equation:

![](/graphics/ec01jn92.036.gif)Equation 6 Where:n is the number of gas streams entering the control device, andm is the number of gas streams leaving the control device and entering the atmosphere.The owner or operator of the affected facility shall construct the VOC emission reduction system so that all volumetric flow rates and total VOC emissions can be accurately determined by the applicable test methods and procedures specified in § 60.466. The owner or operator of the affected facility shall construct a temporary enclosure around the coating applicator and flashoff area during the performance test for the purpose of evaluating the capture efficiency of the system. The enclosure must be maintained at a negative pressure to ensure that all VOC emissions are measurable. If a permanent enclosure exists in the affected facility prior to the performance test and the Administrator is satisfied that the enclosure is adequately containing VOC emissions, no additional enclosure is required for the performance test.

(C) Determine overall reduction efficiency (R) using the following equation:

![](/graphics/ec16no91.045.gif)If the overall reduction efficiency (R) is equal to or greater than 0.90, the affected facility is in compliance and no further computations are necessary. If the overall reduction efficiency (R) is less than 0.90, the average total VOC emissions to the atmosphere per unit volume of coating solids applied (N) shall be computed as follows.

(ii) Calculate the volume-weighted average of the total mass of VOC's per unit volume of coating solids applied (G) during each calendar month for each affected facility using equations in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) (A), (B), and (C) of this section.
