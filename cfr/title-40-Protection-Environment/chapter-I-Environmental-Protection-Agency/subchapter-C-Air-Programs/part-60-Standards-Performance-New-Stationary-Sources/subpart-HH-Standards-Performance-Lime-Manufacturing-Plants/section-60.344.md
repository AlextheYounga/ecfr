##### § 60.344 Test methods and procedures. #####

(a) In conducting the performance tests required in § 60.8, the owner or operator shall use as reference methods and procedures the test methods in appendix A of this part or other methods and procedures as specified in this section, except as provided in § 60.8(b).

(b) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the particulate matter standards in § 60.342(a) as follows:

(1) The emission rate (E) of particulate matter shall be computed for each run using the following equation:

E = (cs Qsd)/PK)where: E = emission rate of particulate matter, kg/Mg (1b/ton) of stone feed. cs = concentration of particulate matter, g/dscm (gr/dscf). Qsd = volumetric flow rate of effluent gas, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).P = stone feed rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr). K = conversion factor, 1000 g/kg (7000 gr/lb).

(2) Method 5 shall be used at negative-pressure fabric filters and other types of control devices and Method 5D shall be used at positive-pressure fabric filters to determine the particulate matter concentration (cs) and the volumetric flow rate (Qsd) of the effluent gas. The sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 0.90 dscm (31.8 dscf).

(3) The monitoring device of § 60.343(d) shall be used to determine the stone feed rate (P) for each run.

(4) Method 9 and the procedures in § 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.

(c) During the particulate matter run, the owner or operator shall use the monitoring devices in § 60.343(c)(1) and (2) to determine the average pressure loss of the gas stream through the scrubber and the average scrubbing liquid supply pressure.
