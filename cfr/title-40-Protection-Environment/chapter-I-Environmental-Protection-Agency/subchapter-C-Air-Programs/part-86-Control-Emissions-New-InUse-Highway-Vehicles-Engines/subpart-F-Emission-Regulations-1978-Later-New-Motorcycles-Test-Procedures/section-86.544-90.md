##### § 86.544-90 Calculations; exhaust emissions. #####

This section describes how to calculate exhaust emissions. Determine emission results for each pollutant to at least one more decimal place than the applicable standard. Apply the deterioration factor, then round the adjusted figure to the same number of decimal places as the emission standard. Compare the rounded emission levels to the emission standard for each emission data vehicle. In the case of NOX + HC standards, apply the deterioration factor to each pollutant and then add the results before rounding.

(a) Calculate a composite FTP emission result using the following equation:

(4) For a 1978 motorcycle with an engine displacement equal to or greater than 170 cc (10.4 cu. in):

(i) HCwm = 0.43 [(11.114 + 7.184)/(5.650 + 6.070)] + 0.57 [(6.122 + 7.184)/(5.660 + 6.070)] = 1.318 grams per vehicle kilometer.

(ii) NOxwm = 0.43 [(4.733 = 2.154)/(5.650 = 6.070)] = 0.57 [(7.056 = 2.154)/(5.660 = 6.070)] = 0.700 gram per vehicle kilometer.

(iii) COwm = 0.43 [(27.362 + 64.541)/(5.650 + 6.070)] + 0.57 [(34.964 + 64.541)/(5.660 + 6.070)] = 8.207 grams per vehicle kilometer.

(iv) CO2wm = 0.43 [(549.81 + 529.52)/(5.650 + 6.070)] + 0.57 [(480.93 + 529.52)/(5.660 + 6.070)] = 88.701 grams per vehicle kilometer.
