(xxv) CH4conc = 2.825-2.019(1-1/24.939) = 0.89 ppm.

(xxvi) NMHCconc = 3.553 ppm−0.89 ppm = 2.67 ppm.

(xxvii) NMHCmass = (6048.1)(16.33)(2.67/1,000,000) = 0.263 grams per test phase.

(xxviii) NMHCEmass = 0.263 + (13.8756/32.042)(2.44) + (13.8756/ 30.0262)(0.1405) = 1.39 grams per test phase.

(2) For the stabilized portion of the cold start test assume that similar calculations resulted in the following:

(i) THCE = 0.143 grams per test phase.

(ii) NOXmass = 0.979 grams per test phase.

(iii) COmass = 0.365 grams per test phase.

(iv) CO2mass = 1467 grams per test phase.

(v) Ds = 3.854 miles.

(vi) NMHCE = 0.113 grams per test phase.

(3) For the “transient” portion of the hot start test assume that similar calculations resulted in the following:

(i) THCE = 0.488 grams as carbon equivalent per test phase.

(ii) NOXmass = 1.505 grams per test phase.

(iii) COmass = 3.696 grams per test phase.

(iv) CO2mass = 1179 grams per test phase.

(v) Dht = 3.577 miles.

(vi) NMHCE = 0.426 grams per test phase.

(4) Weighted emission results:

(i) THCEwm = (0.43) × (1.473 + 0.143)/(3.583 + 3.854) + (0.57) × (0.488 + 0.143)/(3.577 + 3.854) = 0.142 grams as carbon equivalent per mile.

(ii) NOxwm = (0.43) × (1.505 + 0.979)/(3.583 + 3.854) + (0.57) × (1.505 + 0.979)/3.577 + 3.854) = 0.344 grams per mile.

(iii) COwm = (0.43) × (18.983 + 0.365)/(3.583 = 3.854) + (0.57) × (3.696 + 0.365)/(3.577 + 3.854) = 1.43 grams per mile.

(iv) CO2wm = (0.43) × (1353 + 1467)/(3.583 + 3.854) + (0.57) × (1179 + 1467)/(3.577 + 3.854) = 366 grams per mile.

(v) NMHCEwm = (0.43) × (1.386 + 0.113)/(3.583 + 3.854) + (0.57) × (0.426 = 0.113)/(3.577 + 3.854) = 0.128 grams per mile.
