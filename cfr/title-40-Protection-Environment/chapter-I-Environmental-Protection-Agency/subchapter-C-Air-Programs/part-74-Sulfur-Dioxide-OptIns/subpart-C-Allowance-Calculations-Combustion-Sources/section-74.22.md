##### § 74.22 Actual SO2 emissions rate. #####

(a) *Data requirements.* The designated representative of a combustion source shall submit the calculations under this section based on data submitted under § 74.20 for the following calendar year:

(1) For combustion sources that commenced operation prior to January 1, 1985, the calendar year for calculating the actual SO2 emissions rate shall be 1985.

(2) For combustion sources that commenced operation after January 1, 1985, the calendar year for calculating the actual SO2 emissions rate shall be the first year of the three consecutive calendar years of the alternative baseline under § 74.20(b)(2).

(3) For combustion sources meeting the requirements of § 74.20(c), the calendar year for calculating the actual SO2 emissions rate shall be the first year of the three consecutive calendar years to be used as alternative data under § 74.20(c).

(b) *SO*2*emissions factor calculation.* The SO2 emissions factor for each type of fuel consumed during the specified year, expressed in pounds per thousand tons for coal, pounds per thousand barrels for oil and pounds per million cubic feet (scf) for gas, shall be calculated as follows:

SO2 Emissions Factor = (average percent of sulfur by weight) × (k),where,average percent of sulfur by weight= annual average, for a combustion source submitting annual data= monthly average, for a combustion source submitting monthly datak = 39,000 for bituminous coal or anthracite= 35,000 for subbituminous coal= 30,000 for lignite= 5,964 for distillate (light) oil= 6,594 for residual (heavy) oil= 0.6 for natural gasFor other fuels, the combustion source must specify the SO2 emissions factor.

(c) *Annual SO*2*emissions calculation.* Annual SO2 Emissions for the specified calendar year, expressed in pounds, shall be calculated as follows:

(1) For a combustion source submitting monthly data,

(2) For a combustion source submitting annual data:

(d) *Annual fuel consumption calculation.* Annual fuel consumption for the specified calendar year, expressed in mmBtu, shall be calculated as defined under § 74.20(b)(1) (i) or (ii).

(e) *Actual SO*2*emissions rate calculation.* The actual SO2 emissions rate for the specified calendar year, expressed in lbs/mmBtu, shall be calculated as follows:
