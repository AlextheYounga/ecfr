##### § 74.23 1985 Allowable SO2 emissions rate. #####

(a) *Data requirements.* (1) The designated representative of the combustion source shall submit the following data and the calculations under paragraph (b) of this section based on the submitted data:

(i) Allowable SO2 emissions rate of the combustion source expressed in lbs/mmBtu as defined under § 72.2 of this chapter for the calendar year specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the allowable SO2 emissions rate is not expressed in lbs/mmBtu, the allowable emissions rate shall be converted to lbs/mmBtu by multiplying the emissions rate by the appropriate factor as specified in Table 1 of this section.

(2) *Calendar year.* (i) For combustion sources that commenced operation prior to January 1, 1985, the calendar year for the allowable SO2 emissions rate shall be 1985.

(ii) For combustion sources that commenced operation after January 1, 1985, the calendar year for the allowable SO2 emissions rate shall be the first year of the three consecutive calendar years of the alternative baseline under § 74.20(b)(2).

(iii) For combustion sources meeting the requirements of § 74.20(c), the calendar year for calculating the allowable SO2 emissions rate shall be the first year of the three consecutive calendar years to be used as alternative data under § 74.20(c).

(b) *1985 Allowable SO*2*emissions rate calculation.* The allowable SO2 emissions rate for the specified calendar year shall be calculated as follows:

1985 Allowable SO2 Emissions Rate = (Allowable SO2 Emissions Rate) × (Annualization Factor)
