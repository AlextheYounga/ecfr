(b) EPA will calculate the value of the annual standards and publish these values in the Federal Register by November 30 of the year preceding the compliance period.

(c) EPA will calculate the annual renewable fuel percentage standards using the following equations:

(d) The price for cellulosic biofuel waiver credits will be calculated in accordance with § 80.1456(d) and published on EPA's Web site.
