(3) Except as provided in subpart II of this part, the owners and operators of a CAIR NOX source that is not otherwise required to have a title V operating permit and each CAIR NOX unit that is not otherwise required to have a title V operating permit are not required to submit a CAIR permit application, and to have a CAIR permit, under subpart CC of this part for such CAIR NOX source and such CAIR NOX unit.

(b) *Monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.* (1) The owners and operators, and the CAIR designated representative, of each CAIR NOX source and each CAIR NOX unit at the source shall comply with the monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements of subpart HH of this part.

(2) The emissions measurements recorded and reported in accordance with subpart HH of this part shall be used to determine compliance by each CAIR NOX source with the CAIR NOX emissions limitation under paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) *Nitrogen oxides emission requirements.* (1) As of the allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the owners and operators of each CAIR NOX source and each CAIR NOX unit at the source shall hold, in the source's compliance account, CAIR NOX allowances available for compliance deductions for the control period under § 96.154(a) in an amount not less than the tons of total nitrogen oxides emissions for the control period from all CAIR NOX units at the source, as determined in accordance with subpart HH of this part.

(2) A CAIR NOX unit shall be subject to the requirements under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the control period starting on the later of January 1, 2009 or the deadline for meeting the unit's monitor certification requirements under § 96.170(b)(1), (2), or (5) and for each control period thereafter.

(5) A CAIR NOX allowance is a limited authorization to emit one ton of nitrogen oxides in accordance with the CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program. No provision of the CAIR NOX Annual Trading Program, the CAIR permit application, the CAIR permit, or an exemption under § 96.105 and no provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the State or the United States to terminate or limit such authorization.

This period may be extended for cause, at any time before the end of 5 years, in writing by the permitting authority or the Administrator.

(i) The certificate of representation under § 96.113 for the CAIR designated representative for the source and each CAIR NOX unit at the source and all documents that demonstrate the truth of the statements in the certificate of representation; provided that the certificate and documents shall be retained on site at the source beyond such 5-year period until such documents are superseded because of the submission of a new certificate of representation under § 96.113 changing the CAIR designated representative.
