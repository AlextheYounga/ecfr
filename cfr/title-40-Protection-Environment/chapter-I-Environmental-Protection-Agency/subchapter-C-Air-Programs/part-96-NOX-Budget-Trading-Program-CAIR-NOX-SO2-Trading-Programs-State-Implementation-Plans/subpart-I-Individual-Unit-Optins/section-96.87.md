##### § 96.87 Change in regulatory status. #####

(a) *Notification.* When a NOX Budget opt-in source becomes a NOX Budget unit under § 96.4, the NOX authorized account representative shall notify in writing the permitting authority and the Administrator of such change in the NOX Budget opt-in source's regulatory status, within 30 days of such change.

(b) *Permitting authority's and Administrator's action.* (1)(i) When the NOX Budget opt-in source becomes a NOX Budget unit under § 96.4, the permitting authority will revise the NOX Budget opt-in source's NOX Budget opt-in permit to meet the requirements of a NOX Budget permit under § 96.23 as of an effective date that is the date on which such NOX Budget opt-in source becomes a NOX Budget unit under § 96.4.

(ii)(A) The Administrator will deduct from the compliance account for the NOX Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or the overdraft account of the NOX Budget source where the unit is located, NOX allowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as:

(*1*) Any NOX allowances allocated to the NOX Budget unit (as a NOX Budget opt-in source) under § 96.88 for any control period after the last control period during which the unit's NOX Budget opt-in permit was effective; and

(*2*) If the effective date of the NOX Budget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the NOX allowances allocated to the NOX Budget unit (as a NOX Budget opt-in source) under § 96.88 for the control period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the control period.

(B) The NOX authorized account representative shall ensure that the compliance account of the NOX Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or the overdraft account of the NOX Budget source where the unit is located, includes the NOX allowances necessary for completion of the deduction under paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain sufficient NOX allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NOX allowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NOX allowances are recorded in either account.

(iii)(A) For every control period during which the NOX Budget permit revised under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is effective, the NOX Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section will be treated, solely for purposes of NOX allowance allocations under § 96.42, as a unit that commenced operation on the effective date of the NOX Budget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section and will be allocated NOX allowances under § 96.42.

(B) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, if the effective date of the NOX Budget permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is during a control period, the following number of NOX allowances will be allocated to the NOX Budget unit under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section under § 96.42 for the control period: the number of NOX allowances otherwise allocated to the NOX Budget unit under § 96.42 for the control period multiplied by the ratio of the number of days, in the control period, starting with the effective date of the permit revision under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, divided by the total number of days in the control period.

(2)(i) When the NOX authorized account representative of a NOX Budget opt-in source does not renew its NOX Budget opt-in permit under § 96.83(b), the Administrator will deduct from the NOX Budget opt-in unit's compliance account, or the overdraft account of the NOX Budget source where the NOX Budget opt-in source is located, NOX allowances equal in number to and allocated for the same or a prior control period as any NOX allowances allocated to the NOX Budget opt-in source under § 96.88 for any control period after the last control period for which the NOX Budget opt-in permit is effective. The NOX authorized account representative shall ensure that the NOX Budget opt-in source's compliance account or the overdraft account of the NOX Budget source where the NOX Budget opt-in source is located includes the NOX allowances necessary for completion of such deduction. If the compliance account or overdraft account does not contain sufficient NOX allowances, the Administrator will deduct the required number of NOX allowances, regardless of the control period for which they were allocated, whenever NOX allowances are recorded in either account.

(ii) After the deduction under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is completed, the Administrator will close the NOX Budget opt-in source's compliance account. If any NOX allowances remain in the compliance account after completion of such deduction and any deduction under § 96.54, the Administrator will close the NOX Budget opt-in source's compliance account and will establish, and transfer any remaining allowances to, a new general account for the owners and operators of the NOX Budget opt-in source. The NOX authorized account representative for the NOX Budget opt-in source shall become the NOX authorized account representative for the general account.
