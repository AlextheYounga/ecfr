This disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(1).

(c) Disapproval—USEPA disapproves Rule 204(e)(4) as not being adequate to protect the NAAQS. This disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(I).

(d) Disapproval—USEPA disapproves Rule 204(f)(1)(D) as completely deregulating SO2 emissions from existing processes without providing an assessment of the ambient air quality impact or a showing that increasing the allowable emissions from these sources will not cause or contribute to violations of the NAAQS or PSD increments. This disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(I).

(e) Disapproval—USEPA disapproves Rule 204(h) for those sources for which USEPA has disapproved rules 204(c) and 204(e). This disapproval does not in and of itself result in the growth restrictions of section 110(a)(2)(I).

(f) Approval—USEPA approves rule 204(e)(3) for those sources able to show that the proposed emission rate will not cause or contribute to a violation of the NAAQS. The State must submit these emission limitations, along with the technical support to USEPA for approval.

(g) Part D—Approval—The State plan for Alton Township, Madison County, which consists of a federally Enforceable State Operating Permit controlling sulfur dioxide emissions from the boilers and reheat furnaces at Laclede Steel, which was submitted on November 18, 1993, is approved.

(h) Approval—On November 10, 1994, the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency submitted a sulfur dioxide redesignation request and maintenance plan for Peoria and Hollis Townships in Peoria County and Groveland Township in Tazewell County to redesignate the townships to attainment for sulfur dioxide. The redesignation request and maintenance plan meet the redesignation requirements in section 107(d)(3)(d) of the Clean Air Act (Act) as amended in 1990.
