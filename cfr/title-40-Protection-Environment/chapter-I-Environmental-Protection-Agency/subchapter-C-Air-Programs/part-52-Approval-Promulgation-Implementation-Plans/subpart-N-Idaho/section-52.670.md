|<sup>2</sup> Only a small portion of this facility is located on State lands. The vast majority of the facility is located in Indian Country. It is EPA's position that unless EPA has explicitly approved a program as applying in Indian country, State or local regulations or permits are not effective within the boundaries of that Indian country land for purposes of complying with the CAA.
