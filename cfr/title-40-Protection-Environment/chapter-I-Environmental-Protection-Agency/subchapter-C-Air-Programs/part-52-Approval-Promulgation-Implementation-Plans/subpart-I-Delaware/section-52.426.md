(e) EPA approves Delaware's revised 2005 VOC and NOX motor vehicle emission budgets for the 1-hour ozone attainment plan for the Delaware portion of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe ozone nonattainment area as a SIP revision. The revisions were submitted by the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control on September 2, 2003. Submittal of these revised MOBILE6-based motor vehicle emissions budgets was a requirement of EPA's approval of the attainment demonstration under paragraph (c) of this section.

(f) Based upon EPA's review of the air quality data for the 3-year period 2003 to 2005, EPA has determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined that the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the imposition of the section 185 penalty fees.

(g) EPA approves revisions to the Delaware State Implementation Plan consisting of the 2008 reasonable further progress (RFP) plan, reasonably available control measures, and contingency measures for the Delaware portion of the Philadelphia 1997 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area submitted by the Secretary of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control on June 13, 2007.

(i) *Determination of attainment.* EPA has determined, as of March 26, 2012, that based on 2008 to 2010 ambient air quality data, Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE 8-hour ozone moderate nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.918, suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 annual 8-hour ozone NAAQS.
