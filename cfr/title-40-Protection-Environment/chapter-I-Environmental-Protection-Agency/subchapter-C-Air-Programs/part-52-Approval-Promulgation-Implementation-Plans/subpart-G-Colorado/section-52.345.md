The State of Colorado has committed to revise its stack height regulations should EPA complete rulemaking to respond to the decision in *NRDC* v. *Thomas,* 838 F. 2d 1224 (DC Cir. 1988). In a letter to Mr. Douglas M. Skie, EPA, dated May 9, 1988, Bradley J. Beckham, Director of the Colorado Air Pollution Control Division stated:

\* \* \* We are submitting this letter to allow EPA to continue to process our current SIP submittal with the understanding that if EPA's response to the NRDC remand modified the July 8, 1985, regulations, EPA will notify the state of the rules that must be changed to comply with the EPA's modified requirements. The State of Colorado agrees to make appropriate changes.
