##### § 52.2592 Review of new sources and modifications. #####

Disapproval—On May 12, 2011, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources submitted a proposed revision to its State Implementation Plan to update its rules to match the 2008 New Source Review Implementation Rule for PM2.5. The State supplemented the submittal on March 5, 2012. EPA determined that this submittal was not approvable because the revisions did not explicitly identify the precursors to PM2.5 and did not contain the prescribed language to ensure that gases that condense to form PM, known as condensables, are regulated within PM2.5 and PM10 emission limits.
