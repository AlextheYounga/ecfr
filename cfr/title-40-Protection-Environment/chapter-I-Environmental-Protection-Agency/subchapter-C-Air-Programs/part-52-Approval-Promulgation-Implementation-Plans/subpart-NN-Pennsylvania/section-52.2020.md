Where air quality models are used to meet the provisions of this section, modeling shall be based on the applicable models and other requirements specified in 40 CFR Part 51 Appendix W (Guideline on Air Quality Models). Where an air quality model is inappropriate, the model may be modified or another model may be substituted only on a case-by-case basis at the Department's discretion upon written approval by the administrator of EPA. In addition, use of a modified or substituted model must be subject to notice and opportunity for public comment under procedures set forth in 40 CFR 51.102.”|
