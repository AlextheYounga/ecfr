(g) *Monitoring of NO*X emissions. (1) In determining the Facility-wide 30-Day Rolling Average NOX Emission Rate, the Facility shall use CEMS in accordance with the procedures of 40 CFR parts 60 and 75, appendix F, Procedure 1.

(2) For purposes of calculating the Unit-specific Daily NOX Mass Emissions Limits, the Facility shall use CEMS in accordance with the procedures at 40 CFR part 75. Emissions rates, mass emissions, and other quantitative standards set by or under this section must be met to the number of significant digits in which the standard or limit is expressed. For example, an Emission Rate of 0.100 is not met if the actual Emission Rate is 0.101. The Facility shall round the fourth significant digit to the nearest third significant digit, or the sixth significant digit to the nearest fifth significant digit, depending upon whether the limit is expressed to three or five significant digits. For example, if an actual emission rate is 0.1004, that shall be reported as 0.100, and shall be in compliance with an emission rate of 0.100, and if an actual emission rate is 0.1005, that shall be reported as 0.101, and shall not be in compliance with an emission eate of 0.100. The Facility shall report data to the number of significant digits in which the standard or limit is expressed.

(h) *Recordkeeping and periodic peporting.* (1) The Facility shall electronically submit to EPA a periodic report, within thirty (30) Days after the end of each six-month reporting period (January through June, July through December in each calendar year). The portion of the periodic report containing the data required to be reported by this paragraph (h) shall be in an unlocked electronic spreadsheet format, such as Excel or other widely-used software, and contain data for each Operating Day during the reporting period, including, but not limited to: Facility ID (ORISPL); Facility name; Unit ID; Date; Unit-specific total Daily Operating Time (hours); Unit-specific Daily NOX Mass Emissions (lbs); Unit-specific total Daily Heat Input (MMBtu); Unit-specific Daily NOX Emission Rate (lb/MMBtu); Facility-wide 30-Day Rolling Average NOX Emission Rate (lb/MMBtu); Owner; Operator; Representative (Primary); and Representative (Secondary). In addition, the Facility shall maintain the following information for 5 years from the date of creation of the data and make such information available to EPA if requested: Unit-specific hourly heat input, Unit-specific hourly ammonia injection amounts, and Unit-specific hourly NOX emission rate.

(2) In any periodic report submitted pursuant to this section, the Facility may incorporate by reference information previously submitted to EPA under its Title V permitting requirements, so long as that information is adequate to determine compliance with the emission limits and in the same electronic format as required for the periodic report, and provided that the Facility attaches the Title V Permit report (or the pertinent portions of such report) and provides a specific reference to the provisions of the Title V Permit report that are responsive to the information required in the periodic report.

(3) In addition to the reports required pursuant to this section, if the Facility exceeds the Facility-wide 30-day rolling average NOX emission limit on three or more days during any 30-day period, or exceeds the Unit-specific daily mass emission limit for any Unit on three or more days during any 30-day period, the Facility shall electronically submit to EPA a report on the exceedances within ten (10) business days after the Facility knew or should have known of the event. In the report, the Facility shall explain the cause or causes of the exceedances and any measures taken or to be taken to cure the reported exceedances or to prevent such exceedances in the future. If, at any time, the provisions of this section are included in Title V Permits, consistent with the requirements for such inclusion in this section, then the deviation reports required under applicable Title V regulations shall be deemed to satisfy all the requirements of this paragraph (h)(3).

(4) Each report shall be signed by the Responsible Official as defined in Title V of the Clean Air Act, or his or her equivalent or designee of at least the rank of Vice President. The signatory shall also electronically submit the following certification, which may be contained in a separate document:

“This information was prepared either by me or under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information submitted. Based on my evaluation, or the direction and my inquiry of the person(s) who manage the system, or the person(s) directly responsible for gathering the information, I hereby certify under penalty of law that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this information is true, accurate, and complete. I understand that there are significant penalties for submitting false, inaccurate, or incomplete information to the United States.”

(5) Whenever notifications, submissions, or communications are required by this section, they shall be made electronically to the attention of the Air Enforcement Manager via email to the following address: *R3\_ORC\_mailbox@epa.gov.*
