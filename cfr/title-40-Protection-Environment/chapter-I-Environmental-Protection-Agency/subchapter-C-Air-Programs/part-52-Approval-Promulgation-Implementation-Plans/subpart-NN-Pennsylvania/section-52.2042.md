##### § 52.2042 Visibility protection. #####

(a) *Regional Haze.* The requirements of section 169A of the Clean Air Act are not met because the regional haze plan submitted by Pennsylvania on December 20, 2010, does not include fully approvable measures for meeting the requirements of 40 CFR 51.308(d)(3) and 51.308(e) with respect to emissions of NOX and SO2 from electric generating units. EPA has given limited approval and limited disapproval to the plan provisions addressing these requirements.

(b) *Measures Addressing Limited Disapproval Associated With NO*X. The deficiencies associated with NOX identified in EPA's limited disapproval of the regional haze plan submitted by Pennsylvania on December 20, 2010, are satisfied § 52.2040.

(c) *Measures Addressing Limited Disapproval Associated With SO*2. The deficiencies associated with SO2 identified in EPA's limited disapproval of the regional haze plan submitted by Pennsylvania on December 20, 2010, are satisfied by § 52.2041.
