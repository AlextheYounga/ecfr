(d) Determination of Clean Data. EPA has determined, as of September 25, 2009, the Johnstown (Cambria and Indiana Counties), Lancaster (Lancaster County), Reading (Berks County) and York (York County), Pennsylvania nonattainment areas have clean data for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 52.1004(c), suspends the requirements for these areas to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as these areas continue to meet the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.

(e) *Determination of Clean Data.* EPA has determined, as of March 29, 2012, that based on 2008 to 2010 ambient air quality data, the Harrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle-York, Allentown, Johnstown, and Lancaster nonattainment areas have attained the 24-hour 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS. These determinations, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspend the requirements for these areas to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as these areas continue to meet the 24-hour 2006 PM2.5 NAAQS.
