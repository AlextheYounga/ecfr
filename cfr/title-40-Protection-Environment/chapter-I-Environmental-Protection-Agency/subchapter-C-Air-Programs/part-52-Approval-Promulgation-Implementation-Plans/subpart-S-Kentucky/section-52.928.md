The revised SO2 emission limit for large coal-fired boilers in Bell, Clark, and Woodford Counties, submitted on June 29, 1979, is disapproved since it does not provide for attainment and maintenance of all SO2 NAAQS. The limit approved by EPA on May 10, 1976 (41 FR 19105), remains the limit applicable to these sources.
