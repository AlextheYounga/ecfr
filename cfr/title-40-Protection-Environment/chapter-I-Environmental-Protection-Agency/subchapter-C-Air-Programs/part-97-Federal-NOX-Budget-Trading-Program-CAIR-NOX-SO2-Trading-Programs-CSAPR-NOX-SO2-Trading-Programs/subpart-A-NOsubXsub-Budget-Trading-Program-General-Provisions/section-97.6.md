Except with regard to the requirements applicable to units with a common stack under subpart H of this part, the owners and operators and the NOX authorized account representative of one NOX Budget unit shall not be liable for any violation by any other NOX Budget unit of which they are not owners or operators or the NOX authorized account representative and that is located at a source of which they are not owners or operators or the NOX authorized account representative.
