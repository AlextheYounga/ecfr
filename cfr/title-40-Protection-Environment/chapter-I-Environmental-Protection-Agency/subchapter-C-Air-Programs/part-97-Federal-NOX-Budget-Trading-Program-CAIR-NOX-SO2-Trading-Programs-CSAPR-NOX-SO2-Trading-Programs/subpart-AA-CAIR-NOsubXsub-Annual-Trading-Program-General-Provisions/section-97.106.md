(b) *Monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements.* (1) The owners and operators, and the CAIR designated representative, of each CAIR NOX source and each CAIR NOX unit at the source shall comply with the monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements of subpart HH of this part.

(2) The emissions measurements recorded and reported in accordance with subpart HH of this part shall be used to determine compliance by each CAIR NOX source with the CAIR NOX emissions limitation under paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) *Nitrogen oxides emission requirements.* (1) As of the allowance transfer deadline for a control period, the owners and operators of each CAIR NOX source and each CAIR NOX unit at the source shall hold, in the source's compliance account, CAIR NOX allowances available for compliance deductions for the control period under § 97.154(a) in an amount not less than the tons of total nitrogen oxides emissions for the control period from all CAIR NOX units at the source, as determined in accordance with subpart HH of this part.

(2) A CAIR NOX unit shall be subject to the requirements under paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the control period starting on the later of January 1, 2009 or the deadline for meeting the unit's monitor certification requirements under § 97.170(b)(1), (2), or (5) and for each control period thereafter.
