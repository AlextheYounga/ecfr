##### § 51.1103 Application of classification and attainment date provisions in CAA section 181 to areas subject to § 51.1102. #####

(a) In accordance with CAA section 181(a)(1), each area designated nonattainment for the 2008 ozone NAAQS shall be classified by operation of law at the time of designation. The classification shall be based on the 8-hour design value for the area at the time of designation, in accordance with Table 1 below. A state may request a higher or lower classification as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. For each area classified under this section, the attainment date for the 2008 NAAQS shall be as expeditious as practicable but not later than the date provided in Table 1 as follows:

|     Area class     |                 |8-hour design value (ppm ozone)|Primary standard attainment date (years after the  <br/>effective date of designation for 2008 primary NAAQS)|
