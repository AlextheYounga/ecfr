##### § 98.453 Calculating GHG emissions. #####

(a) For each electrical equipment manufacturer or refurbisher, estimate the annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG that is a component of any reportable insulating gas using the mass-balance approach in equation SS-3 to this section:

![](/graphics/er25ap24.061.gif)Where:User emissionsi = Annual emissions of each fluorinated GHG i (pounds).GHGi,w = The weight fraction of fluorinated GHG i in reportable insulating gas j if insulating gas j is a gas mixture, expressed as a decimal fraction. If fluorinated GHG i is not part of a gas mixture, use a value of 1.0.Decrease in Inventory of Reportable Insulating Gas j Inventory = (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j stored in containers at the beginning of the year)—(Pounds of reportable insulating gas j stored in containers at the end of the year).Acquisitions of Reportable Insulating Gas j = (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j purchased from chemical producers or suppliers in bulk) + (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j returned by equipment users) + (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j returned to site after off-site recycling).Disbursements of Reportable Insulating Gas j = (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j contained in new equipment delivered to customers) + (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j delivered to equipment users in containers) + (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j returned to suppliers) + (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j sent off site for recycling) + (Pounds of reportable insulating gas j sent off-site for destruction).

(b) [Reserved]

(c) Estimate the disbursements of reportable insulating gas j sent to customers in new equipment or cylinders or sent off-site for other purposes including for recycling, for destruction or to be returned to suppliers using equation SS-4 to this section:

![](/graphics/er25ap24.062.gif)Where:DGHG = The annual disbursement of reportable insulating gas j sent to customers in new equipment or cylinders or sent off-site for other purposes including for recycling, for destruction or to be returned to suppliers.Qp = The mass of reportable insulating gas j charged into equipment or containers over the period p sent to customers or sent off-site for other purposes including for recycling, for destruction or to be returned to suppliers.n = The number of periods in the year.

(d) Estimate the mass of each insulating gas j disbursed to customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p by monitoring the mass flow of each insulating gas j into the new equipment or cylinders using a flowmeter, or by weighing containers before and after gas from containers is used to fill equipment or cylinders, or by using the nameplate capacity of the equipment.

(e) If the mass of insulating gas j disbursed to customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p is estimated by weighing containers before and after gas from containers is used to fill equipment or cylinders, estimate this quantity using equation SS-5 to this section:

![](/graphics/er25ap24.063.gif)Where:Qp = The mass of insulating gas j charged into equipment or containers over the period p sent to customers or sent off-site for other purposes including for recycling, for destruction or to be returned to suppliers.MB = The mass of the contents of the containers used to fill equipment or cylinders at the beginning of period p.ME = The mass of the contents of the containers used to fill equipment or cylinders at the end of period p.EL = The mass of insulating gas j emitted during the period p downstream of the containers used to fill equipment or cylinders and in cases where a flowmeter is used, downstream of the flowmeter during the period p (*e.g.,* emissions from hoses or other flow lines that connect the container to the equipment or cylinder that is being filled).

(f) If the mass of insulating gas j disbursed to customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p is determined using a flowmeter, estimate this quantity using equation SS-6 to this section:

![](/graphics/er25ap24.064.gif)Where:Qp = The mass of insulating gas j charged into equipment or containers over the period p sent to customers or sent off-site for other purposes including for recycling, for destruction or to be returned to suppliers.Mmr = The mass of insulating gas j that has flowed through the flowmeter during the period p.EL = The mass of insulating gas j emitted during the period p downstream of the containers used to fill equipment or cylinders and in cases where a flowmeter is used, downstream of the flowmeter during the period p (*e.g.,* emissions from hoses or other flow lines that connect the container to the equipment that is being filled).

(g) Estimate the mass of insulating gas j emitted during the period p downstream of the containers used to fill equipment or cylinders (*e.g.,* emissions from hoses or other flow lines that connect the container to the equipment or cylinder that is being filled) using equation SS-7 to this section:

![](/graphics/er25ap24.065.gif)Where:EL = The mass of insulating gas j emitted during the period p downstream of the containers used to fill equipment or cylinders and in cases where a flowmeter is used, downstream of the flowmeter during the period p (*e.g.,* emissions from hoses or other flow lines that connect the container to the equipment or cylinder that is being filled).FCi = The total number of fill operations over the period p for the valve-hose combination Ci.EFCi = The emission factor for the valve-hose combination Ci.n=The number of different valve-hose combinations C used during the period p.

(h) If the mass of insulating gas j disbursed to customers in new equipment or cylinders over the period p is determined by using the nameplate capacity, or by using the nameplate capacity of the equipment and calculating the partial shipping charge, use the methods in either paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section.

(1) Determine the equipment's actual nameplate capacity, by measuring the nameplate capacities of a representative sample of each make and model and calculating the mean value for each make and model as specified at § 98.454(f).

(2) If equipment is shipped with a partial charge, calculate the partial shipping charge by multiplying the nameplate capacity of the equipment by the ratio of the densities of the partial charge to the full charge.

(i) Estimate the annual emissions of reportable insulating gas j from the equipment that is installed at an off-site electric power transmission or distribution location before the title to the equipment is transferred by using equation SS-8 to this section:

![](/graphics/er25ap24.066.gif)Where:EI = Total annual emissions of reportable insulating gas j from equipment installation at electric transmission or distribution facilities.GHGi,w = The weight fraction of fluorinated GHG i in reportable insulating gas j if reportable insulating gas j is a gas mixture, expressed as a decimal fraction. If the GHG i is not part of a gas mixture, use a value of 1.0.MF = The total annual mass of reportable insulating gas j, in pounds, used to fill equipment during equipment installation at electric transmission or distribution facilities.MC = The total annual mass of reportable insulating gas j, in pounds, used to charge the equipment prior to leaving the electrical equipment manufacturer facility.NI = The total annual nameplate capacity of the equipment, in pounds, installed at electric transmission or distribution facilities.
