##### § 98.313 Calculating GHG emissions. #####

You must calculate and report the annual process CO2 emissions for each chloride process line using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the process CO2 emissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) Calculate and report under this subpart the annual process CO2 emissions for each chloride process line by determining the mass of calcined petroleum coke consumed in each line as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(3) of this section. Use Equation EE-1 of this section to calulate annual combined process CO2 emissions from all process lines and use Equation EE-2 of this section to calculate annual process CO2 emissions for each process line. If your facility generates carbon-containing waste, use Equation EE-3 of this section to estimate the annual quantity of carbon-containing waste generated and its carbon contents according to § 98.314(e) and (f):

(1) You must calculate the annual CO2 process emissions from all process lines at the facility using Equation EE-1 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.123.gif)Where:CO2 = Annual CO2 emissions from titanium dioxide production facility (metric tons/year).Ep = Annual CO2 emissions from chloride process line p (metric tons), determined using Equation EE-2 of this section.p = Process line.m = Number of separate chloride process lines located at the facility.

(2) You must calculate the annual CO2 process emissions from each process lines at the facility using Equation EE-2 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.124.gif)Where:Ep = Annual CO2 mass emissions from chloride process line p (metric tons).Cp,n = Calcined petroleum coke consumption for process line p in month n (tons).44/12 = Ratio of molecular weights, CO2 to carbon.2000/2205 = Conversion of tons to metric tons.CCFn = Carbon content factor for petroleum coke consumed in month n from the supplier or as measured by the applicable method incorporated by reference in § 98.7 according to § 98.314(c) (percent by weight expressed as a decimal fraction).n = Number of month.

(3) If facility generates carbon-containing waste, you must calculate the total annual quantity of carbon-containing waste produced from all process lines using Equation EE-3 of this section and its carbon contents according to § 98.314(e) and (f):

![](/graphics/er30oc09.125.gif)Where:TWC = Annual production of carbon-containing waste from titanium dioxide production facility (tons).WCp,n = Production of carbon-containing waste in month n from chloride process line p (tons).p = Process line.m = Total number of process lines.n = Number of month.

(c) If GHG emissions from a chloride process line are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process CO2 emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.
