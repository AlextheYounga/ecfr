##### ยง 98.420 Definition of the source category. #####

(a) The carbon dioxide (CO2) supplier source category consists of the following:

(1) Facilities with production process units that capture a CO2 stream for purposes of supplying CO2 for commercial applications or that capture and maintain custody of a CO2 stream in order to sequester or otherwise inject it underground. Capture refers to the initial separation and removal of CO2 from a manufacturing process or any other process.

(2) Facilities with CO2 production wells that extract or produce a CO2 stream for purposes of supplying CO2 for commercial applications or that extract and maintain custody of a CO2 stream in order to sequester or otherwise inject it underground.

(3) Importers or exporters of bulk CO2.

(4) Facilities with process units, including but not limited to direct air capture (DAC), that capture a CO2 stream from ambient air for purposes of supplying CO2 for commercial applications or that capture and maintain custody of a CO2 stream in order to sequester or otherwise inject it underground.

(b) This source category is focused on upstream supply. It does not cover:

(1) Storage of CO2 above ground or in geologic formations.

(2) Use of CO2 in enhanced oil and gas recovery.

(3) Transportation or distribution of CO2.

(4) Purification, compression, or processing of CO2.

(5) On-site use of CO2 captured on site.

(c) This source category does not include CO2 imported or exported in equipment, such as fire extinguishers.
