(d) Calculate and report under this subpart the process CO2 emissions by operating and maintaining CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(e) Use the following procedures to calculate CO2 emissions from anode consumption during electrolysis:

(1) For Prebake cells: you must calculate CO2 emissions from anode consumption using Equation F-5 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.029.gif)Where:ECO2 = Annual CO2 emissions from prebaked anode consumption (metric tons CO2).NAC = Net annual prebaked anode consumption per metric ton Al (metric tons C/metric tons Al).MP = Annual metal production (metric tons Al).Sa = Sulfur content in baked anode (percent weight).Asha = Ash content in baked anode (percent weight).44/12 = Ratio of molecular weights, CO2 to carbon.

(2) For Søderberg cells you must calculate CO2 emissions using Equation F-6 of this section:

(f) Use the following procedures to calculate CO2 emissions from anode baking of prebake cells:

(1) Use Equation F-7 of this section to calculate emissions from pitch volatiles combustion.

![](/graphics/er30oc09.031.gif)Where:ECO2PV = Annual CO2 emissions from pitch volatiles combustion (metric tons CO2).GA = Initial weight of green anodes (metric tons).Hw = Annual hydrogen content in green anodes (metric tons).BA = Annual baked anode production (metric tons).WT = Annual waste tar collected (metric tons).44/12 = Ratio of molecular weights, CO2 to carbon.

(2) Use Equation F-8 of this section to calculate emissions from bake furnace packing material.

![](/graphics/er30oc09.032.gif)Where:ECO2PC = Annual CO2 emissions from bake furnace packing material (metric tons CO2).PCC = Annual packing coke consumption (metric tons/metric ton baked anode).BA = Annual baked anode production (metric tons).Spc = Sulfur content in packing coke (percent weight).Ashpc = Ash content in packing coke (percent weight).44/12 = Ratio of molecular weights, CO2 to carbon.

(g) If process CO2 emissions from anode consumption during electrolysis or anode baking of prebake cells are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall not be used to calculate those process emissions. The owner or operation shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).
