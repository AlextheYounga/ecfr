##### § 98.413 Calculating GHG emissions. #####

(a) Calculate the total mass of the nitrous oxide and each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF produced annually, except for amounts that are captured solely to be shipped off site for destruction, by using Equation OO-1 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.171.gif)P = Mass of fluorinated GHG, fluorinated HTF, or nitrous oxide produced annually.Pp = Mass of fluorinated GHG, fluorinated HTF, or nitrous oxide produced over the period “p”.

(b) Calculate the total mass of the nitrous oxide and each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF produced over the period “p” by using Equation OO-2 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.172.gif)Where:Pp = Mass of fluorinated GHG, fluorinated HTF, or nitrous oxide produced over the period “p” (metric tons).Op = Mass of fluorinated GHG, fluorinated HTF, or nitrous oxide that is measured coming out of the production process over the period p (metric tons).Up = Mass of used fluorinated GHG, fluorinated HTF, or nitrous oxide that is added to the production process upstream of the output measurement over the period “p” (metric tons).

(c) Calculate the total mass of the nitrous oxide and each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF transformed by using Equation OO-3 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.173.gif)Where:T = Mass of fluorinated GHG, fluorinated HTF, or nitrous oxide transformed annually (metric tons).FT = Mass of fluorinated GHG fed into the transformation process annually (metric tons).ET = The fraction of the fluorinated GHG, fluorinated HTF, or nitrous oxide fed into the transformation process that is transformed in the process (metric tons).

(d) Calculate the total mass of each fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF destroyed by using Equation OO-4 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.174.gif)Where:D = Mass of fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF destroyed annually (metric tons).FD = Mass of fluorinated GHG or fluorinated HTF fed into the destruction device annually (metric tons).DE = Destruction efficiency of the destruction device (fraction).[74 FR 56374, Oct. 30, 2009, as amended at 81 FR 89270, Dec. 9, 2016]
