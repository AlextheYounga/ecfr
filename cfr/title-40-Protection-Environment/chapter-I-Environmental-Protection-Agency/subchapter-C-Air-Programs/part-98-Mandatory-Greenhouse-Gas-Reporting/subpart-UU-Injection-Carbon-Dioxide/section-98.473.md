##### § 98.473 Calculating CO2 received. #####

(a) You must calculate and report the annual mass of CO2 received by pipeline using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section and the procedures in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, if applicable.

(1) For a mass flow meter, you must calculate the total annual mass of CO2 in a CO2 stream received in metric tons by multiplying the mass flow by the CO2 concentration in the flow, according to Equation UU-1 of this section. You must collect these data quarterly. Mass flow and concentration data measurements must be made in accordance with § 98.474.

(2) For a volumetric flow meter, you must calculate the total annual mass of CO2 in a CO2 stream received in metric tons by multiplying the volumetric flow at standard conditions by the CO2 concentration in the flow and the density of CO2 at standard conditions, according to Equation UU-2 of this section. You must collect these data quarterly. Volumetric flow and concentration data measurements must be made in accordance with § 98.474.

(3) If you receive CO2 through more than one flow meter, you must sum the mass of all CO2 received in accordance with the procedure specified in Equation UU-3 of this section.

(b) You must calculate and report the annual mass of CO2 received in containers using the procedures specified in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.

(1) If you are measuring the mass of contents in a container under the provisions of § 98.474(a)(2)(i), you must calculate the CO2 received in containers using Equation UU-1 of this section.

where:CO2T,r = Annual mass of CO2 received in containers r (metric tons).CCO2,p,r = Quarterly CO2 concentration measurement of contents in containers r in quarter p (wt. percent CO2, expressed as a decimal fraction).Qr,p = Quarterly mass of contents in containers r in quarter p (metric tons).Sr,p = Quarterly mass of contents in containers r that is redelivered to another facility without being injected into your well in quarter p (standard cubic meters).p = Quarter of the year.r = Containers.

(2) If you are measuring the volume of contents in a container under the provisions of § 98.474(a)(2)(ii), you must calculate the CO2 received in containers using Equation UU-2 of this section.

where:CO2T,r = Annual mass of CO2 received in containers r (metric tons).CCO2,p,r = Quarterly CO2 concentration measurement of contents in containers r in quarter p (vol. percent CO2, expressed as a decimal fraction).Sr,p = Quarterly volume of contents in containers r that is redelivered to another facility without being injected into your well in quarter p (standard cubic meters).Qr,p = Quarterly volume of contents in containers r in quarter p (standard cubic meters).D = Density of the CO2 received in containers at standard conditions (metric tons per standard cubic meter): 0.0018682.p = Quarter of the year.r = Containers.[75 FR 75078, Dec. 1, 2010, as amended at 78 FR 71981, Nov. 29, 2013]
