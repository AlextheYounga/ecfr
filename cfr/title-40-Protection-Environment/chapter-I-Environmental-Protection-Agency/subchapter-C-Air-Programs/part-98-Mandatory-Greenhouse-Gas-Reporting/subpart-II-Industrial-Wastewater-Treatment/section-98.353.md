(a) For each anaerobic reactor and anaerobic lagoon, estimate the annual mass of CH4 generated according to the applicable requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(2) of this section.

(1) If you measure the concentration of organic material entering the anaerobic reactors or anaerobic lagoon using methods for the determination of chemical oxygen demand (COD), then estimate annual mass of CH4 generated using Equation II-1 of this section.

(b) For each anaerobic reactor and anaerobic lagoon from which biogas is not recovered, estimate annual CH4 emissions using Equation II-3 of this section.

(c) For each anaerobic sludge digester, anaerobic reactor, or anaerobic lagoon from which some biogas is recovered, estimate the annual mass of CH4 recovered according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. To estimate the annual mass of CH4 recovered, you must continuously monitor biogas flow rate and determine the volume of biogas each week and the cumulative volume of biogas each year that is collected and routed to a destruction device as specified in § 98.354(h). If the gas flow meter is not equipped with automatic correction for temperature, pressure, or, if necessary, moisture content, you must determine these parameters as specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.

(1) If you continuously monitor CH4 concentration (and if necessary, temperature, pressure, and moisture content required as specified in § 98.354(f)) of the biogas that is collected and routed to a destruction device using a monitoring meter specifically for CH4 gas, as specified in § 98.354(g), you must use this monitoring system and calculate the quantity of CH4 recovered for destruction using Equation II-4 of this section. A fully integrated system that directly reports CH4 quantity requires only the summing of results of all monitoring periods for a given year.

Use M = 52 for weekly sampling, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)of this section.m = Index for measurement period.Vm = Cumulative volumetric flow for the measurement period in actual cubic feet (acf). If no biogas was recovered during a monitoring period, use zero.(KMC)m = Moisture correction term for the measurement period, volumetric basis.= 1 when (V)m and (CCH4)m are measured on a dry basis or if both are measured on a wet basis.= 1−(fH2O)m when (V)m is measured on a wet basis and (CCH4)m is measured on a dry basis.= 1/[1−(fH2O)m] when (V)m is measured on a dry basis and (CCH4)m is measured on a wet basis.(fH2O)m = Average moisture content of biogas during the measurment period, volumetric basis, (cubic feet water per cubic feet biogas).(CCH4)m = Average CH4 concentration of biogas during the measurement period, (volume %).0.0423 = Density of CH4 lb/cf at 520 °R or 60 °F and 1 atm.520 °R = 520 degrees Rankine.Tm = Average temperature at which flow is measured for the measurement period (°R). If the flow rate meter automatically corrects for temperature to 520° R, replace “520° R/Tm” with “1”.Pm = Average pressure at which flow is measured for the measurement period (atm). If the flow rate meter automatically corrects for pressure to 1 atm, replace “Pm/1” with “1”.0.454/1,000 = Conversion factor (metric ton/lb).

(2) If you do not continuously monitor CH4 concentration according to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you must determine the CH4 concentration, temperature, pressure, and, if necessary, moisture content of the biogas that is collected and routed to a destruction device according to the requirements in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (c)(2)(ii) of this section and calculate the quantity of CH4 recovered for destruction using Equation II-4 of this section.

(i) Determine the CH4 concentration in the biogas that is collected and routed to a destruction device in a location near or representative of the location of the gas flow meter at least once each calendar week; if only one measurement is made each calendar week, there must be least three days between measurements. For a given calendar week, you are not required to determine CH4 concentration if the cumulative volume of biogas for that calendar week, determined as specified in paragraph (c) of this section, is zero.

(ii) If the gas flow meter is not equipped with automatic correction for temperature, pressure, or, if necessary, moisture content:

(A) Determine the temperature and pressure in the biogas that is collected and routed to a destruction device in a location near or representative of the location of the gas flow meter at least once each calendar week; if only one measurement is made each calendar week, there must be at least three days between measurements.

(B) If the CH4 concentration is determined on a dry basis and biogas flow is determined on a wet basis, or CH4 concentration is determined on a wet basis and biogas flow is determined on a dry basis, and the flow meter does not automatically correct for moisture content, determine the moisture content in the biogas that is collected and routed to a destruction device in a location near or representative of the location of the gas flow meter at least once each calendar week that the cumulative biogas flow measured as specified in § 98.354(h) is greater than zero; if only one measurement is made each calendar week, there must be at least three days between measurements.

(d) For each anaerobic sludge digester, anaerobic reactor, or anaerobic lagoon from which some quantity of biogas is recovered, you must estimate both the annual mass of CH4 that is generated, but not recovered, according to paragraph (d)(1) of this section and the annual mass of CH4 emitted according to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
