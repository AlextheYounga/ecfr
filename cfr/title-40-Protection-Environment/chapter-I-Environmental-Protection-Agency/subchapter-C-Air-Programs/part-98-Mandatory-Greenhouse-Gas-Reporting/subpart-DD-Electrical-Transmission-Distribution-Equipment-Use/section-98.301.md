##### ยง 98.301 Reporting threshold. #####

(a) You must report GHG emissions under this subpart if you are an electric power system as defined in ยง 98.308 and your facility meets the requirements of ยง 98.2(a)(1). To calculate total annual GHG emissions for comparison to the 25,000 metric ton CO2e per year emission threshold in table A-3 to subpart A to this part, you must calculate emissions of each fluorinated GHG that is a component of a reportable insulating gas and then sum the emissions of each fluorinated GHG resulting from the use of electrical transmission and distribution equipment for threshold applicability purposes using equation DD-1 to this section.

If fluorinated GHG i is not part of a gas mixture, use a value of 1.0.GWPi = Gas-appropriate GWP as provided in table A-1 to subpart A of this part.EF = Emission factor for electrical transmission and distribution equipment (lbs emitted/lbs nameplate capacity). For all gases, use an emission factor or 0.1.i = Fluorinated GHG contained in the electrical transmission and distribution equipment.0.000453592 = Conversion factor from lbs to metric tons.

(b) A facility other than an electric power system that is subject to this part because of emissions from any other source category listed in table A-3 or A-4 to subpart A of this part is not required to report emissions under subpart DD of this part unless the total estimated emissions of fluorinated GHGs that are components of reportable insulating gases, as calculated in equation DD-2 to this section, equals or exceeds 25,000 tons CO2e.
