(vii) When using the stack testing method described in this paragraph (i), you must calculate abatement system uptime on a fab basis using equation I-23 to this section. When calculating abatement system uptime for use in equation I-19 and I-20 to this section, you must evaluate the variables “Tdpf” and “UTpf” for the sampling period instead of the reporting year.

![](/graphics/er25ap24.029.gif)Where:UTf = The average uptime factor for all abatement systems in fab f (expressed as a decimal fraction). The average uptime factor may be set to one (1) if all the abatement systems in fab f are interlocked with all the tools feeding the abatement systems such that no gas can flow to the tools if the abatement systems are not in operational mode.Tdpf = The total time, in minutes, that abatement system p, connected to process tool(s) in fab f, is not in operational mode as defined in § 98.98. If your fab uses redundant abatement systems, you may account for Tdpf as specified in § 98.94(f)(4)(vi).UTpf = Total time, in minutes per year, in which the tool(s) connected at any point during the year to abatement system p, in fab f could be in operation. For determining the amount of tool operating time, you may assume that tools that were installed for the whole of the year were operated for 525,600 minutes per year. For tools that were installed or uninstalled during the year, you must prorate the operating time to account for the days in which the tool was not installed; treat any partial day that a tool was installed as a full day (1,440 minutes) of tool operation. For an abatement system that has more than one connected tool, the tool operating time is 525,600 minutes per year if there was at least one tool installed at all times throughout the year. If you have tools that are idle with no gas flow through the tool, you may calculate total tool time using the actual time that gas is flowing through the tool.f = Fab.p = Abatement system.

(viii) When using the stack testing option described in this paragraph (i) and when using more than one DRE for the same input gas i or by-product gas k, you must calculate the weighted-average fraction of each fluorinated input gas i and each fluorinated by-product gas k that has more than one DRE and that is destroyed or removed in abatement systems for each fab f, as applicable, by using equation I-24A to this section (for input gases) and equation I-24B to this section (for by-product gases) and table I-18 to this subpart.

(ix) When using the stack testing method described in this paragraph (i), you must calculate the fraction each fluorinated input gas i exhausted in fab f from tools with abatement systems and the fraction of each by-product gas k exhausted from tools with abatement systems, as applicable, by following either the procedure set forth in paragraph (i)(3)(ix)(A) of this section or the procedure set forth in paragraph (i)(3)(ix)(B) of this section.

(A) Use equation I-24C to this section (for input gases) and equation I-24D to this section (for by-product gases) and table I-18 to this subpart. If default values are not available in table I-18 for a particular input gas, you must use a value of 10.

There is one process type q that consists of the combination of etching and/or wafer cleaning processes.

(B) Use paragraph (e) of this section to apportion consumption of gas i either to tools with abatement systems and tools without abatement systems or to each process type or sub-type, as applicable. If you apportion consumption of gas i to each process type or sub-type, calculate the fractions of input gas i and by-product gas k formed from gas i that are exhausted from tools with abatement systems based on the numbers of tools with and without abatement systems within each process type or sub-type.

(4) *Method to calculate emissions from fluorinated GHGs that are not tested.* Calculate emissions from consumption of each intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG as defined in § 98.98 of this subpart using the default utilization and by-product formation rates provided in table I-11, I-12, I-13, I-14, or I-15 to this subpart, as applicable, and by using equations I-8A, I-8B, I-9, and I-13 to this section. If a fluorinated GHG was not being used during the stack testing and does not meet the definition of intermittent low-use fluorinated GHG in § 98.98, then you must test the stack systems associated with the use of that fluorinated GHG at a time when that gas is in use at a magnitude that would allow you to determine an emission factor for that gas according to the procedures specified in paragraph (i)(3) of this section.
