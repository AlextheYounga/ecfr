##### § 98.113 Calculating GHG emissions. #####

You must calculate and report the annual process CO2 emissions from each EAF not subject to paragraph (c) of this section using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section. For each EAF also subject to annual process CH4 emissions reporting, you must also calculate and report the annual process CH4 emissions from the EAF using the procedures in paragraph (d) of this section.

(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the process CO2 emissions by operating and maintaining CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) Calculate and report under this subpart the annual process CO2 emissions using the procedure in either paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section.

(1) Calculate and report under this subpart the annual process CO2 emissions from EAFs by operating and maintaining a CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in § 98.33(a)(4) and the applicable requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(2) Calculate and report under this subpart the annual process CO2 emissions from the EAFs using the carbon mass balance procedure specified in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii) of this section.

(i) For each EAF, determine the annual mass of carbon in each carbon-containing input and output material for the EAF and estimate annual process CO2 emissions from the EAF using Equation K-1 of this section. Carbon-containing input materials include carbon electrodes and carbonaceous reducing agents. If you document that a specific input or output material contributes less than 1 percent of the total carbon into or out of the process, you do not have to include the material in your calculation using Equation K-1 of this section.

(ii) Determine the combined annual process CO2 emissions from the EAFs at your facility using Equation K-2 of this section.

(c) If GHG emissions from an EAF are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.

(d) For the EAFs at your facility used for the production of any ferroalloy listed in Table K-1 of this subpart, you must calculate and report the annual CH4 emissions using the procedure specified in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) For each EAF, determine the annual CH4 emissions using Equation K-3 of this section.

(2) Determine the combined process CH4 emissions from the EAFs at your facility using Equation K-4 of this section:
