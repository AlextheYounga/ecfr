You must determine CO2 process emissions from carbonate use in accordance with the procedures specified in either paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section.

(a) Calculate the process emissions of CO2 using calcination fractions with Equation U-1 of this section.

![](/graphics/er30oc09.077.gif)Where:ECO2 = Annual CO2 mass emissions from consumption of carbonates (metric tons).Mi = Annual mass of carbonate type i consumed (tons).EFi = Emission factor for the carbonate type i, as specified in Table U-1 to this subpart, metric tons CO2/metric ton carbonate consumed.Fi = Fraction calcination achieved for each particular carbonate type i (decimal fraction). As an alternative to measuring the calcination fraction, a value of 1.0 can be used.n = Number of carbonate types.2000/2205 = Conversion factor to convert tons to metric tons.(b) Calculate the process emissions of CO2 using actual mass of output carbonates with Equation U-2 of this section.![](/graphics/er30oc09.078.gif)Where:ECO2 = Annual CO2 mass emissions from consumption of carbonates (metric tons).Mk = Annual mass of input carbonate type k (tons).EFk = Emission factor for the carbonate type k, as specified in Table U-1 of this subpart (metric tons CO2/metric ton carbonate input).Mj = Annual mass of output carbonate type j (tons).EFj = Emission factor for the output carbonate type j, as specified in Table U-1 of this subpart (metric tons CO2/metric ton carbonate input).m = Number of input carbonate types.n = Number of output carbonate types.
