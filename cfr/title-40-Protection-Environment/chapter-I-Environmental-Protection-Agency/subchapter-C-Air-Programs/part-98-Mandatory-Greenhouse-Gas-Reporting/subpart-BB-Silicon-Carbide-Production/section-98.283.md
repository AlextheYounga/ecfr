##### § 98.283 Calculating GHG emissions. #####

You must calculate and report the combined annual process CO2 emissions from all silicon carbide process units and production furnaces using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined annual process CO2 emissions by operating and maintaining CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) Calculate and report under this subpart the combined annual process CO2 emissions using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

(1) Use Equation BB-1 of this section to calculate the facility-specific emissions factor for determining CO2 emissions. The carbon content must be measured monthly and used to calculate a monthly CO2 emissions factor:

(2) Calculate annual CO2 process emissions from the silicon carbide production facility according to Equation BB-2 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.116.gif)Where:CO2 = Annual CO2 emissions from silicon carbide production facility (metric tons CO2).Tn = Petroleum coke consumption in calendar month n (tons).EFCO2,n = CO2 emissions factor from month n (calculated in Equation BB-1 of this section).2000/2205 = Conversion factor to convert tons to metric tons.n = Number of month.

(c) If GHG emissions from a silicon carbide production furnace or process unit are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in § 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.
