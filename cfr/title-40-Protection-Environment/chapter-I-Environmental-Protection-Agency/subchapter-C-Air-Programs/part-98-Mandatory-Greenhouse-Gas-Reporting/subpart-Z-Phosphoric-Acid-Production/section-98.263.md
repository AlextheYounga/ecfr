##### ยง 98.263 Calculating GHG emissions. #####

You must calculate and report the annual process CO2 emissions from each wet-process phosphoric acid process line using the procedures in either paragraph (a) or (b) of this section.

(a) Calculate and report under this subpart the process CO2 emissions by operating and maintaining a CEMS according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology specified in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources).

(b) Calculate and report under this subpart the process CO2 emissions using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section.

(1) Calculate the annual CO2 mass emissions from each wet-process phosphoric acid process line using the methods in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.

(i) If your process measurement provides the inorganic carbon content of phosphate rock as an output, calculate and report the process CO2 emissions from each wet-process phosphoric acid process line using Equation Z-1a of this section:

![](/graphics/er28oc10.031.gif)where:Em = Annual CO2 mass emissions from a wet-process phosphoric acid process line m according to this Equation Z-1a (metric tons).ICn,i = Inorganic carbon content of a grab sample batch of phosphate rock by origin i obtained during month n, from the carbon analysis results (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction).Pn,i = Mass of phosphate rock by origin i consumed in month n by wet-process phosphoric acid process line m (tons).z = Number of months during which the process line m operates.b = Number of different types of phosphate rock in month, by origin. If the grab sample is a composite sample of rock from more than one origin, b = 1.2000/2205 = Conversion factor to convert tons to metric tons.44/12 = Ratio of molecular weights, CO2 to carbon.

(ii) If your process measurement provides the CO2 content directly as an output, calculate and report the process CO2 emissions from each wet-process phosphoric acid process line using Equation Z-1b of this section:

![](/graphics/er28oc10.032.gif)where:Em = Annual CO2 mass emissions from a wet-process phosphoric acid process line m according to this Equation Z-1b (metric tons).CO2n,i = Carbon dioxide content of a grab sample batch of phosphate rock by origin i obtained during month n (percent by weight, expressed as a decimal fraction).Pn,i = Mass of phosphate rock by origin i consumed in month n by wet-process phosphoric acid process line m (tons).z = Number of months during which the process line m operates.b = Number of different types of phosphate rock in month, by origin. If the grab sample is a composite sample of rock from more than one origin, b = 1.2000/2205 = Conversion factor to convert tons to metric tons.

(2) You must determine the total emissions from the facility using Equation Z-2 of this section:

![](/graphics/er30oc09.111.gif)Where:CO2 = Annual process CO2 emissions from phosphoric acid production facility (metric tons/year).Em = Annual process CO2 emissions from wet-process phosphoric acid process line m (metric tons/year).p = Number of wet-process phosphoric acid process lines.

(c) If GHG emissions from a wet-process phosphoric acid process line are vented through the same stack as any combustion unit or process equipment that reports CO2 emissions using a CEMS that complies with the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in subpart C of this part (General Stationary Fuel Combustion Sources), then the calculation methodology in paragraph (b) of this section shall not be used to calculate process emissions. The owner or operator shall report under this subpart the combined stack emissions according to the Tier 4 Calculation Methodology in ยง 98.33(a)(4) and all associated requirements for Tier 4 in subpart C of this part.
