(2) *Sampling site when a halogen reduction device is used prior to a combustion device.* An owner or operator using a scrubber or other halogen reduction device to reduce the process vent halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilogram per hour (0.99 pound per hour) prior to a combustion control device in compliance with § 65.63(b)(2) shall determine the halogen atom mass emission rate prior to the combustor and after the scrubber or other halogen reduction device according to the procedures in paragraph (g) of this section.

(3) *Sampling site selection method.* Method 1 or 1A of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling site. No traverse site selection method is needed for process vents smaller than 0.10 meter (4 inches) in nominal inside diameter.

(c) *TOC or HAP concentration.* The TOC or HAP concentrations used for TRE index value calculations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be determined based on paragraph (c)(1) or (i) of this section, or any other method or data that have been validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63. For concentrations needed for comparison with the appropriate concentration in table 1 of this subpart, TOC or HAP concentration shall be determined based on paragraph (c)(1), (c)(2), or (i) of this section or any other method or data that have been validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63. The owner or operator shall record the TOC or HAP concentration as specified in § 65.66(c).

(1) *Method 18.* The procedures specified in paragraph (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section shall be used to calculate parts per million by volume concentration using Method 18 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60.

(i) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15-minute intervals during the run.

(ii) The concentration of either TOC (minus methane and ethane) or organic HAP emissions shall be calculated using the following two procedures, as applicable.

(A) The TOC concentration (CTOC) is the sum of the concentrations of the individual components and shall be computed for each run using Equation 64-1 of this section:
