##### § 63.150 Emissions averaging provisions. #####

(a) This section applies to owners or operators of existing sources who seek to comply with the emission standard in § 63.112(a) of this subpart by using emissions averaging according to § 63.112(f) of this subpart rather than following the provisions of §§ 63.113 through 63.148 of this subpart. Notwithstanding the definition of process vent in § 63.101 and the sampling site designation in § 63.115(a), for purposes of this section the location of a process vent shall be defined, and the characteristics of its gas stream shall be determined, consistent with paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section.

(b) Unless an operating permit application has been submitted, the owner or operator shall develop and submit for approval an Implementation Plan containing all of the information required in § 63.151(d) of this subpart for all points to be included in an emissions average. The Implementation Plan or operating permit application shall identify all emission points to be included in the emissions average. This must include any Group 1 emission points to which the reference control technology (defined in § 63.111 of this subpart) is not applied and all other emission points being controlled as part of the average.

(c) The following emission points can be used to generate emissions averaging credits, if control was applied after November 15, 1990 and if sufficient information is available to determine the appropriate value of credits for the emission point:

(1) Group 2 emission points.

(2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a technology that the Administrator or permitting authority agrees has a higher nominal efficiency than the reference control technology. Information on the nominal efficiencies for such technologies must be submitted and approved as provided in paragraph (i) of this section.

(3) Emission points from which emissions are reduced by pollution prevention measures. Percent reductions for pollution prevention measures shall be determined as specified in paragraph (j) of this section.

(i) For a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had the reference control technology been applied to the emission point instead of the pollution prevention measure except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section.

(ii) If a pollution prevention measure is used in conjunction with other controls for a Group 1 emission point, the pollution prevention measure alone does not have to reduce emissions more than the reference control technology, but the combination of the pollution prevention measure and other controls must reduce emissions more than the reference control technology would have had it been applied instead.

(d) The following emission points cannot be used to generate emissions averaging credits:

(1) Emission points already controlled on or before November 15, 1990, unless the level of control is increased after November 15, 1990, in which case credit will be allowed only for the increase in control after November 15, 1990.

(2) Group 1 emission points that are controlled by a reference control technology, unless the reference control technology has been approved for use in a different manner and a higher nominal efficiency has been assigned according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section. For example, it is not allowable to claim that an internal floating roof meeting the specifications of § 63.119(b) of this subpart applied to a storage vessel is achieving greater than 95 percent control.

(3) Emission points on shut-down process units. Process units that are shut down cannot be used to generate credits or debits.

(4) Wastewater that is not process wastewater or wastewater streams treated in biological treatment units. These two types of wastewater cannot be used to generate credits or debits. For the purposes of this section, the terms wastewater and wastewater stream are used to mean process wastewater.

(5) Emission points controlled to comply with a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, unless the level of control has been increased after November 15, 1990 above what is required by the other State or Federal rule. Only the control above what is required by the other State or Federal rule will be credited. However, if an emission point has been used to generate emissions averaging credit in an approved emissions average, and the point is subsequently made subject to a State or Federal rule other than this subpart, the point can continue to generate emissions averaging credit for the purpose of complying with the previously approved average.

(e) For all points included in an emissions average, the owner or operator shall:

(1) Calculate and record monthly debits for all Group 1 emission points that are controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology for those emission points. Equations in paragraph (g) of this section shall be used to calculate debits.

(2) Calculate and record monthly credits for all Group 1 or Group 2 emission points that are overcontrolled to compensate for the debits. Equations in paragraph (h) of this section shall be used to calculate credits. Emission points and controls that meet the criteria of paragraph (c) of this section may be included in the credit calculation, whereas those described in paragraph (d) of this section shall not be included.

(3) Demonstrate that annual credits calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section are greater than or equal to debits calculated for the same annual compliance period according to paragraph (g) of this section.

(i) The owner or operator may choose to include more than the required number of credit-generating emission points in an average in order to increase the likelihood of being in compliance.

(ii) The initial demonstration in the Implementation Plan or operating permit application that credit-generating emission points will be capable of generating sufficient credits to offset the debits from the debit-generating emission points must be made under representative operating conditions. After the compliance date, actual operating data will be used for all debit and credit calculations.

(4) Demonstrate that debits calculated for a quarterly (3-month) period according to paragraph (g) of this section are not more than 1.30 times the credits for the same period calculated according to paragraph (h) of this section. Compliance for the quarter shall be determined based on the ratio of credits and debits from that quarter, with 30 percent more debits than credits allowed on a quarterly basis.

(5) Record and report quarterly and annual credits and debits in the Periodic Reports as specified in § 63.152(c) of this subpart. Every fourth Periodic Report shall include a certification of compliance with the emissions averaging provisions as required by § 63.152(c)(5)(iv)(B) of this subpart.

(f) Debits and credits shall be calculated in accordance with the methods and procedures specified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section, respectively, and shall not include emissions from the following:

(1) More than 20 individual Group 1 or Group 2 emission points. Where pollution prevention measures (as specified in paragraph (j)(1) of this section) are used to control emission points to be included in an emissions average, no more than 25 emission points may be included in the average. For example, if two emission points to be included in an emissions average are controlled by pollution prevention measures, the average may include up to 22 emission points.

(2) Periods of start-up, shutdown, and malfunction as described in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan required by § 63.6(e)(3). For each source as defined in § 63.101, on and after July 15, 2027, this paragraph no longer applies.

(3) Periods of monitoring excursions as defined in § 63.152(c)(2)(ii)(A) of this subpart. For these periods, the calculation of monthly credits and debits shall be adjusted as specified in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) through (f)(3)(iii) of this section.

(i) No credits would be assigned to the credit-generating emission point.

(ii) Maximum debits would be assigned to the debit-generating emission point.

(iii) The owner or operator may demonstrate to the Administrator that full or partial credits or debits should be assigned using the procedures in paragraph (l) of this section.

(g) Debits are generated by the difference between the actual emissions from a Group 1 emission point that is uncontrolled or is controlled to a level less stringent than the reference control technology, and the emissions allowed for the Group 1 emission point. Debits shall be calculated as follows:

The sampling site for measurement of uncontrolled emissions is after the final recovery device. However, as provided in § 63.113(a)(3), except as specified in § 63.113(a)(4), a Group 1 process vent may add sufficient recovery to raise the TRE index value above 1.0, thereby becoming a Group 2 process vent.

(j) The following procedures shall be used for calculating the efficiency (percent reduction) of pollution prevention measures:

(1) A pollution prevention measure is any practice which meets the criteria of paragraphs (j)(1)(i) and (j)(1)(ii) of this section.

(i) A pollution prevention measure is any practice that results in a lesser quantity of organic HAP emissions per unit of product released to the atmosphere prior to out-of-process recycling, treatment, or control of emissions, while the same product is produced.

(ii) Pollution prevention measures may include: substitution of feedstocks that reduce HAP emissions; alterations to the production process to reduce the volume of materials released to the environment; equipment modifications; housekeeping measures; and in-process recycling that returns waste materials directly to production as raw materials. Production cutbacks do not qualify as pollution prevention.

(2) The emission reduction efficiency of pollution prevention measures implemented after November 15, 1990, can be used in calculating the actual emissions from an emission point in the debit and credit equations in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section. When the term “organic HAP” is used in § 63.150(j)(2) in reference to wastewater emission points, the term “table 9 HAP” shall apply for the purposes of this paragraph.

(i) For pollution prevention measures, the percent reduction used in the equations in paragraphs (g)(2) through (g)(5) of this section and paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(5) of this section is the percent difference between the monthly organic HAP emissions for each emission point after the pollution prevention measure for the most recent month versus monthly emissions from the same emission point before the pollution prevention measure, adjusted by the volume of product produced during the two monthly periods.

(ii) The following equation shall be used to calculate the percent reduction of a pollution prevention measure for each emission point.

![](/graphics/er22ap94.290.gif)where:Percent reduction = Efficiency of pollution prevention measure (percent organic HAP reduction).EB = Monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, determined as specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(A), (j)(2)(ii)(B), and (j)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.Epp = Monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month, determined as specified in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) or (j)(2)(ii)(E) of this section.PB = Monthly production before the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, during the same period over which EB is calculated.Ppp = Monthly production after the pollution prevention measure, megagrams per month, as determined for the most recent month.

(A) The monthly emissions before the pollution prevention measure, EB, shall be determined in a manner consistent with the equations and procedures in paragraphs (g)(2), (g)(3), and (g)(4) of this section for process vents, storage vessels, and transfer operations.

(B) For wastewater, EB shall be calculated as follows:

![](/graphics/er26ap99.011.gif)Where:n = Number of wastewater streams.QBi = Average flow rate for wastewater stream i before the pollution prevention measure, defined and determined according to paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, liters per minute, before implementation of the pollution prevention measure.HBi = Number of hours per month that wastewater stream i was discharged before the pollution prevention measure, hours per month.s = Total number of table 9 HAP in wastewater stream i.Fem = Fraction emitted of table 9 HAP m in wastewater of this subpart, dimensionless.HAPBim = Average concentration of table 9 HAP m in wastewater stream i, defined and determined according to paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section, before the pollution prevention measure, parts per million by weight, as measured before the implementation of the pollution measure.

(C) If the pollution prevention measure was implemented prior to April 22, 1994, records may be used to determine EB.

(D) The monthly emissions after the pollution prevention measure, Epp, may be determined during a performance test or by a design evaluation and documented engineering calculations. Once an emissions-to-production ratio has been established, the ratio can be used to estimate monthly emissions from monthly production records.

(E) For wastewater, Epp shall be calculated using the following equation:

![](/graphics/er22ap94.292.gif)where n, Qppi, Hppi, s, Fem, and HAPppim are defined and determined as described in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of this section except that Qppi, Hppi, and HAPppim shall be determined after the pollution prevention measure has been implemented.

(iii) All equations, calculations, test procedures, test results, and other information used to determine the percent reduction achieved by a pollution prevention measure for each emission point shall be fully documented.

(iv) The same pollution prevention measure may reduce emissions from multiple emission points. In such cases, the percent reduction in emissions for each emission point must be calculated.

(v) For the purposes of the equations in paragraphs (h)(2) through (h)(5) of this section, used to calculate credits for emission points controlled more stringently than the reference control technology, the nominal efficiency of a pollution prevention measure is equivalent to the percent reduction of the pollution prevention measure. When a pollution prevention measure is used, the owner or operator of a source is not required to apply to the Administrator for a nominal efficiency and is not subject to paragraph (i) of this section.

(k) The owner or operator must demonstrate that the emissions from the emission points proposed to be included in the average will not result in greater hazard or, at the option of the operating permit authority, greater risk to human health or the environment than if the emission points were controlled according to the provisions in §§ 63.113 through 63.148.

(1) This demonstration of hazard or risk equivalency shall be made to the satisfaction of the operating permit authority.

(3) An emissions averaging plan that does not demonstrate hazard or risk equivalency to the satisfaction of the Administrator shall not be approved. The Administrator may require such adjustments to the emissions averaging plan as are necessary in order to ensure that the average will not result in greater hazard or risk to human health or the environment than would result if the emission points were controlled according to §§ 63.113 through 63.148 of this subpart.

(4) A hazard or risk equivalency demonstration must:

(i) Be a quantitative, bona fide chemical hazard or risk assessment;

(ii) Account for differences in chemical hazard or risk to human health or the environment; and

(iii) Meet any requirements set by the Administrator for such demonstrations.

(l) For periods of excursions, an owner or operator may request that the provisions of paragraphs (l)(1) through (l)(4) of this section be followed instead of the procedures in paragraphs (f)(3)(i) and (f)(3)(ii) of this section.

(1) The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of excursions in the Periodic Reports as required in § 63.152 of this subpart.

This demonstration shall be made to the Administrator's satisfaction, and the Administrator may establish procedures of demonstrating compliance that are acceptable.

(3) The owner or operator shall provide documentation of the excursion and the other type of monitoring data or engineering calculations to be used to demonstrate that the control device for the emission point was operating in such a fashion to warrant assigning full or partial credits and debits.
