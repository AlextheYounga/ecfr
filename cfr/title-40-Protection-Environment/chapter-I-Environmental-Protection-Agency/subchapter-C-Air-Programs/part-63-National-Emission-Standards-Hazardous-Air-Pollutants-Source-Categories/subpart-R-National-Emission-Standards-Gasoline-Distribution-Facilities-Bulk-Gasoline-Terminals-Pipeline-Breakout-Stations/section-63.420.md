No later than May 8, 2027, the affected source to which the provisions of this subpart apply is each bulk gasoline terminal located at a major source as defined in § 63.2.

(1) Bulk gasoline terminals for which the owner or operator has documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction that the result, ET, of the following equation is less than 1, and complies with requirements in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section:

ET = CF[0.59(TF)(1-CE) + 0.17 (TE) + 0.08(TES) + 0.038(TI) + 8.5 × 10-6(C) + KQ] + 0.04(OE)where: ET = emissions screening factor for bulk gasoline terminals; CF = 0.161 for bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations that do not handle any reformulated or oxygenated gasoline containing 7.6 percent by volume or greater methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), ORCF = 1.0 for bulk gasoline terminals and pipeline breakout stations that handle reformulated or oxygenated gasoline containing 7.6 percent by volume or greater MTBE;CE = control efficiency limitation on potential to emit for the vapor processing system used to control emissions from fixed-roof gasoline storage vessels [value should be added in decimal form (percent divided by 100)];TF = total number of fixed-roof gasoline storage vessels without an internal floating roof; TE = total number of external floating roof gasoline storage vessels with only primary seals; TES = total number of external floating roof gasoline storage vessels with primary and secondary seals; TI = total number of fixed-roof gasoline storage vessels with an internal floating roof; C = number of valves, pumps, connectors, loading arm valves, and open-ended lines in gasoline service; Q = gasoline throughput limitation on potential to emit or gasoline throughput limit in compliance with paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of this section (liters/day);K = 4.52 × 10−6 for bulk gasoline terminals with uncontrolled loading racks (no vapor collection and processing systems), *OR*K = (4.5 × 10−9)(EF + L) for bulk gasoline terminals with controlled loading racks (loading racks that have vapor collection and processing systems installed on the emission stream); EF = emission rate limitation on potential to emit for the gasoline cargo tank loading rack vapor processor outlet emissions (mg of total organic compounds per liter of gasoline loaded);OE = other HAP emissions screening factor for bulk gasoline terminals or pipeline breakout stations (tons per year). OE equals the total HAP from other emission sources not specified in parameters in the equations for ET or EP. If the value of 0.04(OE) is greater than 5 percent of either ET or EP, then paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section shall not be used to determine applicability;L = 13 mg/l for gasoline cargo tanks meeting the requirement to satisfy the test criteria for a vapor-tight gasoline tank truck in § 60.501 of this chapter, *OR*L = 304 mg/l for gasoline cargo tanks not meeting the requirement to satisfy the test criteria for a vapor-tight gasoline tank truck in § 60.501 of this chapter; or

(2) Bulk gasoline terminals for which the owner or operator has documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction that the facility is not a major source, or is not located within a contiguous area and under common control of a facility that is a major source, as defined in § 63.2.

(b) Prior to May 8, 2027, the affected source to which the provisions of this subpart apply is each pipeline breakout station, except those pipeline breakout stations meeting either of the criteria listed in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section. No later than May 8, 2027, the affected source to which the provisions of this subpart apply is each pipeline breakout station located at a major source as defined in § 63.2.

(1) Pipeline breakout stations for which the owner or operator has documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction that the result, EP, of the following equation is less than 1, and complies with requirements in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section:

EP = CF [6.7(TF)(1-CE) + 0.21(TE) + 0.093(TES) + 0.1(TI) + 5.31 × 10−6(C)) + 0.04(OE);where:EP = emissions screening factor for pipeline breakout stations,and the definitions for CF, TF, CE, TE, TES, TI, C, and OE are the same as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

(2) Pipeline breakout stations for which the owner or operator has documented and recorded to the Administrator's satisfaction that the facility is not a major source, or is not located within a contiguous area and under common control of a facility that is a major source, as defined in § 63.2.

(c) Prior to May 8, 2027, a facility for which the results, ET or EP, of the calculation in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section has been documented and is less than 1.0 but greater than or equal to 0.50, is exempt from the requirements of this subpart, except that the owner or operator shall:

(1) Operate the facility such that none of the facility parameters used to calculate results under paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, and approved by the Administrator, is exceeded in any rolling 30-day period; and

(2) Maintain records and provide reports in accordance with the provisions of § 63.428(l)(4).

(d) Prior to May 8, 2027, a facility for which the results, ET or EP, of the calculation in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section has been documented and is less than 0.50, is exempt from the requirements of this subpart, except that the owner or operator shall:

(1) Operate the facility such that none of the facility parameters used to calculate results under paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section is exceeded in any rolling 30-day period; and

(2) Maintain records and provide reports in accordance with the provisions of § 63.428(l)(5).

(e) The provisions of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section shall not be used to determine applicability to bulk gasoline terminals or pipeline breakout stations that are either:

(1) Located within a contiguous area and under common control with another bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station, or

(2) Located within a contiguous area and under common control with other sources not specified in paragraphs (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, that emit or have the potential to emit a hazardous air pollutant.

(f) Upon request by the Administrator, the owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station subject to the provisions of any paragraphs in this section including, but not limited to, the parameters and assumptions used in the applicable equation in paragraph (a)(1) or (b)(1) of this section, shall demonstrate compliance with those paragraphs.

(g) Each owner or operator of a bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station subject to the provisions of this subpart that is also subject to applicable provisions of part 60, subpart Kb, XX, or XXa, of this chapter shall comply only with the provisions in each subpart that contain the most stringent control requirements for that facility.

(h) Each owner or operator of an affected source bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station is subject to the provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subpart A—General Provisions, as indicated in Table 1.

(i) A bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station with a Standard Industrial Classification code 2911 located within a contiguous area and under common control with a refinery complying with §§ 63.646, 63.648, 63.649, 63.650, and 63.660 is not subject to the standards in this subpart, except as specified in § 63.650.

(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, the December 14, 1995, compliance date for existing facilities in §§ 63.424(e) and 63.428(a), (l)(4)(i), and (l)(5)(i) is stayed from December 8, 1995, to March 7, 1996.

(k) Each owner or operator of an affected source bulk gasoline terminal or pipeline breakout station must comply with the standards in this part at all times. At all times, the owner or operator must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. The general duty to minimize emissions does not require the owner or operator to make any further efforts to reduce emissions if levels required by the applicable standard have been achieved. Determination of whether a source is operating in compliance with operation and maintenance requirements will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.
