##### § 63.4961 How do I demonstrate initial compliance? #####

(a) *When add-on controls are used.* You may use the emission rate with add-on controls option for any coating operation, for any group of coating operations in the affected source, or for all of the coating operations in the affected source. You may include both controlled and uncontrolled coating operations in a group for which you use this option. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option for any coating operation in the affected source for which you do not use the emission rate with add-on controls option. To demonstrate initial compliance, the coating operation or group of coating operations for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option must meet the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890, and each controlled coating operation must meet the operating limits and work practice standards required in §§ 63.4892 and 63.4893, respectively. You must meet all the requirements of this section to demonstrate initial compliance with the emission limitations. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coatings, thinners, or cleaning materials used on coating operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option.

(b) *Compliance with operating limits.* Except as provided in § 63.4960(a)(4), you must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required by § 63.4892, using the procedures specified in §§ 63.4966 and 63.4967.

(c) *Compliance with work practice requirements.* You must develop, implement, and document your implementation of the work practice plan required by § 63.4893 during the initial compliance period, as specified in § 63.4930.

(d) *Compliance with emission limits.* You must follow the procedures in paragraphs (e) through (m) of this section to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission limit in § 63.4890.

(e) *Determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, volume used, and volume fraction of coating solids.* Follow the procedures specified in § 63.4951(a) through (d) to determine the mass fraction of organic HAP, density, and volume of each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used during each compliance period and the volume fraction of coating solids for each coating used during each compliance period.

(f) *Calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls.* Using Equation 1 of § 63.4951, calculate the total mass of organic HAP emissions before add-on controls from all coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used during the compliance period.

(g) *Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation.* Determine the mass of organic HAP emissions reduced for each controlled coating operation during each compliance period. The emission reduction determination quantifies the total organic HAP emissions that pass through the emission capture system and are destroyed or removed by the add-on control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (h) of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. For each controlled coating operation using a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance, use the procedures in paragraph (j) of this section to calculate the organic HAP emission reduction.

(h) *Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for controlled coating operations not using liquid-liquid material balance.* For each controlled coating operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances, calculate the organic HAP emission reduction, using Equation 1 of this section. The calculation applies the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials that are used in the coating operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during the compliance period. For any period of time a deviation specified in § 63.4962(c) or (d) occurs in the controlled coating operation, you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device. Equation 1 of this section treats the materials used during such a deviation as if they were used on an uncontrolled coating operation for the time period of the deviation:
