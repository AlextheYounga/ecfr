##### ยง 63.5714 How do I demonstrate compliance if I use filled resins? #####

(a) If you are using a filled production resin or filled tooling resin, you must demonstrate compliance for the filled material on an as-applied basis using equation 1 of this section.

![](/graphics/er22au01.015.gif)Where:PVF = The as-applied MACT model point value for a filled production resin or tooling resin, kilograms organic HAP per megagram of filled material.PVu = The MACT model point value for the neat (unfilled) resin, before filler is added, as calculated using the formulas in Table 3 to this subpart.% Filler = The weight-percent of filler in the as-applied filled resin system.

(b) If the filled resin is used as a production resin and the value of PVF calculated by equation 1 of this section does not exceed 46 kilograms of organic HAP per megagram of filled resin applied, then the filled resin is in compliance.

(c) If the filled resin is used as a tooling resin and the value of PVF calculated by equation 1 of this section does not exceed 54 kilograms of organic HAP per megagram of filled resin applied, then the filled resin is in compliance.

(d) If you are including a filled resin in the emissions averaging procedure described in ยง 63.5710, then use the value of PVF calculated using equation 1 of this section for the value of PV i in equation 2 of ยง 63.5710.
