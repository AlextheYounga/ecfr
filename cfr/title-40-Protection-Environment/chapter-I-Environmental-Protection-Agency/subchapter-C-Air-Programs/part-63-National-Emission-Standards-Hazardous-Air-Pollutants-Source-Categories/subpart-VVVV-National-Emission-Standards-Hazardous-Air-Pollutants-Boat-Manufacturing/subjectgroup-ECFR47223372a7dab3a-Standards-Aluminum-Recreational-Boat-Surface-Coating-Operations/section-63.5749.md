##### ยง 63.5749 How do I calculate the organic HAP content of aluminum wipedown solvents? #####

(a) Use equation 1 of this section to calculate the weighted-average organic HAP content of aluminum wipedown solvents used in the past 12 months.

![](/graphics/er22au01.016.gif)Where:HAPWD = weighted-average organic HAP content of aluminum wipedown solvents, kilograms of HAP per liter of total coating solids from aluminum primers, top coats, and clear coats. n = number of different wipedown solvents used in the past 12 months.Volj = volume of aluminum wipedown solvent j used in the past 12 months, liters.Dj = density of aluminum wipedown solvent j, kilograms per liter.Wj = mass fraction of organic HAP in aluminum wipedown solvent j. m = number of different aluminum surface coatings (primers, top coats, and clear coats) used in the past 12 months.Voli = volume of aluminum primer, top coat, or clear coat i used in the past 12 months, liters.Solidsi = solids content aluminum primer, top coat, or clear coat i, liter solids per liter of coating.

(b) Compliance is based on a 12-month rolling average. If the weighted-average organic HAP content does not exceed 0.33 kilograms of organic HAP per liter of total coating solids, then you are in compliance with the emission limit specified in ยง 63.5743(a)(1).
