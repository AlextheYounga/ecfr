##### ยง 63.5885 How do I calculate percent reduction to demonstrate compliance for continuous lamination/casting operations? #####

You may calculate percent reduction using any of the methods in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.

(a) *Compliant line option.* If all of your wet-out areas have PTE that meet the requirements of EPA Method 204 of appendix M of 40 CFR part 51, and all of your wet-out area organic HAP emissions and oven organic HAP emissions are vented to an add-on control device, use Equation 1 of this section to demonstrate compliance. In all other situations, use Equation 2 of this section to demonstrate compliance.

(b) *Averaging option.* Use Equation 3 of this section to calculate percent reduction.

(c) *Add-on control device option.* Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate percent reduction.

(d) *Combination option.* Use Equations 1 through 3 of this section, as applicable, to calculate percent reduction.
