##### § 63.8687 What performance tests, design evaluations, and other procedures must I use? #####

(a) You must conduct each performance test in Table 3 to this subpart that applies to you.

(b) Each performance test must be conducted under normal operating conditions and under the conditions specified in Table 3 to this subpart. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, or nonoperation do not constitute representative conditions for purposes of conducting a performance test. You may not conduct performance tests during periods of malfunction. You must record the process information that is necessary to document operating conditions during the test and explain why the conditions represent normal operation. Upon request, you must make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) Except for opacity and visible emission observations, you must conduct three separate test runs for each performance test required in this section, as specified in § 63.7(e)(3). Each test run must last at least 1 hour.

(e) You must use the following equations to determine compliance with the emission limitations.

(1) To determine compliance with the particulate matter mass emission rate, you must use Equations 1 and 2 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er17my05.000.gif)Where:E = Particulate matter emission rate, kilograms of particulate matter per megagram of roofing product manufactured.MPM = Particulate matter mass emission rate, kilograms per hour, determined using Equation 2.P = The asphalt roofing product manufacturing rate during the emissions sampling period, including any material trimmed from the final product, megagram per hour.![](/graphics/er17my05.001.gif)Where:MPM = Particulate matter mass emission rate, kilograms per hour.C = Concentration of particulate matter on a dry basis, grams per dry standard cubic meter (g/dscm), as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart.Q = Vent gas stream flow rate (dry standard cubic meters per minute) at a temperature of 20 °C as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart.K = Unit conversion constant (0.06 minute-kilogram/hour-gram).

(2) To determine compliance with the total hydrocarbon percent reduction standard, you must use Equations 3 and 4 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er17my05.002.gif)Where:RE = Emission reduction efficiency, percent.MTHCi = Mass flow rate of total hydrocarbons entering the control device, kilograms per hour, determined using Equation 4.MTHCo = Mass flow rate of total hydrocarbons exiting the control device, kilograms per hour, determined using Equation 4.![](/graphics/er17my05.003.gif)Where:MTHC = Total hydrocarbon mass flow rate, kilograms per hour.C = Concentration of total hydrocarbons on a dry basis, parts per million by volume (ppmv), as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart.Q = Vent gas stream flow rate (dscm/minute) at a temperature of 20 °C as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart.K = Unit conversion constant (1.10E-04 (ppmv) −1 (kilogram/dscm)(minute/hour)).

(3) To determine compliance with the combustion efficiency standard, you must use Equation 5 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er29ap03.004.gif)Where:CE = Combustion efficiency, percent. CO = Carbon monoxide concentration at the combustion device outlet, parts per million by volume (dry), as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart. CO2 = Carbon dioxide concentration at the combustion device outlet, parts per million by volume (dry), as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart. THC = Total hydrocarbon concentration at the combustion device outlet, parts per million by volume (dry), as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart.

(4) To determine compliance with the total hydrocarbon destruction efficiency standard for a combustion device that does not use auxiliary fuel, you must use Equation 6 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er29ap03.005.gif)Where:THC DE = THC destruction efficiency, percent. CO = Carbon monoxide concentration at the combustion device outlet, parts per million by volume (dry), as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart. CO2 = Carbon dioxide concentration at the combustion device outlet, parts per million by volume (dry), as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart. THC = Total hydrocarbon concentration at the combustion device outlet, parts per million by volume (dry), as measured by the test method specified in Table 3 to this subpart.[68 FR 24577, May 7, 2003, as amended at 70 FR 28364, May 17, 2005; 85 FR 14549, Mar. 12, 2020]
