You may include both controlled and uncontrolled web coating/printing operations in a group for which you use this option. You must use either the compliant material option, the emission rate without add-on controls option, the organic HAP overall control efficiency option, or the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration option for any web coating/printing operation in the affected source for which you do not use the emission rate with add-on controls option.

You must meet all the requirements of paragraphs (a), (c), (d), and (e) of this section. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any coating, printing, thinning, or cleaning materials applied on web coating/printing operations for which you use the compliant material option, the emission rate without add-on controls option, the organic HAP overall control efficiency option, or the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in coating, printing, thinning, or cleaning materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the web coating/printing operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on control option.

(b) You may use the emission rate with add-on controls option for any individual dyeing/finishing operation, for any group of dyeing/finishing operations in the affected source, or for all of the dyeing/finishing operations in the affected source. You may include both controlled and uncontrolled dyeing/finishing operations in a group for which you use this option. You must use either the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option for any dyeing/finishing operation in the affected source for which you do not use the emission rate with add-on controls option. You may not use the emission rate with add-on controls option for any dyeing/finishing operation in a dyeing/finishing affected source for which you use the equivalent emission rate option. To demonstrate initial compliance, any dyeing/finishing operation for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option must meet the applicable emission limitations in Table 1 to this subpart, and in §§ 63.4292 and 63.4293. You must meet all the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (f) this section. When calculating the organic HAP emission rate according to this section, do not include any dyeing or finishing materials applied on dyeing/finishing operations for which you use the compliant material option or the emission rate without add-on controls option. You do not need to redetermine the mass of organic HAP in dyeing or finishing materials that have been reclaimed onsite and reused in the dyeing/finishing operation(s) for which you use the emission rate with add-on controls option.

(c) *Compliance with operating limits.* Except as provided in § 63.4340(a)(4), and except for solvent recovery systems for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to § 63.4341(e)(5) or (f)(5), you must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required by § 63.4292, using the procedures specified in §§ 63.4363 and 63.4364.

(3) *Calculate the organic HAP emissions reductions for each controlled web coating/printing operation.* Determine the mass of organic HAP emissions reduced for each controlled web coating/printing operation during the compliance period. The emissions reductions determination quantifies the total organic HAP emissions that pass through the emission capture system and are destroyed or removed by the add-on control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (e)(4) of this section to calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions reductions for each controlled web coating/printing operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances. For each controlled web coating/printing operation using a solvent recovery system for which you conduct a liquid-liquid material balance, use the procedures in paragraph (e)(5) of this section to calculate the organic HAP emissions reductions.

(4) *Calculate the organic HAP emission reduction for each controlled web coating/printing operation not using liquid-liquid material balance.* For each controlled web coating/printing operation using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances, calculate the organic HAP emissions reductions using Equation 1 of this section. The equation applies the emission capture system efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic HAP contained in the coating, printing, thinning, and cleaning materials applied in the web coating/printing operation served by the emission capture system and add-on control device during the compliance period. For any period of time a deviation specified in § 63.4342(c) or (d) occurs in the controlled web coating/printing operation, then you must assume zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control device. Equation 1 of this section treats the coating, printing, thinning, and cleaning materials applied during such a deviation as if they were used on an uncontrolled web coating/printing operation for the time period of the deviation.
