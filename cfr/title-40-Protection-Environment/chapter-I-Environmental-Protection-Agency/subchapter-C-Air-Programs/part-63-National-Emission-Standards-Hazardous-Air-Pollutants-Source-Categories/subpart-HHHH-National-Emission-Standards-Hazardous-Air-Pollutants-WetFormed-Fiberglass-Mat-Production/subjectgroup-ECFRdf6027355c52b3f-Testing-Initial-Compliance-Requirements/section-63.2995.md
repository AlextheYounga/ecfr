(a) *Percent reduction for formaldehyde.* To determine compliance with the percent reduction formaldehyde emission standard, use equation 1 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er11ap02.021.gif)Where:Ef = Formaldehyde control efficiency, percent. Mi = Mass flow rate of formaldehyde entering the control device, kilograms (pounds) per hour. Mo = Mass flow rate of formaldehyde exiting the control device, kilograms (pounds) per hour.

(b) *Formaldehyde mass emissions rate.* To determine compliance with the kilogram per megagram (pound per ton) formaldehyde emission standard, use equation 2 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er11ap02.022.gif)Where: E = Formaldehyde mass emissions rate, kilograms (pounds) of formaldehyde per megagram (ton) of fiberglass mat produced. M = Formaldehyde mass emissions rate, kilograms (pounds) per hour. P = The wet-formed fiberglass mat production rate during the emissions sampling period, including any material trimmed from the final product, megagrams (tons) per hour.

(c) *Urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin solids application rate.* To determine the UF resin solids application rate, use equation 3 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er11ap02.023.gif)Where: UF solids/hour = UF resin solids application rate (pounds per hour). LOI = loss on ignition (weight faction), or pound of organic binder per pound of mat. UFL = UF-to-latex ratio in the binder (mass fraction of UF resin solids in total combined resin solids for UF and latex), or pound of UF solids per pound of total resin solids (UF and latex). MW = weight of the final mat per square (pounds per roofing square). SQ = roofing squares produced per hour.
