##### ยง 63.1190 How do I determine compliance? #####

(a) Using the results of the performance tests, you must use the following equation to determine compliance with the PM emission limit:

![](/graphics/er01jn99.015.gif)where:E = Emission rate of PM, kg/Mg (lb/ton) of melt.C = Concentration of PM, g/dscm (gr/dscf).Q = Volumetric flow rate of exhaust gases, dscm/hr (dscf/hr).K 51 = Conversion factor, 1 kg/1,000 g (1 lb/7,000 gr).P = Average melt rate, Mg/hr (ton/hr).

(b) Using the results from the performance tests, you must use the following equation to determine compliance with the carbon monoxide, carbonyl sulfide, hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen chloride, formaldehyde, phenol, and methanol numerical emissions limits as specified in Table 2 to this subpart:
