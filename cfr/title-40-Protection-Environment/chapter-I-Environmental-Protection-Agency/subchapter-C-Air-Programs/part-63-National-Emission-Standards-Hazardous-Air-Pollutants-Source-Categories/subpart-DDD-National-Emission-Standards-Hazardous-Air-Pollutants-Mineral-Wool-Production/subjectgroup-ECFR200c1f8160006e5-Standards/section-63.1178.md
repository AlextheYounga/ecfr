##### ยง 63.1178 For cupolas, what standards must I meet? #####

(a) You must control emissions from each cupola as specified in Table 2 to this subpart.

(b) You must meet the following operating limits for each cupola:

(1) Begin within one hour after the alarm on a bag leak detection system sounds, and complete in a timely manner, corrective actions as specified in your operations, maintenance, and monitoring plan required by ยง 63.1187 of this subpart.

(2) When the alarm on a bag leak detection system sounds for more than five percent of the total operating time in a six-month reporting period, develop and implement a written quality improvement plan (QIP) consistent with the compliance assurance monitoring requirements of ยง 64.8(b)-(d) of 40 CFR part 64.

(3) Additionally, on or after the applicable compliance date for each new or reconstructed cupola, you must either:

(i) Maintain the operating temperature of the incinerator so that the average operating temperature for each three-hour block period never falls below the average temperature established during the performance test, or

(ii) Maintain the percent excess oxygen in the cupola at or above the level established during the performance test. You must determine the percent excess oxygen using the following equation:
