(ii) Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for International Paper Prattville Mill, Prattville, Alabama, for subpart MM of this part—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills. This action is contingent upon ADEM including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the Federal standard. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the Federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.

(2) *Alaska.* (i) The following table lists the specific part 63 standards that have been delegated unchanged to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. The (X) symbol is used to indicate each subpart that has been delegated.

(A) The material incorporated in Chapter 1 of the *California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Air Toxics Program* (California Code of Regulations Title 17, sections 93109, 93109.1, and 93109.2) pertains to the perchloroethylene dry cleaning source category in the State of California, and has been approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of subpart M—National Perchloroethylene Air Emission Standards for Dry Cleaning Facilities, as it applies to area sources only, as defined in § 63.320(h).

(*1*) Authorities not delegated.

(*i*) California is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce California Code of Regulations Title 17, section 93109, in lieu of those provisions of subpart M which apply to major sources, as defined in § 63.320(g). Dry cleaning facilities which are major sources remain subject to subpart M.

(*ii*) California is not delegated the Administrator's authority of § 63.325 to determine equivalency of emissions control technologies. Any source seeking permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation, under sections 93109(d)(27) or (38), or (i)(3)(A)(2), Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations, must also receive approval from the Administrator before using such alternative means of emission limitation for the purpose of complying with section 112 of the Clean Air Act.

(*iii*) This delegation does not extend to the provisions regarding California's enforcement authorities or its collection of fees as described in Sections 93109.1(c) or 93109.2(c) and (d), Title 17 of the California Code of Regulations. Approval of the California Code of Regulations, Title 17, sections 93109, 93109.1, and 93109.2 does not in any way limit the enforcement authorities, including the penalty authorities, of the Clean Air Act.

(B) [Reserved]

(*1*) Authorities not delegated.

(*i*) South Coast Air Quality Management District is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce Rule 1421 in lieu of those provisions of Subpart M which apply to major sources, as defined in § 63.320(g). Dry cleaning facilities which are major sources remain subject to Subpart M.

(*ii*) South Coast Air Quality Management District is not delegated the Administrator's authority of § 63.325 to determine equivalency of emissions control technologies. Any source seeking permission to use an alternative means of emission limitation, under sections (c)(17), (d)(3)(A)(v), (d)(4)(B)(ii)(III), and (j) of Rule 1421, must also receive approval from the Administrator before using such alternative means of emission limitation for the purpose of complying with section 112.

(D) [Reserved]

(E) The material incorporated in Chapter 5 of the California Regulatory Requirements Applicable to the Air Toxics Program (California Code of Regulations, Title 17, section 93102) pertains to the chromium electroplating and anodizing source category in the State of California, and has been approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of subpart N—National Emission Standards for Chromium Emissions from Hard and Decorative Chromium Electroplating and Chromium Anodizing Tanks.

(*1*) *Title V requirements.* Subpart N affected sources remain subject to both the Title V permitting requirements of § 63.340(e)(2) and, for major sources, the semi-annual submission of the ongoing compliance status reports as required by § 63.347(g).

(*2*) *Limits on maximum cumulative potential rectifier usage.* Section 93102(h)(7)(B) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure allows facilities with a maximum cumulative potential rectifier capacity of greater than 60 million ampere-hours per year to be considered small or medium by accepting a limit on the maximum cumulative potential rectifier usage. All such usage limits in non-Title V operating permits are federally-enforceable for the purpose of this rule substitution.

(*3*) *Permitting Agencies' breakdown/malfunction rules.* Section 93102(i)(4) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure provides that the owner or operator shall report breakdowns as required by the permitting agency's breakdown rule. Under this rule substitution, the permitting agencies' breakdown rules do not override or supplant the requirements of section 93102(g)(4), (h)(5), (h)(6), (i)(3)(B), or Appendix 3; neither expand the scope nor extend the time-frame of a breakdown beyond the definition of section 93102(b)(7); and do not grant the permitting agencies the authority to determine whether a breakdown has occurred, to grant emergency variances, or to decide to take no enforcement action. Owners or operators must submit written breakdown reports even if the permitting agency has not formally requested such reports.

(*4*) *Performance test requirements.* Section 93102(d)(3)(A) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure allows the use of California Air Resources Board Method 425, dated July 28, 1997, and South Coast Air Quality Management District Method 205.1, dated August 1991, for determining chromium emissions. Any alternatives, modifications, or variations to these test methods must be approved under the procedures in section 93102(k) of the California Airborne Toxic Control Measure.

(ii) Georgia Environmental Protection Division (GEPD) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for International Paper Augusta Mill, Augusta, Georgia, for subpart S of this part—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry. This action is contingent upon GEPD including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the Federal standard. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the Federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.

(20) Maine.

(i) [Reserved]

(ii) Maine Department of Environmental Protection (ME DEP) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for Lincoln Pulp and Paper, located in Lincoln, Maine, for subpart S—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry. This action is contingent upon ME DEP including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the federal standard and have been approved by EPA. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.

(iii) Affected area sources within Maine must comply with the Maine Regulations Applicable to Hazardous Air Pollutants (incorporated by reference as specified in § 63.14) as described in paragraph (a)(20)(iii)(A) of this section:

(A) The material incorporated into the Maine Department of Environmental Protection regulations at Chapter 125, Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaner Regulation, effective as of June 2, 1991, last amended on June 24, 2009, pertaining to dry cleaning facilities in the State of Maine jurisdiction, and approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of the Federal NESHAP for Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Facilities (subpart M of this part), effective as of July 11, 2008, for area sources only, as defined in § 63.320(h).

(*1*) Authorities not delegated.

(*i*) Maine is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce Maine regulations at Chapter 125, in lieu of those provisions of subpart M of this part which apply to major sources, as defined in § 63.320(g).

(*ii*) Maine is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce Maine regulations at Chapter 125, in lieu of those provisions of subpart M of this part which apply to dry cleaning systems installed in a building with a residence between July 13, 2006 and June 24, 2009, as defined in §§ 63.320(b)(2)(i) and 63.322(o)(4).

(*2*) [Reserved]

(B) [Reserved]

(21) *Maryland.* (i) Maryland is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing and future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the delegation agreement between EPA Region III and the Maryland Department of the Environment, dated November 3, 1999, and any mutually acceptable amendments to that agreement.

(ii) Maryland is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing 40 CFR part 63 standards and all future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards, if delegation is sought by the Maryland Department of the Environment and approved by EPA Region III, at affected sources which are not located at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the final rule, dated January 30, 2002, effective April 1, 2002, and any mutually acceptable amendments to the terms described in the direct final rule.

(iii) EPA has granted the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) “up-front” approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which the MDE may establish and enforce alternative State requirements for MeadWestvaco Company's Luke Mill in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Chemical Recovery Combustion Sources at Kraft, Soda, Sulfite, and Stand-Alone Semichemical Pulp Mills found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart MM. The MDE may only establish alternative requirements for the Luke Mill which are equivalent to and at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. The MDE must, in order to establish alternative requirements for the Luke Mill under its EPA approved EBP program: submit to EPA for review pre-draft Clean Air Act (CAA) Title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements which are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements, obtain EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft CAA Title V permit requirements, and issue a CAA Title V permit for the Luke Mill which contains the approved alternative requirements. Until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the MDE has issued a final CAA Title V permit incorporating them, MeadWestvaco Company's Luke Mill will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart MM.

(22) Massachusetts.

(ii) South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SC DHEC) may implement and enforce alternative requirements in the form of title V permit terms and conditions for International Paper Georgetown Mill, Georgetown, South Carolina, for subpart S of this part—National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry. This action is contingent upon SC DHEC including, in title V permits, terms and conditions that are no less stringent than the Federal standard. In addition, the requirement applicable to the source remains the Federal section 112 requirement until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the final title V permit is issued.

(42) [Reserved]

(43) *Tennessee.* (i) The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has “up-front” approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which TDEC may establish and enforce alternative requirements for the Ellison Surface Technologies, Inc. facility located in Morgan County, Tennessee (Ellison) in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for Plating and Polishing Operations at 40 CFR part 63, subpart WWWWWW, “National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Area Source Standards for Plating and Polishing Operations.” TDEC may only establish alternative requirements for Ellison that are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. TDEC must, in order to establish alternative requirements for Ellison under its EPA-approved EBP program: submit to the EPA for review pre-draft title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements that meet the criteria of 40 CFR 63.94(d), including the criterion that the alternative requirements are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements; obtain the EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft title V permit requirements; and issue a title V permit for Ellison that contains the approved alternative requirements. Until the EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and TDEC has issued a final title V permit incorporating them, Ellison will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart WWWWWW.

(44) *Texas.* (i) The following table lists the specific part 63 standards that have been delegated unchanged to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for all sources. The “X” symbol is used to indicate each subpart that has been delegated. The delegations are subject to all of the conditions and limitations set forth in Federal law and regulations.

(A) The material incorporated into the Vermont Air Pollution Regulations at Chapter 5, Air Pollution Control, section 5-253.11, Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning (effective as of December 15, 2016) pertaining to area source dry cleaning facilities in the State of Vermont jurisdiction, and approved under the procedures in § 63.93 to be implemented and enforced in place of the requirements for area source dry cleaning facilities in the Federal NESHAP for Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning Facilities (subpart M of this part), effective as of July 11, 2008. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(46) the term “area source dry cleaning facilities” means any source that qualifies as an area source under § 63.320(h).

(*1*) *Authorities not delegated.* (*i*) Vermont is not delegated the Administrator's authority to implement and enforce Vermont Air Pollution Control Regulations, Chapter 5, Air Pollution Control, section 5-253.11, in lieu of those provisions of subpart M of this part which apply to major sources, as defined in § 63.320(g).

(*ii*) [Reserved]

(*2*) [Reserved]

(B) [Reserved]

(ii) [Reserved]

(47) *Virginia.* (i) Virginia is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing and future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the delegation agreement between EPA Region III and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, dated April 20, 1998, and any mutually acceptable amendments to that agreement.

(ii) Virginia is delegated the authority to implement and enforce all existing 40 CFR part 63 standards and all future unchanged 40 CFR part 63 standards, if delegation is sought by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and approved by EPA Region III, at affected sources which are not located at major sources, as defined in 40 CFR part 70, in accordance with the final rule, dated January 8, 2002, effective March 11, 2002, and any mutually acceptable amendments to the terms described in the direct final rule.

(iii) EPA has granted the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) “up-front” approval to implement an Equivalency by Permit (EBP) program under which the Virginia DEQ may establish and enforce alternative State requirements for International Paper Company's Franklin Mill in lieu of those of the National Emissions Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) for the Pulp and Paper Industry found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart S. The Virginia DEQ may only establish alternative requirements for the Franklin Mill which are equivalent to and at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements. The VA DEQ must, in order to establish alternative requirements for the Franklin Mill under its EPA approved EBP program: (1) Submit to EPA for review pre-draft Clean Air Act (CAA) Title V permit terms specifying alternative requirements which are at least as stringent as the otherwise applicable Federal requirements, (2) obtain EPA's written approval of the alternative pre-draft CAA Title V permit requirements, and (3) issue a CAA Title V permit for the Franklin Mill which contains the approved alternative requirements. Until EPA has approved the alternative permit terms and conditions and the Virginia DEQ has issued a final CAA Title V permit incorporating them, International Paper Company's Franklin Mill will remain subject to the Federal NESHAP requirements found at 40 CFR part 63, subpart S.

(48) *Washington.* (i) The following table lists the delegation status of specific part 63 Subparts that have been delegated to state and local air pollution control agencies in Washington. An “X” indicates the subpart has been delegated, subject to all the conditions and limitations set forth in Federal law, regulations, policy, guidance, and determinations. Some authorities cannot be delegated and are retained by EPA. These include certain General Provisions authorities and specific parts of some standards. The dates noted at the end of this table indicate the effective dates of Federal rules that have been delegated. Any amendments made to these rules after this effective date are not delegated.
