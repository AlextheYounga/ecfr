(5) Calculate the average mercury emission rate for each by-product hydrogen stream and for each end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, using Equation 4 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er19de03.003.gif)Where: EHg,avg = Average mercury emission rate for the by-product hydrogen stream or the end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, g Hg/Mg Cl2; EHg,run = Mercury emission rate for each test run for the by-product hydrogen stream or the end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, g Hg/Mg Cl2, calculated using Equation 3 of this section; and n = Number of test runs conducted for the by-product hydrogen stream or the end box ventilation system vent, if applicable.

(6) Calculate the total mercury emission rate from all by-product hydrogen streams and all end box ventilation system vents, if applicable, at the mercury cell chlor-alkali production facility using Equation 5 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er19de03.004.gif)Where: EHg,H2EB = Total mercury emission rate from all by-product hydrogen streams and all end box ventilation system vents, if applicable, at the affected source, g Hg/Mg Cl2; EHg,avg = Average mercury emission rate for each by-product hydrogen stream and each end box ventilation system vent, if applicable, g Hg/Mg Cl2, determined using Equation 4 of this section; and n = Total number of by-product hydrogen streams and end box ventilation system vents at the affected source.

(b) *Mercury thermal recovery vents.* You must determine the milligrams of mercury per dscm exhaust discharged from mercury thermal recovery unit vents, using the procedures in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.

(1) Calculate the concentration of mercury in milligrams of mercury per dscm of exhaust for each test run for each mercury thermal recovery unit vent using Equation 6 of this section as follows:

![](/graphics/er19de03.005.gif)Where: CHg,run = Mercury concentration for the test run, milligrams of mercury per dry standard cubic meter of exhaust;mHg = Mass of mercury in test run sample, from Method 101, 101A, or 102, micrograms;10-3 = Conversion factor, milligrams per microgram; andVm(std) = Dry gas sample volume at standard conditions, from Method 101, 101A, or 102, dry standard cubic meters.

(2) Calculate the average concentration of mercury in each mercury thermal recovery unit vent exhaust using Equation 7 of this section as follows:
