##### § 63.1104 Process vents from continuous unit operations: applicability assessment procedures and methods. #####

(a) *General.* The provisions of this section provide calculation and measurement methods for criteria that are required by § 63.1103 to be used to determine applicability of the control requirements for process vents from continuous unit operations. The owner or operator of a process vent is not required to determine the criteria specified for a process vent that is being controlled (including control by flare) in accordance with the applicable weight-percent, TOC concentration, or organic HAP concentration requirement in § 63.1103.

(b) *Sampling sites.* For purposes of determining process vent applicability criteria, the sampling site shall be located as specified in (b)(1) through (4) of this section, as applicable.

(1) *Sampling site location if TRE determination is required.* If the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of § 63.1103 includes a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic HAP or TOC concentration, heating value, and TRE index value, shall be after the final recovery device (if any recovery devices are present) but prior to the inlet of any control device that is present, and prior to release to the atmosphere.

(2) *Sampling site location if TRE determination is not required.* If the applicability criteria specified in the applicable table of § 63.1103 does not include a TRE index value, the sampling site for determining volumetric flow rate, regulated organic HAP concentration, total organic HAP or TOC concentration, and any other specified parameter shall be at the exit from the unit operation before any control device.

(3) *Sampling site selection method.* Method 1 or 1A of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, as appropriate, shall be used for selection of the sampling site. No traverse site selection method is needed for process vents smaller than 0.10 meter (0.33 foot) in nominal inside diameter.

(4) *Sampling site when a halogen reduction device is used prior to a combustion device.* An owner or operator using a scrubber to reduce the process vent halogen atom mass emission rate to less than 0.45 kilograms per hour (0.99 pound per hour) prior to a combustion control device in compliance with § 63.1103 (as appropriate) shall determine the halogen atom mass emission rate prior to the combustion device according to the procedures in paragraph (i) of this section.

(c) *Applicability assessment requirements.* The TOC or organic HAP concentrations, process vent volumetric flow rates, process vent heating values, process vent TOC or organic HAP emission rates, halogenated process vent determinations, process vent TRE index values, and engineering assessments for process vent control applicability assessment requirements are to be determined during maximum representative operating conditions for the process, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, or unless the Administrator specifies or approves alternate operating conditions. For acrylic and modacrylic fiber production affected sources, carbon black production affected sources, cyanide chemicals manufacturing affected sources, polycarbonate production affected sources, and ethylene production affected sources, operations during periods of malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test. For all other affected sources, operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of an applicability test.

(d) *Exceptions.* For a process vent stream that consists of at least one process vent from a batch unit operation manifolded with at least one process vent from a continuous unit operation, the TRE shall be calculated during periods when one or more batch emission episodes are occurring that result in the highest organic HAP emission rate (in the combined vent stream that is being routed to the recovery device) that is achievable during the 6-month period that begins 3 months before and ends 3 months after the TRE calculation, without causing any of the situations described in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) to occur.

(1) Causing damage to equipment;

(2) Necessitating that the owner or operator make product that does not meet an existing specification for sale to a customer; or

(3) Necessitating that the owner or operator make product in excess of demand.

(e) *TOC or Organic HAP concentration.* The TOC or organic HAP concentrations shall be determined based on paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), or (k) of this section, or any other method or data that have been validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 63. For concentrations needed for comparison with the appropriate control applicability concentrations specified in § 63.1103, TOC or organic HAP concentration shall be determined based on paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), or (k) of this section or any other method or data that has been validated according to the protocol in method 301 of appendix A of this part. The owner or operator shall record the TOC or organic HAP concentration as specified in paragraph (l)(3) of this section.

(i) The minimum sampling time for each run shall be 1 hour in which either an integrated sample or four grab samples shall be taken. If grab sampling is used, then the samples shall be taken at approximately equal intervals in time, such as 15-minute intervals during the run.

A process vent is considered halogenated if the mass emission rate of halogen atoms contained in the organic compounds is equal to or greater than 0.45 kilograms per hour.

As specified in paragraph (m) of this section, the owner or operator shall include this information in the Notification of Compliance Status report required by § 63.1110(a)(4).

(4) *Process change records.* The owner or operator shall keep up-to-date, readily accessible records of any process changes that change the control applicability for a process vent. Records are to include any recalculation or measurement of the flow rate, regulated organic HAP or TOC concentration, and TRE index value.
