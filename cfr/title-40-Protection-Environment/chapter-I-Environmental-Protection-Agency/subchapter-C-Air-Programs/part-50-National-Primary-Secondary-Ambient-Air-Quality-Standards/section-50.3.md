Measurements of PM2.5 for purposes of comparison to the standards contained in §§ 50.7, 50.13, 50.18, and 50.20, and of lead for purposes of comparison to the standards contained in § 50.16 shall be reported based on actual ambient air volume measured at the actual ambient temperature and pressure at the monitoring site during the measurement period.
