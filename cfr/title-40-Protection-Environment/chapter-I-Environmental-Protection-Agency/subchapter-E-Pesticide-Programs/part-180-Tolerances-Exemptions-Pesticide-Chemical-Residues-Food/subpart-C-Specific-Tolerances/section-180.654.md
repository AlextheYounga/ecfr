##### ยง 180.654 Isopyrazam; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide isopyrazam, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only isopyrazam (3-(difluoromethyl)-1-methyl-*N*-[1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-(1-methylethyl)-1,4-methano-naphthalen-5-yl]-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide), as the sum of its *syn*-isomer (3-(difluoromethyl)-1-methyl-*N*-[(1RS, 4SR, 9RS)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-(1-methylethyl)-1,4-methanonaphthalen-5-yl]-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide) and *anti*-isomer (3-(difluoromethyl)-1-methyl-*N*-[(1RS, 4SR, 9SR)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-(1-methylethyl)-1,4-methano-naphthalen-5-yl]-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide) in or on the commodity.
