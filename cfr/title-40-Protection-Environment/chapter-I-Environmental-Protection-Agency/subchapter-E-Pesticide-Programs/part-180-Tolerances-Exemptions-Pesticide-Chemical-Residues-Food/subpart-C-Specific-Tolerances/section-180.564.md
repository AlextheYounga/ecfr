##### ยง 180.564 Indoxacarb; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of indoxacarb, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only indoxacarb, (S)-methyl 7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]carbonyl]indeno[1,2-*e*][1,3,4][oxadiazine-4a(3*H*)-carboxylate, and its R-enantiomer, (R)-methyl 7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]carbonyl]indeno[1,2-*e*][1,3,4][oxadiazine-4a(3*H*)-carboxylate.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of indoxacarb, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of indoxacarb, (S)-methyl-7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)-phenyl]amino]carbonyl]indeno[1,2e] [1,3,4]oxadiazine-4a(3*H*)-carboxylate, its R-enantiomer, (R)-methyl 7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl]amino]carbonyl]indeno [1,2-e] [1,3,4] oxadiazine-4a(3*H*)-carboxylate, and the metabolites: IN-JT333, methyl 7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-amino]carbonyl]indeno[1,2-e][1,3,4]oxadiazine-4a(3*H*)-carboxylate; IN-KT319, (E)-methyl 5-chloro-2,3,-dihydro-2-hydroxy-1-[[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]-carbonyl]hydrazono]-1*H*-indene-2-carboxylate; IN-JU873, methyl 5-chloro-2,3-dihydro-2-hydroxy-1-[[[[4-(triflurormethoxy)-phenyl]amino]carbonyl]hydrazono]-1*H*-indene-2-carboxylate; IN-KG433, methyl 5-chloro-2,3,-dihydro-2-hydroxy-1-[[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]carbonyl]-hydrazono]-1*H*-indene-2-carboxylate; and IN-KB687, methyl [4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]carbamate, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of indoxacarb in the commodity.

(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* Time-limited tolerances specified in the following table are established for residues of the indoxacarb, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the specified agricultural commodities in the table below, resulting from use of the pesticide pursuant to FIFRA section 18 emergency exemptions. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the table below is to be determined by measuring only indoxacarb, (S)-methyl 7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]carbonyl]indeno[1,2-e][1,3,4][oxadiazine-4a(3H)-carboxylate, and its R-enantiomer, (R)-methyl 7-chloro-2,5-dihydro-2-[[(methoxycarbonyl)[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]amino]carbonyl]indeno[1,2-e][1,3,4][oxadiazine-4a(3H)-carboxylate.

The tolerances expire on the dates specified in the table.
