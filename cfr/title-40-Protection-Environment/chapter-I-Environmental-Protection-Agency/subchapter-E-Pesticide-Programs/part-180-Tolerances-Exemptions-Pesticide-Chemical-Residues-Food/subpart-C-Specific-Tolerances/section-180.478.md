##### ยง 180.478 Rimsulfuron; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide rimsulfuron, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only rimsulfuron, N-[[(4,6-dimethoxy-2-pyrimidinyl)amino] carbonyl]-3-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-pyridinesulfonamide.
