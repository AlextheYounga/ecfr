(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* Time-limited tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide boscalid, including its metabolites and degradates, in connection with use of the pesticide under section 18 emergency exemptions granted by EPA. Compliance with the tolerance level specified below is to be determined by measuring only boscalid, 3-pyridinecarboxamide, 2-chloro-*N*-(4′-chloro[1,1′-biphenyl]-2-yl). This tolerance will expire and is revoked on the date specified in the following table:
