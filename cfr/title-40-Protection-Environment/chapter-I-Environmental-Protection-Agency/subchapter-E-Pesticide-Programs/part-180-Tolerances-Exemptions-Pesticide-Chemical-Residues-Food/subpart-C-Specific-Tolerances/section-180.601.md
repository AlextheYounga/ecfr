##### ยง 180.601 Cyazofamid; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide cyazofamid, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of 4-chloro-2-cyano-*N*,*N*-dimethyl-5-(4-methylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-1-sulfonamide and its metabolite, 4-chloro-5-(4-methylphenyl)-1*H*-imidazole-2-carbonitrile, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of cyazofamid, in or on the following commodities:
