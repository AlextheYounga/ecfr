##### § 180.474 Tebuconazole; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of tebuconazole, alpha-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-alpha-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only tebuconazole [α-[2-(4-chlorophenyl) ethyl]-α-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol], in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide tebuconazole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of tebuconazole (alpha-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-alpha-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-1*H*-1,2,4-triazole-1-ethanol) and its diol metabolite (1-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-3-(1*H* -1,2,4-triazole-1-yl-methyl)-pentane-3,5-diol), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of tebuconzole, in or on the commodity.
