##### ยง 180.555 Trifloxystrobin; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of trifloxystrobin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of trifloxystrobin, benzeneacetic acid, (*E,E*)-ฮฑ-(methoxyimino)-2-[[[[1-[3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]ethylidene] amino]oxy]methyl]-, methyl ester, and the free form of its acid metabolite CGA-321113, (*E,E*)-methoxyimino-[2-[1-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-ethylideneaminooxymethyl]-phenyl]acetic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of trifloxystrobin, in or on the commodity.
