(2) Tolerances are established for residues of penthiopyrad, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of penthiopyrad (*N*-[2-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-3-thienyl]-1-methyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide) and its metabolite (1-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl-1H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of penthiopyrad, in or on the commodity.
