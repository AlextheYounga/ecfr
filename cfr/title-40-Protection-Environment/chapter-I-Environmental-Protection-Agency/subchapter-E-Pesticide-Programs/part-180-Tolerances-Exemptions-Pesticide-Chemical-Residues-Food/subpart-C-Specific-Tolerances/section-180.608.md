##### ยง 180.608 Spirodiclofen; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of spirodiclofen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed below. Compliance with the following tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only spirodiclofen (3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-3-en-4-yl 2,2-dimethylbutanoate).

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of spirodiclofen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed below. Compliance with the following tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only spirodiclofen (3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-oxo-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-3-en-4-yl 2,2-dimethylbutanoate) and its metabolite 3-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-1-oxaspiro[4,5] dec-3-en-2-one, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of spirodiclofen.
