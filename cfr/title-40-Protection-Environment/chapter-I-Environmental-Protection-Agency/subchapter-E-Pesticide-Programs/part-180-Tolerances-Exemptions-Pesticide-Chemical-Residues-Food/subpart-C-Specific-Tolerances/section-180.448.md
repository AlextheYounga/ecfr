##### ยง 180.448 Hexythiazox; tolerance for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of hexythiazox, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only hexythiazox and its metabolites containing the (4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-2-oxo-3-thiazolidine moiety, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of hexythiazox.
