##### § 180.586 Clothianidin; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide clothianidin, including its metabolites and degradates. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only clothianidin, (*E*)-*N*-[(2-Chloro-5-thiazolyl)methyl]-*N′* -methyl-*N″* -nitroguanidine, in or on the following raw agricultural commodities:

(2) Time-limited tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide clothianidin, including its metabolites and degradates. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only clothianidin, (E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine, in or on the following raw agricultural commodity:

|Commodity |Parts per million|Expiration/revocation date|
|----------|-----------------|--------------------------|
|Rice, seed|      0.01       |         6/23/12          |

(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* A time-limited tolerance specified in the following table is established for residues of clothianidin, *(E)*-*N*-[(2-chloro-5-thiazolyl)methyl]-*N'*-methyl-*N”*-nitroguanidine, in or on the specified agricultural commodity, resulting from use of the pesticide pursuant to FIFRA section 18 emergency exemptions. This tolerance expires on the date specified in the table.

(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]

(d) *Indirect and inadvertant residues.* Tolerances are established for the indirect or inadvertent residues of the insecticide clothianidin, including its metabolites and degradates. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only clothianidin, (E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine, in or on the following raw agricultural commodities when present therein as a result of the application of clothianidin to crops listed in paragraph (a) of this section:
