##### ยง 180.362 Fenbutatin-oxide; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the miticide/acaricide fenbutatin-oxide, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the plant commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only fenbutatin-oxide, hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane, in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the miticide/acaricide fenbutatin-oxide, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the animal commodities in the table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fenbutatin-oxide, hexakis (2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) distannoxane, and its organotin metabolites, dihydroxybis(2-methyl-2-phenylpropyl) stannane and 2-methyl-2-phenylpropylstannoic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fenbutatin-oxide, in or on the commodity.
