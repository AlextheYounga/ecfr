##### ยง 180.661 Fluopyram; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide Fluopyram, *N*-[2-[3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]ethyl]-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide, including its metabolites and degradates in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the table is to be determined by measuring only fluopyram in or on the commodity.
