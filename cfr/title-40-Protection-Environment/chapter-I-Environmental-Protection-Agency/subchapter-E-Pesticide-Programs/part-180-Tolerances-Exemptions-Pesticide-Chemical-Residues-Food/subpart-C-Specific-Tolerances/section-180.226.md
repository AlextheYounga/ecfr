##### § 180.226 Diquat; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for the residues of the herbicide diquat, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in Table 1 to this paragraph (a)(1) resulting from the application of the dibromide salt of diquat. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 1 to this paragraph (a)(1) is to be determined by measuring only diquat (6,7-dihydrodipyrido[1,2-a:2′,1′-c]pyrazinediium):
