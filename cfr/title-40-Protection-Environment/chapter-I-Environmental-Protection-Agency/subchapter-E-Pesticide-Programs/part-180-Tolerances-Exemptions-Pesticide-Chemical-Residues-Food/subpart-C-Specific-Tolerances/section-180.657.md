(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide metaflumizone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in table 1 to this paragraph (a)(1). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph (a)(1) is to be determined by measuring only the sum of metaflumizone (E and Z isomers; 2-[2-(4-cyanophenyl)-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]ethylidene]-*N*-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl] hydrazinecarboxamide) and its metabolite 4-{2-oxo-2-[3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]ethyl}-benzonitrile, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of metaflumizone, in or on the following commodities:
