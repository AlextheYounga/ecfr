##### ยง 180.469 Dichlormid; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of dichlormid, including its metabolites and degradates, when used as an inert ingredient (herbicide safener) in pesticide formulations, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerances is to be determined by measuring only dichlormid (2,2-dichloro-*N,N*-di-2-propenylacetamide).

|                   Commodity                   |Parts per million|
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|              Corn, field, forage              |      0.05       |
|              Corn, field, grain               |      0.05       |
|              Corn, field, stover              |      0.05       |
|               Corn, pop, grain                |      0.05       |
|               Corn, pop, stover               |      0.05       |
|              Corn, sweet, forage              |      0.05       |
|Corn, sweet, kernel plus cob with husks removed|      0.05       |
|              Corn, sweet, stover              |      0.05       |

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of dichlormid, including its metabolites and degradates, at 0.05 parts per million (ppm) when used as an inert ingredient (herbicide safener) in pesticide formulations containing metolachlor or S-metolachlor in or on raw agricultural commodities for which tolerances have been established for metolachlor or S-metolachlor. Compliance with the tolerances is to be determined by measuring only dichlormid (2,2-dichloro-*N,N*-di-2-propenylacetamide).

(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]

(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]

(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
