(a)(1) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of tolpyralate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only tolpyralate, 1-[[1-ethyl-4-[3-(2-methoxyethoxy)-2-methyl-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-1*H*-pyrazol-5-yl]oxy]ethyl methyl carbonate, in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of tolpyralate, 1-[[1-ethyl-4-[3-(2-methoxyethoxy)-2-methyl-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]oxy]ethyl methyl carbonate and metabolite MT-2153 [1-ethyl-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-4-yl-3-(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-mesyl-2-methylphenyl ketone], in or on the livestock commodities in table 2 to this paragraph (a)(2). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 2 to this paragraph (a)(2) is to be determined by measuring tolpyralate, 1-[[1-ethyl-4-[3-(2-methoxyethoxy)-2-methyl-4-(methylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]oxy]ethyl methyl carbonate and metabolite MT-2153 [1-ethyl-5-hydroxy-1H-pyrazol-4-yl-3-(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-mesyl-2-methylphenyl ketone], in or on the commodity.
