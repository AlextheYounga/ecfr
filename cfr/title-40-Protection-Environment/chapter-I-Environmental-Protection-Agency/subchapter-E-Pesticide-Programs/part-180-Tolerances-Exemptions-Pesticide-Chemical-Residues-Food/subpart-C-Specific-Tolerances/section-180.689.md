##### ยง 180.689 Aminocyclopyrachlor; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide aminocyclopyrachlor, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of aminocyclopyrachlor, 6-amino-5-chloro-2-cyclopropyl-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acid, and aminocyclopyrachlor methyl ester, methyl 6-amino-5-chloro-2-cyclopropyl-4-pyrimidinecarboxylate, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of aminocyclopyrachlor.
