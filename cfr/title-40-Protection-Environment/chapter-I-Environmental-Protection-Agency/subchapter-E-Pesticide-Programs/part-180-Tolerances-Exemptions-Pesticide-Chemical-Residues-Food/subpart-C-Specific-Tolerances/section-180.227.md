##### ยง 180.227 Dicamba; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for the residues of the herbicide dicamba (3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid), including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only the sum of the residues of dicamba (3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid) and its metabolite, 3,6-dichloro-5-hydroxy-*o*-anisic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of dicamba, in or on the following commodities:
