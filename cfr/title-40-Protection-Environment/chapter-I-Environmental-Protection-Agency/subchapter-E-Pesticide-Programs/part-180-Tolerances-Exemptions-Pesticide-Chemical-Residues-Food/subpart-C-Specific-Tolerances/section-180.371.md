##### ยง 180.371 Thiophanate-methyl; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of thiophanate-methyl, dimethyl ((1,2-phenylene) bis (iminocarbonothioyl)) bis(carbamate), including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only the sum of thiophanate-methyl, dimethyl ((1,2-phenylene) bis (iminocarbonothioyl)) bis(carbamate), and its metabolite, methyl 2-benzimidazoyl carbamate (MBC), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of thiophanate-methyl, in or on the commodity.
