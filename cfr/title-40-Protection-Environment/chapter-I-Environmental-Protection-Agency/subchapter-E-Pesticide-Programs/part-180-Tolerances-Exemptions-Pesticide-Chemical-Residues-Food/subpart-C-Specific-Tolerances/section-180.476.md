##### ยง 180.476 Triflumizole; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide triflumizole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the parent compound triflumizole, 1-(1-((4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)imino)-2-propoxyethyl)-1 *H* -imidazole, and its metabolites containing the 4-chloro-2-trifluoromethylaniline moiety, calculated as stoichiometric equivalent of the parent compound.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide triflumizole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities of animal origin listed in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the parent compound triflumizole, 1-(1-((4-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)imino)-2-propoxyethyl)-1 *H* -imidazole, the metabolite 4-chloro-2-hydroxy-6-trifluoromethylaniline sulfate, and other metabolites containing the 4-chloro-2-trifluoromethylaniline moiety, calculated as the parent compound.
