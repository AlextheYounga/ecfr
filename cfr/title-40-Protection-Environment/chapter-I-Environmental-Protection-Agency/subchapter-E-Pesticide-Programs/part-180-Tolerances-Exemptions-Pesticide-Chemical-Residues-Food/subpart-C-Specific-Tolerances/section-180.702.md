##### § 180.702 Bixafen; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide bixafen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only bixafen, *N*-(3,4-dichloro-5-fluorobiphenyl-2-yl)-3-(difluoromethyl)-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxamide, in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide bixafen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of bixafen, *N*-(3,4-dichloro-5-fluorobiphenyl-2-yl)-3-(difluoromethyl)-1-methylpyrazole-4-carboxamide, and its desmethyl metabolite, *N-*(3′,4′-dichloro-5-fluoro[1,1′-biphenyl]-2-yl)-3-(difluoromethyl)-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of bixafen, in or on the commodity.
