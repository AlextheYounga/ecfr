(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for the combined residues of the fungicide flutianil, including its metabolites and degradates in or on food commodities in Table 1 to this paragraph (a). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 1 is to be determined by measuring only flutianil, (2*Z*)-2-[2-fluoro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]sulfanyl-2-[3-(2-methoxyphenyl)thiazolidin-2-ylidene]acetonitrile in or on the following commodities:
