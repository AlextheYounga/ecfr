(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide methoxyfenozide, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of methoxyfenozide [3-methoxy-2-methylbenzoic acid 2-(3,5-dimethylbenzoyl)-2-(1,1-dimethylethyl) hydrazide] and its glucuronide metabolite (ฮฒ-D-Glucopyranuronic acid, 3-[[2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-(3,5-dimethylbenzoyl)-hydrazino]carbonyl]-2-methylphenyl-), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of methoxyfenozide.
