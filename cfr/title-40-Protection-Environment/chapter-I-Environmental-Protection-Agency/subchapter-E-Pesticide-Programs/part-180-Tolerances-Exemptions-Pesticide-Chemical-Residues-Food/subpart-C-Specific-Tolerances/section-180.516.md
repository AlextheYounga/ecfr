(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide fludioxonil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fludioxonil, 4-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-4-yl)-1-*H*-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile), and its metabolites converted to 2,2-difluoro-l,3-benzodioxole-4-carboxylic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fludioxonil.
