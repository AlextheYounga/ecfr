##### ยง 180.675 Tolfenpyrad; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide tolfenpyrad, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only tolfenpyrad (4-chloro-3-ethyl-1-methyl-*N*-[[4-(4-methylphenoxy)phenyl]methyl]-1*H*-pyrazole-5-carboxamide) in or on the commodity.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the insecticide tolfenpyrad, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of tolfenpyrad, 4-chloro-3-ethyl-1-methyl-*N*-[[4-(4-methylphenoxy)phenyl]methyl]-1*H*-pyrazole-5-carboxamide, and its metabolite 4-[4-[(4-chloro-3-ethyl-1-methylpyrazol-5-yl)carbonylamino-methyl]phenoxy]-benzoic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of tolfenpyrad.
