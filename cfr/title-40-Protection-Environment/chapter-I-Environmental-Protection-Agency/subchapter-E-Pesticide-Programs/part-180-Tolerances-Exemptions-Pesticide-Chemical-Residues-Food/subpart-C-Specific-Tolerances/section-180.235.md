(2) The tolerance of 0.1 part per million prescribed by 21 CFR 556.180 for negligible residues of 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate in hog, fat; hog, meat; hog, meat byproducts; and hog, skin covers both its use as an anthelmintic in swine feed and as an insecticide applied directly to swine.

(3) Dichlorvos may be present as a residue from application as an insecticide on packaged or bagged nonperishable processed food (see: 21 CFR 170.3(j)) in an amount in such food not in excess of 0.5 part per million (ppm). To assure safe use of the insecticide, its label and labeling shall conform to the label and labeling registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the usage employed shall conform with such label or labeling.

(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]

(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* [Reserved]

(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* [Reserved]
