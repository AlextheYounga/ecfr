##### ยง 180.417 Triclopyr; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide triclopyr, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below resulting from the application of the butoxyethyl ester of triclopyr, triethylamine salt of triclopyr, or choline salt of triclopyr. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only triclopyr, 2-[(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl)oxy]acetic acid.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide triclopyr, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below resulting from the application of the butoxyethyl ester of triclopyr, triethylamine salt of triclopyr, or choline salt of triclopyr. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring the combined residues of triclopyr, 2-[(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl)oxy]acetic acid, and its metabolite 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of triclopyr.

(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* Time-limited tolerances specified in the following table are established for residues of the triclopyr (2-[(3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl)oxy]acetic acid), including its metabolites and degradates in or on the specified agricultural commodities, resulting from use of the pesticide pursuant to FIFRA section 18 emergency exemptions. The tolerances expire on the date specified in the table.
