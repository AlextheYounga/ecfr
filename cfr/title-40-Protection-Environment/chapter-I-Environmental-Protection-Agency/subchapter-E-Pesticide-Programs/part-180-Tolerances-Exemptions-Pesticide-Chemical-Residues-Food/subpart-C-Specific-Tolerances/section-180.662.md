##### ยง 180.662 Trinexapac-ethyl; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the plant growth regulator, trinexapac-ethyl, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 1 to this paragraph (a). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 1 is to be determined by measuring only the free and conjugated forms of both trinexapac-ethyl, ethyl 4-(cyclopropylhydroxymethylene)-3,5-dioxocyclohexanecarboxylate and trinexapac, 4-(cyclopropylhydroxymethylene)-3,5-dioxocyclohexanecarboxylic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of trinexapac-ethyl, in or on the commodity.
