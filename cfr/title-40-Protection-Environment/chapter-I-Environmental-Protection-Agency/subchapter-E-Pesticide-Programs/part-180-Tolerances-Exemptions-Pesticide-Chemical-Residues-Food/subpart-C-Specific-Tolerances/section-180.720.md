##### ยง 180.720 Fluazaindolizine; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the nematicide fluazaindolizine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities to Table 1 of this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in Table 1 is to be determined by measuring only fluazaindolizine, 8-chloro-*N*-[(2-chloro-5-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-*a*]pyridine-2-carboxamide, in or on the commodity.
