##### ยง 180.568 Flumioxazin; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of flumioxazin, 2-[7-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-3-oxo-4-(2-propynyl)-2*H*-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1*H*-isoindole-1,3(2*H*)-dione, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only flumioxazin.
