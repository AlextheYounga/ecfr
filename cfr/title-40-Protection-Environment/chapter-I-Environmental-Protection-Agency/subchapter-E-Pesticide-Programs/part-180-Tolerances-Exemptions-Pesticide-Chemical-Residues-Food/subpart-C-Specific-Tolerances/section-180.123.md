(2) Inorganic bromide may be present as a residue in certain processed food in accordance with the following conditions:

(i) When inorganic bromide residues are present as a result of fumigation of the processed food with methyl bromide or from such fumigation in addition to the authorized use of methyl bromide on the source raw agricultural commodity, as provided for in this part, the total residues of inorganic bromides (calculated as Br) shall not exceed the following levels:

(A) 400 parts per million in or on egg, dried and herb, processed and spice.
