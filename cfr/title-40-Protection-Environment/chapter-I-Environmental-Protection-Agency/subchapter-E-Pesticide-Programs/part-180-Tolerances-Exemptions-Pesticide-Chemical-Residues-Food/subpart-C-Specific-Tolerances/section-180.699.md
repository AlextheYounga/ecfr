##### ยง 180.699 Pydiflumetofen; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of pydiflumetofen, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only pydiflumetofen (3-(difluoromethyl)-*N*-methoxy-1-methyl-*N*-[1-methyl-2-(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1*H*-pyrazole-4-carboxamide) in or on the commodity:
