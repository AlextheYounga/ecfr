##### § 180.213 Simazine; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established residues of the herbicide simazine, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 1 to this paragraph (a). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 1 to this paragraph (a) is to be determined by measuring only the sum of simazine, 6-chloro-N,N′-diethyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine, and its metabolites 6-chloro-N-ethyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine, and 6-chloro-1,3,5-triazine-2,4-diamine, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of simazine, in or on the commodity.
