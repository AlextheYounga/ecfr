##### ยง 180.355 Bentazon; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of bentazon, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring for only the sum of bentazon (3-(1-methylethyl)-1*H*-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3*H*)-one 2,2-dioxide), 6-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-1*H*-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3*H*)-one 2,2-dioxide, and 8-hydroxy-3-isopropyl-1*H*-2,1,3-benzothiadiazin-4(3*H*)-one 2,2-dioxide calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of bentazon.
