##### ยง 180.561 Acibenzolar-S-methyl; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of acibenzolar-*S*-methyl, benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid-*S*-methyl ester, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only those acibenzolar-*S*-methyl residues convertible to benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid (CGA-210007), expressed as the stoichiometric equivalent of acibenzolar-*S*-methyl, in or on the following raw agricultural commodities.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of acibenzolar- *S* -methyl, benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid- *S* -methyl ester, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only those acibenzolar- *S* -methyl residues convertible to benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-carboxylic acid (CGA-210007), expressed as the Stoichiometric equivalent of acibenzolar- *S* -methyl, in or on the following raw agricultural commodities.
