##### ยง 180.634 Tembotrione; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide tembotrione, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the table to this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of tembotrione, 2-[2-chloro-4-(methylsulfonyl)-3-[(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)methyl]benzoyl]-1,3-cyclohexanedione and its metabolite, 2-[2-chloro-4-(methylsulfonyl)-3-[(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy) methyl]benzoyl]-4,6-dihydroxy-1,3-cyclohexanedione, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of tembotrione, in or on the following commodities.

|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
|            Cattle, liver            |      0.40       |
|Cattle, meat byproducts, except liver|      0.07       |

|             Goat, liver             |      0.40       |
| Goat, meat byproducts, except liver |      0.07       |
|            Horse, liver             |      0.40       |
|Horse, meat byproducts, except liver |      0.07       |
|           Poultry, liver            |      0.07       |
|            Sheep, liver             |      0.40       |
|Sheep, meat byproducts, except liver |      0.07       |
