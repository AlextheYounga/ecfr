(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide, azoxystrobin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of azoxystrobin, [methyl(*E*)-2-(2-(6-(2-cyanophenoxy) pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl)-3-methoxyacrylate], and the Z-isomer of azoxystrobin [methyl(*Z*)-2-(2-(6-(2-cyanophenoxy)pyrimidin-4-yloxy)phenyl)-3 methoxyacrylate] in or on the commodity.
