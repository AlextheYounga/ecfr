(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* A tolerance with regional registrations, as defined in ยง 180.1(l), is established for residues of the fungicide mancozeb, (a coordination product of zinc ion and maneb (manganese ethylenebisdithiocarbamate)), including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodity in the following table in this paragraph. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph is to be determined by measuring only those mancozeb residues convertible to and expressed in terms of the degradate carbon disulfide.
