(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the fungicide cyprodinil, including its metabolites and degradates, in the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of cyprodinil 4-cyclopropyl-6-methyl-*N*-phenyl-2-pyrimidinamine and free and conjugated CGA-304075 4-(4-cyclopropyl-6-methyl-pyrimidin-2-ylamino)-phenol, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of cyprodinil.
