##### ยง 180.324 Bromoxynil; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide bromoxynil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring only bromoxynil, 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile, resulting from application of its octanoic and/or heptanoic acid ester, in or on the commodities.
