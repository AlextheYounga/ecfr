##### ยง 180.231 Dichlobenil; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of dichlobenil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table in this paragraph (a). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in this paragraph (a) is to be determined by measuring only the sum of dichlobenil (2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile) and its BAM metabolite (2,6-dichlorobenzamide), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of dichlobenil, in or on the commodity.
