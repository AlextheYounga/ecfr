(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of kasugamycin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities listed in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified is to be determined by measuring only kasugamycin (3-*O*-[2-amino-4-[(carboxyimino-methyl)amino]-2,3,4,6-tetradeoxy-α-*D*-*arabino*-hexopyranosyl]-*D*-*chiro*-inositol) in or on the commodity.

(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* Time-limited tolerances specified in the following table are established for residues of kasugamycin, including metabolites and degradates, in or on the specified agricultural commodities, resulting from use of the pesticide pursuant to FIFRA section 18 emergency exemptions. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified is to be determined by measuring only kasugamycin (3-O-[2-amino-4-[(carboxyimino-methyl)amino]-2,3,4,6-tetradeoxy-α-D-arabino-hexopyranosyl]-D-chiro-inositol) in or on the commodity. The tolerances expire on the date specified in the table.
