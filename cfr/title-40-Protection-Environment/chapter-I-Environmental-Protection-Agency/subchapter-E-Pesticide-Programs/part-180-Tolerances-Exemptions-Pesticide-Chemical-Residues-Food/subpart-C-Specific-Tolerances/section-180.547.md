##### § 180.547 Prohexadione calcium; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the growth regulator, prohexadione calcium, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only prohexadione calcium (calcium 3-oxido-5-oxo-4-propionylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylate)” in or on the following commodities.

(b) *Section 18 emergency exemptions.* [Reserved]

(c) *Tolerances with regional registrations.* Tolerances with regional registration are established for residues of the plant growth regulator, prohexadione calcium, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 2 in this paragraph (c). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 2 in this paragraph (c) is to be determined by measuring only prohexadione calcium (calcium 3-oxido-5-oxo-4-propionylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylate) in or on the following commodities.
