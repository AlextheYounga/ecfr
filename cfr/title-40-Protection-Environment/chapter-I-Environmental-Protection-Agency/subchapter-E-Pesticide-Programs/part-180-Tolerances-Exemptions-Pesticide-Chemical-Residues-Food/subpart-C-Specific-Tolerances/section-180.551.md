##### § 180.551 Fluthiacet-methyl; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) A tolerance is established for residues of the herbicide, fluthiacet-methyl, acetic acid [[2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-[(tetrahydro-3-oxo-1*H*,3*H*-[1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,4-α]pyridazin-1-ylidene)amino]phenyl]thio]-methyl ester, in or on the food commodity:

|                   Commodity                   |Parts per million|
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|              Corn, field, forage              |      0.050      |
|              Corn, field, grain               |      0.010      |
|              Corn, field, stover              |      0.050      |
|               Corn, pop, grain                |      0.010      |
|               Corn, pop, stover               |      0.050      |
|              Corn, sweet, forage              |      0.050      |
|Corn, sweet, kernel plus cob with husks removed|      0.010      |
|              Corn, sweet, stover              |      0.050      |
|                 Soybean, seed                 |      0.01       |

(2) A tolerance is established for the combined residues of the herbicide fluthiacet-methyland its acid metabolite: acetic acid, [[2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-[tetrahydro-3-oxo-1H,3H-[1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,4-α]pyridazin-1-ylidene)amino]phenyl]thio]-methyl ester, and its acid metabolite, acetic acid, [[2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-[(tetrahydro-3-oxo-1H,3H-[1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,4-α]pyridazin-1-ylidene)amino]phenyl]thio]- , in or on the following food commodities:

|       Commodity       |Parts per million|
|-----------------------|-----------------|
|Cotton, gin byproducts |      0.20       |
|Cotton, undelinted seed|      0.020      |
