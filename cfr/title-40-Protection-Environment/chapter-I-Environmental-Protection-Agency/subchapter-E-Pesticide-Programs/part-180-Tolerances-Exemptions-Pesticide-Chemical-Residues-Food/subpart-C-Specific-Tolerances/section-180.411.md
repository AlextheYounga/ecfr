##### § 180.411 Fluazifop-P-butyl; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide fluazifop-P-butyl, butyl (2*R*)-2-[4-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy]phenoxy]propanoate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 1 to this paragraph (a). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 1 is to be determined by measuring only those fluazifop-P-butyl residues convertible to fluazifop, 2-[4-[[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]oxy]phenoxy]propanoic acid, expressed as fluazifop, in or on the commodity”.
