##### § 180.569 Forchlorfenuron; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of forchlorfenuron, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only forchlorfenuron (*N*-(2-chloro-4-pyridinyl)-*N*-phenylurea).

(2) Temporary tolerances are established for residues of forchlorfenuron, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring on forchlorfenuron (*N*-(2-chloro-4-pyridinyl)-*N′*-phenylurea).
