##### ยง 180.680 Fluensulfone; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the nematicide fluensulfone, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table 1 to ยง 180.680. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of fluensulfone, 5-chloro-2-[(3,4,4-trifluoro-3-buten-1-yl)sulfonyl]thiazole and its metabolite, 3,4,4-trifluoro-but-3-ene-1-sulfonic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of fluensulfone, in or on the commodity.
