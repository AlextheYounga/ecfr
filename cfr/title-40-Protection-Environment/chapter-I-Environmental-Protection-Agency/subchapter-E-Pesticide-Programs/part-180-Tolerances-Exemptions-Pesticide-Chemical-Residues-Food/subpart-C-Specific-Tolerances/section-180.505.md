##### § 180.505 Emamectin; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for emamectin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of emamectin (a mixture of a minimum of 90% 4′-epi-methylamino-4′-deoxyavermectin B1a and maximum of 10% 4′-epi-methylamino-4′-deoxyavermectin B1b) and its metabolites 8,9-isomer of the B1a and B1b component of the parent (8,9-ZMA), or 4′-deoxy-4′-epi-amino-avermectin B1a and 4'-deoxy-4′-epi-amino-avermectin B1b; 4′-deoxy-4′-epi-amino avermectin B1a (AB1a); 4′-deoxy-4′-epi-(*N*-formyl-*N*-methyl)amino-avermectin (MFB1a); and 4′-deoxy-4′-epi-(*N*-formyl)amino-avermectin B1a (FAB1a), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of emamectin.

(2) Tolerances are established for emamectin, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the following table. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in the following table is to be determined by measuring only the sum of emamectin (MAB1a + MAB1b isomers) and the associated 8,9-Z isomers (8,9-ZB1a and 8,9-ZB1b).
