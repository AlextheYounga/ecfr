##### ยง 180.142 2,4-D; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide, plant regulator, and fungicide 2,4-D, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels is to be determined by measuring residues of 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), both free and conjugated, determined as the acid, in or on the following commodities:
