##### § 180.713 Tiafenacil; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide tiafenacil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only tiafenacil, methyl *N*-[2-[[2-chloro-5-[3,6-dihydro-3-methyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1(2*H*)-pyrimidinyl]-4-fluorophenyl]thio]-1-oxopropyl]-β-alaninate, in or on the following commodities:

|       Commodity       |Parts per  <br/>million|
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
|  Corn, field, grain   |         0.01          |
|   Corn, pop, grain    |         0.01          |
|Cottonseed subgroup 20C|          0.3          |
|         Grape         |         0.01          |
|     Soybean, seed     |         0.01          |
|     Wheat, grain      |         0.01          |

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide tiafenacil, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of tiafenacil, methyl *N*-[2-[[2-chloro-5-[3,6-dihydro-3-methyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1(2*H*)-pyrimidinyl]-4-fluorophenyl]thio]-1-oxopropyl]-β-alaninate and its metabolites 2-(2-chloro-4-fluoro-5-(3-methyl-2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2,3-dihydropyrimidin-1(6*H*)-yl)phenylsulfinyl)propanoic acid and 2-(2-chloro-5-(2,6-dioxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2,3-dihydropyrimidin-1(6*H*)-yl)-4-fluorophenylsulfinyl)propanoic acid, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of tiafenacil, in or on the following commodities:

|      Commodity       |Parts per  <br/>million|
|----------------------|-----------------------|
|Cotton, gin byproducts|           3           |
| Corn, field, forage  |         0.05          |
| Corn, field, stover  |         0.05          |
|  Corn, pop, stover   |         0.05          |
|   Soybean, forage    |         0.15          |
|     Soybean, hay     |          0.3          |
|    Wheat, forage     |         0.05          |
|      Wheat, hay      |         0.08          |
|     Wheat, straw     |         0.07          |
