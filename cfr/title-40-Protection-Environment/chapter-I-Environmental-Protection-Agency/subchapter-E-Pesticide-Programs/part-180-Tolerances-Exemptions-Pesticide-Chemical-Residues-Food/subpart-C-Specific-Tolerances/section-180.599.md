##### ยง 180.599 Acequinocyl; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of acequinocyl, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of acequinocyl [2-(acetyloxy)-3-dodecyl-1,4-naphthalenedione] and its metabolite, 2-dodecyl-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of acequinocyl, in or on the commodity.
