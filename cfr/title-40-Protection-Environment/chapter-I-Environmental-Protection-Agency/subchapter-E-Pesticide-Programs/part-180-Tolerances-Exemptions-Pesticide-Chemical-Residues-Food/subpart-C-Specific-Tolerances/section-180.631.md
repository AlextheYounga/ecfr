##### ยง 180.631 Pyrasulfotole; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* Tolerances are established for residues of the herbicide pyrasulfotole, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in the table below. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified below is to be determined by measuring only the sum of pyrasulfotole ((5-hydroxy-1,3-dimethyl-1*H*-pyrazol-4-yl)[2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanone) and its desmethyl metabolite (5-hydroxy-3-methyl-1*H*-pyrazol-4-yl)[2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanone), calculated as the stoichiometric equivalent of pyrasulfotole, in or on the commodities:
