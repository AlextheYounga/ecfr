##### § 180.473 Glufosinate; tolerances for residues. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Tolerances are established for residues of glufosinate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 1 to paragraph (a)(1). Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 1 to paragraph (a)(1) is to be determined by measuring the sum of glufosinate (2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid) and its metabolites, 2-(acetylamino)-4-(hydroxymethyl phosphinyl) butanoic acid, and 3-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl) propanoic acid, expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid equivalents.

(2) Tolerances are established for residues of glufosinate-P, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 2 to paragraph (a)(2), as a result of applications of glufosinate-P or glufosinate-P-ammonium to those commodities. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 2 to paragraph (a)(2) is to be determined by measuring the sum of glufosinate (2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl) butanoic acid) and its metabolites, 2-(acetylamino)-4-(hydroxymethyl phosphinyl) butanoic acid, and 3-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl) propanoic acid, expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid equivalents.

Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 3 to paragraph (c) is to be determined by measuring the sum of glufosinate, (2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid) and its metabolites, 2-(acetylamino)-4-(hydroxymethyl phosphinyl) butanoic acid, and 3-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl) propanoic acid, expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid equivalents.

| Grass, hay  |          0.2          |

(d) *Indirect or inadvertent residues.* (1) Tolerances are established for indirect or inadvertent residues of glufosinate, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 4 to paragraph (d)(1), as a result of the application of glufosinate to crops listed in paragraph (a) of this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 4 to paragraph (d)(1) is to be determined by measuring the sum of glufosinate (2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl) butanoic acid) and its metabolite, 3-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl) propanoic acid, expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid equivalents.

(2) Tolerances are established for indirect or inadvertent residues of glufosinate-P, including its metabolites and degradates, in or on the commodities in table 5 to paragraph (d)(2), as a result of the application of glufosinate-P or glufosinate-P-ammonium to crops listed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Compliance with the tolerance levels specified in table 5 to paragraph (d)(2) is to be determined by measuring the sum of glufosinate (2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl) butanoic acid) and its metabolite, 3-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl) propanoic acid, expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)butanoic acid equivalents.”
