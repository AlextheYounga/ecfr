(e) *Test notes.* The following test notes are applicable to the data requirements for biochemical pesticides product chemistry and are referenced in the last column of the table in paragraph (d) of this section.

1. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.320.

2. If the MP and EP are produced by an integrated formulation system (non-registered source), these data are also required on TGAI.

3. Data must be provided in accordance with §§ 158.325, 158.330, and § 158.335.

4. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.340.

5. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.345. Also, required to support the registration of each manufacturing-use product (including registered TGAIs) and end-use products produced by an integrated formulation system. Data on other end-use products would be required on a case-by-case basis.

6. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.350.

7. Data must be provided in accordance with § 158.355.

8. If the TGAI cannot be isolated, data are required on the practical equivalent of the TGAI. EP testing may also be appropriate.

9. Required if the product contains combustible liquids.

10. Required if the product is an emulsifiable liquid and is to be diluted with petroleum solvents.

11. Required if the test substance is soluble or dispersible in water.

12. Required if the product is a liquid.

13. Required when the technical chemical is a solid at room temperature.

14. Required when the technical chemical is a liquid at room temperature.

15. Required for water insoluble test substances (\>10−6g/l) and fibrous test substances with diameter ≥0.1 µm.

16. Required for organic chemicals unless they dissociate in water or are partially or completely soluble in water.

17. Data on the stability to metals and metal ions is required only if the active ingredient is expected to come in contact with either material during storage.

18. True density or specific density are required for all test substances. Data on bulk density is required for MPs or EPs that are solid at room temperature.

19. Not required for salts.
