|         Structural Protection, except Baits          |  95% prevention of damage to wood ≥5 years.   |
|        Structural Protection: Bait Treatment         |  95% prevention of damage to wood ≥3 years.   |

(d) *Colony Claims.* For colony claims, testing must be done for each species listed or each representative species, in the case of a group.

(e) *Bait products or claims involving outdoor use.* The group and sub-group claims in paragraph (b) of this section are for direct kill and residual surface application claims against foraging ants only (excluding colony claims). For bait products or claims involving outdoor use, testing must be specific to the species listed or each representative species, in the case of a group.
