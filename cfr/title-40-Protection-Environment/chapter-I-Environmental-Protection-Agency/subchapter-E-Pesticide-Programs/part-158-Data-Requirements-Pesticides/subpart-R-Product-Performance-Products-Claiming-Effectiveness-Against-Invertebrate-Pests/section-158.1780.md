(c) *Colony claims.* For colony claims, except *Vespula* spp., testing must be specific to the species listed. Acceptable data for any *Vespula* species may support a yellowjacket colony claim for ground nesting *Vespula* species; however, species-specific claims need to be supported by data from testing of the specific species. Colony claims have a performance standard of 100%.
