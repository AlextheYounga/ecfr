##### § 158.630 Terrestrial and aquatic nontarget organisms data requirements table. #####

(a) *General.* Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the terrestrial and aquatic nontarget data requirements for a particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test including specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.

(b) *Use patterns.* (1) The terrestrial use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop, terrestrial feed crop, and terrestrial nonfood crop. The aquatic use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of aquatic food crop and aquatic nonfood use patterns. The greenhouse use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of greenhouse food crop and greenhouse nonfood crop. The indoor use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of indoor food and indoor nonfood use.

(2) Data are also required for the general use patterns of forestry and residential outdoor use.

(3) In general, for all outdoor end-uses, including turf, the following studies are required: Two avian oral LD50, two avian dietary LC50, two avian reproduction studies, two freshwater fish LC50, one freshwater invertebrate EC50, one honeybee acute contact LD50, one freshwater fish early-life stage, one freshwater invertebrate life cycle, and three estuarine acute LC50/EC50 studies — fish, mollusk and invertebrate. All other outdoor residential uses, *i.e.*, gardens and ornamental will not usually require the freshwater fish early-life stage, the freshwater invertebrate life-cycle, and the acute estuarine tests.

(c) *Key.* R = Required; CR = Conditionally required; NR = Not required; TGAI = Technical grade of the active ingredient; TEP = Typical end-use product; PAI = Pure active ingredient; EP = end-use product. Commas between the test substances (*i.e.*, TGAI, TEP) indicate that data may be required on the TGAI or the TEP depending on the conditions set forth in the test note.

(d) *Table.* The following table shows the data requirements for nontarget terrestrial and aquatic organism. The table notes are shown in paragraph (e) of this section.

(e) *Test notes.* The following test notes apply to terrestrial and aquatic nontarget organisms data requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:

1. Data using the TGAI are required to support all outdoor end-use product uses including, but not limited to turf. Data are generally not required to support end-use products in the form of a gas, a highly volatile liquid, a highly reactive solid, or a highly corrosive material.

2. For greenhouse and indoor end-use products, data using the TGAI are required to support manufacturing-use products to be reformulated into these same end-use products or to support end-use products when there is no registered manufacturing-use product. Avian acute oral data are not required for liquid formulations for greenhouse and indoor uses. The study is not required if there is no potential for environmental exposure.

3. Data are required on one passerine species and either one waterfowl species or one upland game bird species for terrestrial, aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. Data are preferred on waterfowl or upland game bird species for indoor and greenhouse uses.

4. Data are required on waterfowl and upland game bird species.

5. Tests are required based on the results of lower tier toxicology studies, such as the acute and subacute testing, intended use pattern, and environmental fate characteristics that indicate potential exposure.

6. Higher tier testing may be required for a specific use pattern when a refined risk assessment indicates a concern based on laboratory toxicity endpoints and refined exposure assessments.

7. Environmental chemistry methods used to generate data associated with this study must include results of a successful confirmatory method trial by an independent laboratory. Test standards and procedures for independent laboratory validation are available as addenda to the guideline for this test requirement.

8. Data are required on one coldwater fish and one warmwater fish for terrestrial, aquatic, forestry, and residential outdoor uses. For indoor and greenhouse uses, testing with only one of either fish species is required.

9. EP or TEP testing is required for any product which meets any of the following conditions:

i. The end-use pesticide will be introduced directly into an aquatic environment (e.g., aquatic herbicides and mosquito larvicides) when used as directed.

ii. The maximum expected environmental concentration (MEEC) or the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in the aquatic environment is ≥one-half the LC50 or EC50 of the TGAI when the EP is used as directed.

iii. An ingredient in the end-use formulation other than the active ingredient is expected to enhance the toxicity of the active ingredient or to cause toxicity to aquatic organisms.

10. Data are required on one freshwater aquatic invertebrate species.

11. Data are required on one estuarine/marine mollusk, one estuarine/marine invertebrate and one estuarine/marine fish species.

12. Data are generally not required for outdoor residential uses, other than turf, unless data indicate that pesticide residues from the proposed use(s) can potentially enter waterways.

13. Data are required on one freshwater fish species. If the test species is different from the two species used for the freshwater fish acute toxicity tests, a 96-hour LC50 on that species must also be provided.

14. Data are required on one estuarine/marine invertebrate species.

15. Data are required on estuarine/marine species if the product meets any of the following conditions:

i. Intended for direct application to the estuarine or marine environment.

ii. Expected to enter this environment in significant concentrations because of its expected use or mobility patterns.

iii. If the acute LC50 or EC50 \<1 milligram/liter (mg/l).

iv. If the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in water is ≥0.01 of the acute EC50 or LC50 or if any of the following conditions exist:

A. Studies of other organisms indicate the reproductive physiology of fish and/or invertebrates may be affected.

B. Physicochemical properties indicate bioaccumulation of the pesticide.

C. The pesticide is persistent in water (e.g., half-life in water \>4 days).

16. Data are required on one estuarine/marine fish species.

17. Data are required on estuarine/marine species if the product is intended for direct application to the estuarine or marine environment, or the product is expected to enter this environment in significant concentrations because of its expected use or mobility patterns.

18. Data are required on freshwater species if the end-use product is intended to be applied directly to water, or is expected to be transported to water from the intended use site, and when any of the following conditions apply:

i. If the estimated environmental concentration (EEC) is ≥0.1 of the no-observed-effect level in the fish early-life stage or invertebrate life cycle test;

ii. If studies of other organisms indicate that the reproductive physiology of fish may be affected.

19. Not required when:

i. The octanol/water partition coefficients of the pesticide and its major degradates are \<1,000; or

ii. There are no potential exposures to fish and other nontarget aquatic organisms; or

iii. The hydrolytic half-life is \<5 days at pH 5, 7 and 9.

20. Data are required based on the results of lower tier studies such as acute and chronic aquatic organism testing, intended use pattern, and environmental fate characteristics that indicate significant potential exposure.

21. Data are required if:

i. The half-life of the pesticide in the sediment is ≤10 days in either the aerobic soil or aquatic metabolism studies and if any of the following conditions exist:

A. The soil partition coefficient (Kd) is ≥50.

B. The log Kow is ≥3.

C. The Koc ≥1,000.

ii. Registrants must consult with the Agency on appropriate test protocols prior to designing the study.

22. Data are required if:

i. The estimated environmental concentration (EEC) in sediment is \>0.1 of the acute LC50/EC50 values and

ii. The half-life of the pesticide in the sediment is \>10 days in either the aerobic soil or aquatic metabolism studies and if any of the following conditions exist:

A. The soil partition coefficient (Kd) is ≥50.

B. The log Kow is ≥3.

C. The Koc ≥1,000.

iii. Registrants must consult with the Agency on appropriate test protocols prior to designing the study.

23. Sediment testing with estuarine/marine test species is required if the product is intended for direct application to the estuarine or marine environment or the product is expected to enter this environment in concentrations which the Agency believes to be significant, either by runoff or erosion, because of its expected use or mobility pattern.

24. Data are required only when the formulation contains one or more active ingredients having an acute LD50 of \<11 micrograms per bee as determined in the honey bee acute contact study and the use pattern(s) indicate(s) that honey bees may be exposed to the pesticide.

25. Required if any of the following conditions are met:

i. Data from other sources (Experimental Use Permit program, university research, registrant submittals, etc.) indicate potential adverse effects on colonies, especially effects other than acute mortality (reproductive, behavioral, etc.);

ii. Data from residual toxicity studies indicate extended residual toxicity.

iii. Data derived from studies with terrestrial arthropods other than bees indicate potential chronic, reproductive or behavioral effects.

26. The freshwater fish test species for the TEP testing is the most sensitive of the species tested with the TGAI. Freshwater invertebrate and acute estuarine and marine organisms must also be tested with the EP or TEP using the same species tested with the TGAI.
