##### ยง 158.400 Product performance data requirements table. #####

(a) *General.* Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the product performance data requirements for a particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test, including specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.

(b) *Use patterns.* The terrestrial use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop and terrestrial nonfood crop. The aquatic use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of aquatic food crop and aquatic nonfood. The greenhouse use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of greenhouse food crop and greenhouse nonfood crop. Data are also required for the general use patterns of forestry use, residential outdoor use, and indoor use, which includes both food and nonfood uses.

(c) *Key.* CR = Conditionally required; NR = Not required; R = Required; EP = End-use product; MP = Manufacturing-use product; TEP = Typical end-use product.

(e) *Test notes.* The following notes appy to the data requirements table in paragraph (d) of this section.

1. The Agency has waived the requirement to submit product performance data unless the pesticide product bears a claim to control pest microorganisms that pose a threat to human health and whose presence cannot readily be observed by the user including, but not limited to, microorganisms infectious to man in any area of the inanimate environment, or a claim to control vertebrates (such as rodents, birds, bats, canids, and skunks) that may directly or indirectly transmit diseases to humans. However each registrant must ensure through testing that his product is efficacious when used in accordance with label directions and commonly accepted pest control practices. The Agency reserves the right to require, on a case-by-case basis, submission of product performance data for any pesticide product registered or proposed for registration.

2. [Reserved]
