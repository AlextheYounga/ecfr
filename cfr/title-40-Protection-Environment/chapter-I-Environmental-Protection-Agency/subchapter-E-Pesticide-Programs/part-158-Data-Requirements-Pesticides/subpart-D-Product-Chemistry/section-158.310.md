##### § 158.310 Product chemistry data requirements table. #####

(a) *General.* Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the product chemistry data requirements for a particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test and include specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (f) of the section.

(b) *Use patterns.* Product chemistry data are required for all pesticide products and are not use-specific.

(c) *Test substance.* Data requirements that list only the manufacturing-use product as the test substance apply to products containing solely the technical grade of the active ingredient and manufacturing-use products to which other ingredients have been intentionally added.

(d) *Key.* R = Required; CR = Conditionally required; MP = Manufacturing-use product; NR = Not required; EP = End-use product; TGAI = Technical grade of the active ingredient; PAI = Pure active ingredient.

(e) *Table.* The following table shows the data requirements for product chemistry. The table notes are shown in paragraph (f) of this section.

18. Required when the test substance is soluble or dispersible in water.

19. Required when the product is a liquid.

20. Required when the TGAI is solid at room temperature.

21. Required when the TGAI is liquid at room temperature.

22. Required when the test substance contains an acid or base functionality (organic or inorganic) or an alcoholic functionality (organic).

23. Required for water insoluble test substances (\>10−6 g/l) and fibrous test substances with diameter of ≥0.1 µm.

24. Required if technical chemical is organic and non-polar.

25. Not required for salts.

26. Data on stability of the MP and TGAI to storage at normal temperatures are required. Data on the stability of the TGAI to high temperatures are required if the TGAI is expected to be subjected to temperatures \>50 °C (122 °F) during production or storage.
