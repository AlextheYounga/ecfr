##### ยง 158.1100 Spray drift data requirements table. #####

(a) *General.* Sections 158.100 through 158.130 describe how to use this table to determine the spray drift data requirements for a particular pesticide product. Notes that apply to an individual test, including specific conditions, qualifications, or exceptions to the designated test are listed in paragraph (e) of this section.

(b) *Use patterns.* The terrestrial use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of terrestrial food crop and terrestrial nonfood crop. The aquatic use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of aquatic food crop and aquatic nonfood. The greenhouse use pattern includes products classified under the general use patterns of greenhouse food crop and greenhouse nonfood crop. Data are also required for the general use patterns of forestry use, residential outdoor use, and indoor use.

(c) *Key.* CR = Conditionally required; NR = Not required; TEP = Typical end-use product; MP = Manufacturing use product; EP = End-use product.

(d) *Table.* The following table lists the data requirements that pertain to spray drift. The table notes are shown in paragraph (e) of this section.

|Guideline Number|  Data Requirement   |Use Pattern|Test substance|   Test Note No.   |            |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

(e) *Test notes.* The following notes apply to the requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:

1. This study is required when aerial applications (rotary and fixed winged) and mist blower or other methods of ground application are proposed and it is estimated that the detrimental effect level of those nontarget organisms expected to be present would be exceeded. The nontarget organisms include humans, domestic animals, fish and wildlife, and nontarget plants.
