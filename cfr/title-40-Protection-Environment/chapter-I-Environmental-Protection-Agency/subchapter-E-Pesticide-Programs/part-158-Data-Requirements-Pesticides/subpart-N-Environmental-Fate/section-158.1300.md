(e) *Test notes.* The following test notes apply to the requirements in the table to paragraph (d) of this section:

1. Study is required for indoor uses in cases where environmental exposure is likely to occur. Such sites include, but are not limited to, agricultural premises, in or around farm buildings, barnyards, and beehives.

2. Not required when the electronic absorption spectra, measured at pHs 5, 7, and 9, of the chemical and its hydrolytic products, if any, show no absorption or tailing between 290 and 800 nm.

3. Not required when the chemical is to be applied only by soil injection or is incorporated in the soil.

4. Requirement based on use patterns and other pertinent factors including, but not limited to, the Henry's Law Constant of the chemical. In view of methodological difficulties with the study of photodegradation in air, prior consultation with the Agency regarding the protocol is recommended before the test is performed.

5. Required for aquatic food and nonfood crop uses for aquatic sites that are intermittently dry. Such sites include, but are not limited to, cranberry bogs and rice paddies.

6. Adsorption and desorption using a batch equilibrium method is preferred. However in some cases, for example, where the pesticide degrades rapidly, soil column leaching with unaged or aged columns may be more appropriate to fully characterize the potential mobility of the parent compound and major transformation products.

7. Environmental chemistry methods used to generate data associated with this study must include results of a successful confirmatory method trial by an independent laboratory. Test standards and procedures for independent laboratory validation are available as addenda to the guideline for this test requirement.

8. Requirement for terrestrial uses is based on potential for aquatic exposure and if pesticide residues have the potential for persistence, mobility, nontarget aquatic toxicity or bioaccumulation. Not required for aquatic residential uses. Field testing under the terrestrial field dissipation requirement may be more appropriate for some aquatic food crops, such as rice and cranberry uses, that are managed to have a dry-land period for production. The registrant is encouraged to consult with the Agency on protocols.

9. Agency approval of a protocol is necessary prior to initiation of the study.

10. This study may be triggered if there is specific evidence that the presence of one pesticide can affect the dissipation characteristics of another pesticide when applied simultaneously or serially.

11. Required if the weight-of-evidence indicates that the pesticide and/or its degradates is likely to leach to ground water, taking into account other factors such as the toxicity of the chemicals(s), available monitoring data, and the vulnerability of ground water resources in the pesticide use area.

12. If the terrestrial dissipation study cannot assess all of the major routes of dissipation, the forestry study will be required.
