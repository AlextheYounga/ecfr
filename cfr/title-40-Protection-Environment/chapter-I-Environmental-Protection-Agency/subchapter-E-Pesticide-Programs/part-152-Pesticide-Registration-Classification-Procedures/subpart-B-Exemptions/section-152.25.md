##### § 152.25 Exemptions for pesticides of a character not requiring FIFRA regulation. #####

The pesticides or classes of pesticides listed in this section have been determined to be of a character not requiring regulation under FIFRA, and are therefore exempt from all provisions of FIFRA when intended for use, and used, only in the manner specified.

(a) *Treated articles or substances.* An article or substance treated with, or containing, a pesticide to protect the article or substance itself (for example, paint treated with a pesticide to protect the paint coating, or wood products treated to protect the wood against insect or fungus infestation), if the pesticide is registered for such use.

(b) *Pheromones and pheromone traps.* Pheromones and identical or substantially similar compounds labeled for use only in pheromone traps (or labeled for use in a manner which the Administrator determines poses no greater risk of adverse effects on the environment than use in pheromone traps), and pheromone traps in which those compounds are the sole active ingredient(s).

(1) For the purposes of this paragraph, a pheromone is a compound produced by an arthropod which, alone or in combination with other such compounds, modifies the behavior of other individuals of the same species.

(2) For the purposes of this paragraph, a synthetically produced compound is identical to a pheromone only when their molecular structures are identical, or when the only differences between the molecular structures are between the stereochemical isomer ratios of the two compounds, except that a synthetic compound found to have toxicological properties significantly different from a pheromone is not identical.

(3) When a compound possesses many characteristics of a pheromone but does not meet the criteria in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it may, after review by the Agency, be deemed a substantially similar compound.

(4) For the purposes of this paragraph, a pheromone trap is a device containing a pheromone or an identical or substantially similar compound used for the sole purpose of attracting, and trapping or killing, target arthropods. Pheromone traps are intended to achieve pest control by removal of target organisms from their natural environment and do not result in increased levels of pheromones or identical or substantially similar compounds over a significant fraction of the treated area.

(c) *Preservatives for biological specimens.* (1) Embalming fluids.

(2) Products used to preserve animal or animal organ specimens, in mortuaries, laboratories, hospitals, museums and institutions of learning.

(3) Products used to preserve the integrity of milk, urine, blood, or other body fluids for laboratory analysis.

(d) *Foods.* Products consisting of foods and containing no active ingredients, which are used to attract pests.

(e) *Natural cedar.* (1) Natural cedar blocks, chips, shavings, balls, chests, drawer liners, paneling, and needles that meet all of the following criteria:

(i) The product consists totally of cedarwood or natural cedar.

(ii) The product is not treated, combined, or impregnated with any additional substance(s).

(iii) The product bears claims or directions for use solely to repel arthropods other than ticks or to retard mildew, and no additional claims are made in sale or distribution. The labeling must be limited to specific arthropods, or must exclude ticks if any general term such as “arthropods,” “insects,” “bugs,” or any other broad inclusive term, is used. The exemption does not apply to natural cedar products claimed to repel ticks.

(2) The exemption does not apply to cedar oil, or formulated products which contain cedar oil, other cedar extracts, or ground cedar wood as part of a mixture.

(f) *Minimum risk pesticides*—(1) *Exempted products.* Products containing the following active ingredients, alone or in combination with other substances listed in table 1 of this paragraph, are exempt from the requirements of FIFRA provided that all of the criteria of this section are met. All listed active ingredients may be used in non-food use products. Under section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and EPA (FFDCA) implementing regulations at part 180 of this chapter, food and animal feed in commerce can bear pesticide residues only for those ingredients that have tolerances or tolerance exemptions in part 180 of this chapter. Such tolerances or exemptions may be found, for example, in §§ 180.950, 180.1071, 180.1087, 180.1233, and 180.1251 of this chapter.
