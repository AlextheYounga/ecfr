##### § 77.1 Definitions that apply to all Department programs. #####

(a) [Reserved]

(b) Unless a statute or regulation provides otherwise, the following definitions in 2 CFR part 200 apply to the regulations in title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

*Contract* (2 CFR 200.22).

*Equipment* (2 CFR 200.33).

*Federal award* (2 CFR 200.38) (The terms “award,” “grant,” and “subgrant”, as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, have the same meaning, depending on the context, as “Federal award” in 2 CFR 200.38.).

*Period of performance* (2 CFR 200.77) (For discretionary grants, ED uses the term “project period,” as defined in paragraph (c) of this section, instead of “period of performance” to describe the period during which funds can be obligated.).

*Personal property* (2 CFR 200.78).

*Real property* (2 CFR 200.85).

*Recipient* (2 CFR 200.86).

*EDGAR* means the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (34 CFR parts 75, 76, 77, 79, 81, 82, 84, 86, 97, 98, and 99).

*Elementary school* means a day or residential school that provides elementary education, as determined under State law.

*Evidence of promise* means there is empirical evidence to support the theoretical linkage(s) between at least one critical component and at least one relevant outcome presented in the logic model for the proposed process, product, strategy, or practice. Specifically, evidence of promise means the conditions in both paragraphs (i) and (ii) of this definition are met:

(i) There is at least one study that is a -

(A) Correlational study with statistical controls for selection bias;

(B) Quasi-experimental design study that meets the What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards with reservations; or

(C) Randomized controlled trial that meets the What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards with or without reservations.

(ii) The study referenced in paragraph (i) of this definition found a statistically significant or substantively important (defined as a difference of 0.25 standard deviations or larger) favorable association between at least one critical component and one relevant outcome presented in the logic model for the proposed process, product, strategy, or practice.

*Facilities* means one or more structures in one or more locations.

*Fiscal year* means the Federal fiscal year - a period beginning on October 1 and ending on the following September 30.

*GEPA* means The General Education Provisions Act.

*Grant* means financial assistance, including cooperative agreements, that provides support or stimulation to accomplish a public purpose. 2 CFR part 200, as adopted in 2 CFR part 3474, uses the broader, undefined term “Award” to cover grants, subgrants, and other agreements in the form of money or property, in lieu of money, by the Federal Government to an eligible recipient. The term does not include -

(1) Technical assistance, which provides services instead of money;

(2) Other assistance in the form of loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies, or insurance;

(4) Contracts that are required to be entered into and administered under procurement laws and regulations.

*Grantee* means the legal entity to which a grant is awarded and that is accountable to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided. The grantee is the entire legal entity even if only a particular component of the entity is designated in the grant award notice (GAN). For example, a GAN may name as the grantee one school or campus of a university. In this case, the granting agency usually intends, or actually intends, that the named component assume primary or sole responsibility for administering the grant-assisted project or program. Nevertheless, the naming of a component of a legal entity as the grantee in a grant award document shall not be construed as relieving the whole legal entity from accountability to the Federal Government for the use of the funds provided. (This definition is not intended to affect the eligibility provision of grant programs in which eligibility is limited to organizations that may be only components of a legal entity.) The term “grantee” does not include any secondary recipients, such as subgrantees and contractors, that may receive funds from a grantee pursuant to a subgrant or contract.

*Grant period* means the period for which funds have been awarded.

*Large sample* means an analytic sample of 350 or more students (or other single analysis units), or 50 or more groups (such as classrooms or schools) that contain 10 or more students (or other single analysis units).

*Local educational agency* means:

(a) A public board of education or other public authority legally constituted within a State for either administrative control of or direction of, or to perform service functions for, public elementary or secondary schools in:

(1) A city, county, township, school district, or other political subdivision of a State; or

(2) Such combination of school districts or counties a State recognizes as an administrative agency for its public elementary or secondary schools; or

(b) Any other public institution or agency that has administrative control and direction of a public elementary or secondary school.

(c) As used in 34 CFR parts 400, 408, 525, 526 and 527 (vocational education programs), the term also includes any other public institution or agency that has administrative control and direction of a vocational education program.

*Logic model* (also referred to as theory of action) means a well-specified conceptual framework that identifies key components of the proposed process, product, strategy, or practice (i.e., the active “ingredients” that are hypothesized to be critical to achieving the relevant outcomes) and describes the relationships among the key components and outcomes, theoretically and operationally.

*Minor remodeling* means minor alterations in a previously completed building. The term also includes the extension of utility lines, such as water and electricity, from points beyond the confines of the space in which the minor remodeling is undertaken but within the confines of the previously completed building. The term does not include building construction, stuctural alterations to buildings, building maintenance, or repairs.

*Moderate evidence of effectiveness* means one of the following conditions is met:

(i) There is at least one study of the effectiveness of the process, product, strategy, or practice being proposed that meets the What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards without reservations, found a statistically significant favorable impact on a relevant outcome (with no statistically significant and overriding unfavorable impacts on that outcome for relevant populations in the study or in other studies of the intervention reviewed by and reported on by the What Works Clearinghouse), and includes a sample that overlaps with the populations or settings proposed to receive the process, product, strategy, or practice.

(ii) There is at least one study of the effectiveness of the process, product, strategy, or practice being proposed that meets the What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards with reservations, found a statistically significant favorable impact on a relevant outcome (with no statistically significant and overriding unfavorable impacts on that outcome for relevant populations in the study or in other studies of the intervention reviewed by and reported on by the What Works Clearinghouse), includes a sample that overlaps with the populations or settings proposed to receive the process, product, strategy, or practice, and includes a large sample and a multi-site sample.

*Quasi-experimental design study* means a study using a design that attempts to approximate an experimental design by identifying a comparison group that is similar to the treatment group in important respects. These studies, depending on design and implementation, can meet What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards with reservations (but not What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards without reservations).

*Randomized controlled trial* means a study that employs random assignment of, for example, students, teachers, classrooms, schools, or districts to receive the intervention being evaluated (the treatment group) or not to receive the intervention (the control group). The estimated effectiveness of the intervention is the difference between the average outcomes for the treatment group and for the control group. These studies, depending on design and implementation, can meet What Works Clearinghouse Evidence Standards without reservations.

*Regional level* describes the level of scope or effectiveness of a process, product, strategy, or practice that is able to serve a variety of communities within a State or multiple States, including rural and urban areas, as well as with different groups (e.g., economically disadvantaged, racial and ethnic groups, migrant populations, individuals with disabilities, English learners, and individuals of each gender). For an LEA-based project, to be considered a regional-level project, a process, product, strategy, or practice must serve students in more than one LEA, unless the process, product, strategy, or practice is implemented in a State in which the State educational agency is the sole educational agency for all schools.
