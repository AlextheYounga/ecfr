Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 82128, Dec. 17, 2020.

(a) A faith-based organization that receives a grant, subgrant, or contract under a program of the Department supported in whole or in part by direct Federal financial assistance must give written notice to a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of certain protections. This notice must state that:

(1) The organization may not discriminate against a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;

(2) The organization may not require a beneficiary to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by the beneficiaries in such activities must be purely voluntary;

(3) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;

(4) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization, the organization will undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary has no objection; and

(5) A beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may report a violation of these protections to, or file a written complaint regarding a denial of services or benefits with, the subgrantee, grantee, or Department that made the award under which the violation or denial occurred.

(b)(1) A faith-based organization that receives a grant, subgrant, or contract under a program of the Department must provide beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries with the written notice required under paragraph (a) of this section prior to the time they enroll in or receive services from the organization.

(2) When the nature of the services provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide the written notice in advance of the actual services, the organization must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.

(c) The notice that a faith-based organization must use to notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their rights under paragraph (a) of this section is specified in appendix A to this part.
