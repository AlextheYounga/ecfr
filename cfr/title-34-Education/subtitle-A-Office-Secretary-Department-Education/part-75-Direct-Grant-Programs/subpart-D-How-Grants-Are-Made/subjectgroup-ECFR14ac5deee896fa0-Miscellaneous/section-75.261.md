(a) *General rule.* A grantee may extend the project period of an award one time for a period up to twelve months without the prior approval of the Secretary, if—

(1) The Knowledge Dissemination and Utilization Centers and Disability and Technical Assistance Centers authorized under 29 U.S.C. 761a(b)(2), (4), (5), (6), and (11) and implemented at 34 CFR part 350, subpart B, §§ 350.17-350.19.

(c) *Other regulations.* If ED regulations other than the regulations in 2 CFR part 200 or the conditions of the award require the grantee to obtain prior approval to extend the project period, the Secretary may permit the grantee to extend the project period if—

(1) The extension does not violate any statute or regulations;

(2) The extension does not involve the obligation of additional Federal funds;

(3) The extension is to carry out the activities in the approved application; and

(4)(i) The Secretary determines that, due to special or unusual circumstances applicable to a class of grantees, the project periods for the grantees should be extended; or

(ii)(A) The Secretary determines that special or unusual circumstances would delay completion of the project beyond the end of the project period;

(C) The grantee provides a written statement before the end of the project period giving the reasons why the extension is appropriate under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(A) of this section and the period for which the project needs extension.

(d) *Waiver.* The Secretary may waive the requirement in paragraph (a)(4)(ii)(B) of this section if—

(1) The grantee could not reasonably have known of the need for the extension on or before the start of the 45-day time period; or

(2) The failure to give notice on or before the start of the 45-day time period was unavoidable.
