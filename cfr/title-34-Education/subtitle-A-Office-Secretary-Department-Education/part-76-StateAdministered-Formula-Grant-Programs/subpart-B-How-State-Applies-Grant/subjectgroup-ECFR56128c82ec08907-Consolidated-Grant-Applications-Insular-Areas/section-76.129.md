##### ยง 76.129 How does a consolidated grant work? #####

(a) An Insular Area shall use the funds it receives under a consolidated grant to carry out, in its jurisdiction, one or more of the programs included in the grant.

Example 1 to paragraph (a). Assume that Guam receives, under the consolidated grant, funds from Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006, Title I, part A of the ESEA, and Title IV, part A of the ESEA. The sum of the allocations under these programs is $600,000. Guam may choose to allocate this $600,000 among one, two, or all three of the programs.

(b) An Insular Area shall comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to each program under which funds from the consolidated grant are expended.

Example 2 to paragraph (b). Assume that American Samoa uses part of the funds under a consolidated grant to carry out programs and activities under Title IV, part A of the ESEA. American Samoa need not submit to the Secretary a State plan that addresses the program's application requirement that the State educational agency describe how it will use funds for State-level activities. However, in carrying out the program, American Samoa must use the required amount of funds for State-level activities under the program.[47 FR 17421, Apr. 22, 1982, as amended at 89 FR 70335, Aug. 29, 2024]
