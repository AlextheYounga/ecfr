(b) *Other programs—hearings not required.* Under other programs covered by this part, a State agency—other than a State educational agency—is not required to provide an opportunity for a hearing regarding the agency's disapproval of an application.

(1) Disapproval of or failure to approve the application or project in whole or in part.

(2) Failure to provide funds in amounts in accordance with the requirements of statutes and regulations.

Note:

This section is based on a provision in the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). Section 427 of the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA), 20 U.S.C. 3487, provides that except to the extent inconsistent with the DEOA, the GEPA “shall apply to functions transferred by this Act to the extent applicable on the day preceding the effective date of this Act.” Although standardized nomenclature is used in this section to reflect the creation of the Department of Education, there is no intent to extend the coverage of the GEPA beyond that authorized under Section 427 or other applicable law.
