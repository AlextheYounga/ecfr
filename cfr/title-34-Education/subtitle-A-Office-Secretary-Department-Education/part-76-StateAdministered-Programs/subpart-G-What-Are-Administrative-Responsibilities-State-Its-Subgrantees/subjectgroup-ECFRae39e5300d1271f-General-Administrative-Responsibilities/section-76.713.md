Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 82130, Dec. 17, 2020.

(a) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of a State-administered program of the Department supported in whole or in part by direct Federal financial assistance objects to the religious character of a faith-based organization that provides services under the program, that organization must promptly undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary has no objection.

(b)(1) A faith-based organization may satisfy the requirement in paragraph (a) of this section by referring a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to another faith-based organization if the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary does not object to that provider.

(2) If the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary requests a secular provider, and one is available, the faith-based organization must make a referral to that provider.

(c) The faith-based organization must make a referral to an alternative provider that -

(1) Is in reasonable geographic proximity to the location where the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary is receiving or would receive services (except for services provided by telephone, internet, or similar means);

(2) Offers services that are similar in substance and quality to those offered by the organization; and

(3) Has the capacity to accept additional beneficiaries.

(d)(1) When a faith-based organization makes a referral to an alternative provider, the organization must maintain a record of the referral in its grant records, including the date of the referral, the name of the alternative provider, its address, and contact information for the alternative provider.

(2) When the organization determines that it is unable to identify an alternative provider, the organization must promptly notify the State or subgrantee that made the award under which the referral could not be made. If the organization is unable to identify an alternative provider, the State agency or subgrantee that made the award under which the referral could not be made must determine whether there is any other suitable alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary may be referred. If the entity that made the award under which the referral could not be made cannot make a referral, that entity must promptly notify the grantee or the Department, as appropriate, and the grantee or the Department must determine whether a suitable referral can be made.
