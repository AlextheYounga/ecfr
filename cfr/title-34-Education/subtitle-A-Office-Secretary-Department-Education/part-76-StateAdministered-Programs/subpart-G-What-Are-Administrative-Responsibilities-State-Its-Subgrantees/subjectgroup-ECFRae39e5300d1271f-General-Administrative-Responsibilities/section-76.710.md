##### § 76.710 Obligations made during a carryover period are subject to current statutes, regulations, and applications. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 70339, Aug. 29, 2024.

A State and a subgrantee shall use carryover funds in accordance with:

(a) The Federal statutes and regulations that apply to the program and are in effect for the carryover period; and

(b) Any State plan, or application for a subgrant, that the State or subgrantee is required to submit for the carryover period.

Note:

This section is based on a provision in the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA). Section 427 of the Department of Education Organization Act (DEOA), 20 U.S.C. 3487, provides that except to the extent inconsistent with the DEOA, the GEPA “shall apply to functions transferred by this Act to the extent applicable on the day preceding the effective date of this Act.” Although standardized nomenclature is used in this section to reflect the creation of the Department of Education, there is no intent to extend the coverage of the GEPA beyond that authorized under section 427 or other applicable law.
