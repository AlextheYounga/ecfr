Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 70338, Aug. 29, 2024.

(a) If the Department of Education is the cognizant agency, the Secretary approves an indirect cost rate for a State agency and for a subgrantee other than a local educational agency. For the purposes of this section, the term local educational agency does not include a State agency.

(b) Each State educational agency, on the basis of a plan approved by the Secretary, shall approve an indirect cost rate for each local educational agency that requests it to do so. These rates may be for periods longer than a year if rates are sufficiently stable to justify a longer period.

(c) The Secretary generally approves indirect cost rate agreements annually. Indirect cost rate agreements may be approved for periods longer than a year if the Secretary determines that rates will be sufficiently stable to justify a longer rate period.
