(c) The Secretary may establish a temporary indirect cost rate for a grantee that does not have an indirect cost rate agreement with its cognizant agency.

(d) The Secretary accepts an indirect cost rate negotiated by a grantee's cognizant agency, but may establish a restricted indirect cost rate for a grantee to satisfy the statutory requirements of certain programs administered by the Department.
