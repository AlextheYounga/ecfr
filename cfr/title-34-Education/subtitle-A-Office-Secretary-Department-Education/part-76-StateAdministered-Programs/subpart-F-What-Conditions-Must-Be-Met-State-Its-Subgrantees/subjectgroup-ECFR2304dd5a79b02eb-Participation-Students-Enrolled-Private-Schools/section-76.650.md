##### § 76.650 Private schools; purpose of §§ 76.651-76.662. #####

(a) Under some programs, the authorizing statute requires that a State and its subgrantees provide for participation by students enrolled in private schools. Sections 76.651-76.662 apply to those programs and provide rules for that participation. These sections do not affect the authority of the State or a subgrantee to enter into a contract with a private party.

(b) If any other rules for participation of students enrolled in private schools apply under a particular program, they are in the authorizing statute or implementing regulations for that program.

(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1221e-3 and 3474) Note:

Some program statutes authorize the Secretary—under certain circumstances—to provide benefits directly to private school students. These “bypass” provisions—where they apply—are implemented in the individual program regulations.
