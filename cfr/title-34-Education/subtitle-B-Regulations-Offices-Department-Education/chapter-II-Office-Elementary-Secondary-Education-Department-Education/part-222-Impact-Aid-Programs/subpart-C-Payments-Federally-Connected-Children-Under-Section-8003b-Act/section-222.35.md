##### ยง 222.35 How does a local educational agency count the membership of its federally connected children? #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 64741, September 20, 2016.

An applicant counts the membership of its federally connected children by using one or both of the following methods:

(a) *Parent-pupil survey.* An applicant may conduct a parent-pupil survey to count the membership of its federally connected children, which must be counted as of the survey date.

(1) The applicant shall conduct a parent-pupil survey by providing a form to a parent of each pupil enrolled in the LEA to substantiate the pupil's place of residence and the parent's place of employment. A parent-pupil survey form must include the following:

(i) Pupil enrollment information (this information may also be obtained from school records), including -

(A) Name of pupil;

(B) Date of birth of the pupil; and

(C) Name of public school and grade of the pupil.

(ii) Pupil residence and parent employment information, including -

(A) Address of the pupil's residence (or other location information for that residence, such as legal description), including the name of the Federal facility if the pupil's residence is on Federal property; and

(B) Name (as it appears on the employer's payroll record) of the parent (mother, father, legal guardian or other person standing in *loco parentis*) who is employed on Federal property and with whom the pupil resides (unless the parent is a member of the uniformed services on active duty);

(C) Name and address of the Federal property on which the parent is employed (or other location information, such as legal description), unless the parent is a member of the uniformed services on active duty;

(D) If the parent is a member of the uniformed services on active duty, the name, rank, and branch of service of that parent;

(E) If the parent is a civilian employed on a Federal vessel, the name of the vessel, hull number, and name of the controlling agency;

(F) The signature of the parent supplying the information and the date of such signature; and

(G) The name of the parent's employer and the employer's address (or other location information, such as legal description), unless a parent is a member of the uniformed services on active duty.

(2) An LEA may accept an unsigned parent-pupil survey form, or a parent-pupil survey form that is signed by a person other than a parent, only under unusual circumstances. In those instances, the parent-pupil survey form must show why the parent did not sign the survey form, and when, how, and from whom the residence and employment information was obtained.

(b) *Source check.* (1) An applicant may count the membership of its federally connected children by using a source check to substantiate a pupil's place of residence or parent's place of employment on the survey date.

(2) A source check is a form provided -

(i) To a parent's employer, on which the employer certifies as to the place of employment of a parent of a pupil claimed;

(ii) To a housing official, on which the official certifies as to the residence of each pupil claimed; or

(iii) To a tribal official, on which the official certifies as to the residence of each pupil claimed residing on Indian lands over which that tribal official has jurisdiction.
