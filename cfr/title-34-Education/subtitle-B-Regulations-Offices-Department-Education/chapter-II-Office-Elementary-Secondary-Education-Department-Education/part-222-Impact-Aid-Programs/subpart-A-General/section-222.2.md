(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 7703 and 8801(1))

*Parent employed on Federal property.* (1) The term means:

(i) An employee of the Federal government who reports to work on, or whose place of work is located on, Federal property, including a Federal employee who reports to an alternative duty station on the survey date, but whose regular duty station is on Federal property.

Example 1:Lauren, a Virginia resident, is an employee of the U.S. Department of Defense. Her physical duty station is in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and her children attend LEA A in Virginia. Lauren meets the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property” as she is both a Federal employee and her duty station is on eligible Federal property in the same State as LEA A. Thus LEA A may claim Lauren's children on its Impact Aid application.Example 2:Alex, a Virginia resident, is an employee of the U.S. Department of Defense. His physical duty station is in the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and his children attend LEA B in Virginia. On the survey date, Alex was teleworking from his home. For purposes of LEA B's Impact Aid application, Alex meets the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property,” as he is both a Federal employee and his duty station is on eligible Federal property in the same State as LEA B, even though Alex was at an alternative duty station on the survey date because he teleworked. LEA B may claim Alex's children on its Impact Aid application.Example 3:Elroy is an employee of the U.S. Department of Education. His normal duty station is on eligible Federal property located in Washington, DC. Elroy's place of residence is in Virginia, and his children attend LEA C in Virginia. Elroy, a Federal employee, does not meet the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property.” The statute requires that the Federal property on which a parent is employed be in the same State as the LEA (ESEA section 7003(a)(1)(G)), and because the Federal property where Elroy works is not in the same State as LEA C, LEA C may not claim Elroy's children.

(ii) A person not employed by the Federal government but who spends more than 50 percent of his or her working time on Federal property (whether as an employee or self-employed) when engaged in farming, grazing, lumbering, mining, or other operations that are authorized by the Federal government, through a lease or other arrangement, to be carried out entirely or partly on Federal property.

Example 1:Xavier, a dealer at a casino on eligible Indian lands in Utah, reports to work at the casino as his normal duty station and works his eight hour shift at the casino. Xavier's child attends school in LEA D in Utah. For purposes of Impact Aid, Xavier meets the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property” because, although Xavier is not a Federal employee, his duty station is the casino, which is located on an eligible Federal property within the same State as LEA D. LEA D may claim Xavier's children on its Impact Aid application.Example 2:Becca works at a privately owned convenience store on leased property on a military installation in Maine. Becca's children attend school at a LEA E, a Maine public school district. On a daily basis, including on the survey date, Becca reports to work at the convenience store where she works her entire shift. Becca meets the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property” for LEA E because, although Becca is not a Federal employee, her duty station is the convenience store, which is located on an eligible Federal property within the same State as LEA E. LEA E may claim Becca's children on its Impact Aid application.Example 3:Zoe leases Federal property in Massachusetts to grow lima beans. Zoe's daughter attends LEA F, a Massachusetts public school. On the survey date, Zoe has a valid lease agreement to carry out farming operations that are authorized by the Federal government. Zoe also has a crop of corn on an adjacent field that is not on Federal property. On the survey date, Zoe spent 75 percent of her day harvesting lima beans and 25 percent of her day harvesting corn. Because Zoe spent more than 50 percent of her day working on farming operations that are authorized by the Federal government on leased Federal property in the same State her daughter attends school, Zoe meets the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property,” and LEA F can claim her daughter on its Impact Aid application.Example 4:Frank is a private contractor with an office on a military installation and an office on private property, both of which are located in Maryland. His time is split between the two offices. Frank's children attend public school in Maryland in LEA G. On the survey date, Frank reported to his office on the military installation. He spent 4 of his 8 hours at the office on the military installation and 4 hours at the privately owned office facility. Frank's children attend LEA G, a Maryland public school. Frank meets the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property” because he reported to work on the military installation and he spent at least 50 percent of his time on Federal property conducting operations that are authorized by the Federal government on eligible Federal property in the same State as LEA G. LEA G may claim Frank's children on its Impact Aid application.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition, the term does not include a person who is not employed by the Federal government and reports to work at a location not on Federal property, even though the individual provides services to operations or activities authorized to be carried out on Federal property.

Example 1:Maria delivers bread to the convenience store and the commissary, which are both eligible Federal properties located on a military installation in Florida. Maria's son attends school in LEA H, a Florida public school district. On a daily basis, including the survey date, Maria reports to a privately owned warehouse on private property to get her inventory for delivery. Maria is not a Federal employee and her duty station is the warehouse located on private property. She therefore does not meet the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property” for purposes of Impact Aid. LEA H may not claim Maria's children on its Impact Aid application.Example 2:Lorenzo is a construction worker who is working on an eligible Federal property in Arizona, but each day he reports to his construction office located on private property to get his daily assignments and meet with the crew before going to the jobsite. Lorenzo's twins attend LEA I, in Arizona. Lorenzo is not a Federal employee and his duty station is the construction office and not the Federal property. Lorenzo therefore does not meet the definition of a “parent employed on Federal property.” LEA I may not claim Lorenzo's children on its Impact Aid application.Example 3:Aubrey, a defense contractor, routinely reports to work at her duty station on private property in California. Aubrey's children attend LEA J in California. On the survey date, Aubrey attends an all-day meeting on a military installation. Aubrey is not a Federal employee and she does not normally report to work on eligible Federal property; as a result, Aubrey is not an eligible parent employed on Federal property, and LEA J cannot claim her children on its Impact Aid application.(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 7703)
