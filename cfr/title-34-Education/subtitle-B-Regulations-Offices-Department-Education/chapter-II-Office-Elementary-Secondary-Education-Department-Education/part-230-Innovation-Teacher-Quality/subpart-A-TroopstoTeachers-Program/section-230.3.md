(i) Those who agree to obtain certification to teach science, mathematics, or special education and who agree to teach in a “high-need school” as defined in section 2304(d)(3) of the Act.

(ii) Those who agree to obtain certification to teach another subject or subjects and who agree to teach in a “high-need school” as defined in section 2304(d)(3) of the Act.

(iii) Those who agree to obtain certification to teach science, mathematics, or special education or obtain certification to teach at the elementary school level.
