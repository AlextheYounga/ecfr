##### ยง 299.2 What general administrative regulations apply to ESEA programs? #####

Title 2 of the CFR, part 200, as adopted at 2 CFR part 3474, applies to the ESEA programs except for title VIII programs (Impact Aid) (in addition to any other specific implementing regulations) as follows:

(a) 2 CFR part 200 applies to grantees under direct grant programs (as defined in 34 CFR 75.1(b)).

(b) 2 CFR part 200 also applies to grantees under all other programs under the ESEA unless a State formally adopts its own written fiscal and administrative requirements for expending and accounting for all funds received by State educational agencies (SEAs) and local educational agencies (LEAs) under the ESEA. If a State adopts its own alternative requirements, the requirements must be available for inspection upon the request of the Secretary or the Secretary's representatives and must -

(1) Be sufficiently specific to ensure that funds received under ESEA and title III of Goals 2000 are used in compliance with all applicable statutory and regulatory provisions;

(2) Ensure that funds received for programs under ESEA and title III of Goals 2000 are spent only for reasonable and necessary costs of operating those programs; and

(3) Ensure that funds received under ESEA and title III of Goals 2000 are not used for general expenses required to carry out other responsibilities of State or local governments.

Note:

34 CFR 222.13 indicates which EDGAR provisions apply to title VIII programs (Impact Aid).

Note:

To meet the first of the three standards, alternative State provisions must, among other things, ensure that costs are allocable to a particular cost objective.
