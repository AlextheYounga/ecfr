##### ยง 226.13 What statutory funding priority does the Secretary use in making a grant award? #####

The Secretary shall award additional points under a competitive preference priority regarding:

(a) *Periodic Review and Evaluation.* The State provides for periodic review and evaluation by the authorized public chartering agency of each charter school at least once every five years unless required more frequently by State law, to determine whether the charter school is meeting the terms of the school's charter and is meeting or exceeding the student academic performance requirements and goals for charter schools as set forth under State law or the school's charter.

(b) *Number of High-Quality Charter Schools.* The State has demonstrated progress in increasing the number of high-quality charter schools that are held accountable in the terms of the schools' charters for meeting clear and measurable objectives for the educational progress of the students attending the schools, in the period prior to the period for which the State applies for a grant under this competition.

(c) *One Authorized Public Chartering Agency Other than an LEA, or an Appeals Process.* The State -

(1) Provides for one authorized public chartering agency that is not a local educational agency (LEA), such as a State chartering board, for each individual or entity seeking to operate a charter school pursuant to State law; or

(2) In the case of a State in which LEAs are the only authorized public chartering agencies, allows for an appeals process for the denial of an application for a charter school.

(d) *High Degree of Autonomy.* The State ensures that each charter school has a high degree of autonomy over the charter school's budgets and expenditures.
