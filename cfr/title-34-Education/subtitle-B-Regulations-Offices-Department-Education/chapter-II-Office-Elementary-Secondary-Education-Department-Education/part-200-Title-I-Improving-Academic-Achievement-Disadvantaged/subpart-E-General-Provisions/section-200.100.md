(i) Two percent from the sum of the amounts allocated to the State under section 1002(a) of the ESEA for fiscal years 2002 and 2003; and

(ii) Four percent from the sum of the amounts allocated to the State under section 1002(a) of the ESEA for fiscal year 2004 and succeeding years.

(2) In reserving funds under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a State may not reduce the sum of the allocations an LEA receives under section 1002(a) of the ESEA below the sum of the allocations the LEA received under section 1002(a) for the preceding fiscal year.

(3) If funds under section 1002(a) are insufficient in a given fiscal year to implement both paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, a State is not required to reserve the full amount required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(b) *State administration.* (1) An SEA may reserve for State administrative activities authorized in sections 1004 and 1903 of the ESEA no more than the greater of -

(ii) If an SEA reserves funds from the amounts allocated to the State or Outlying Area under section 1002(c) or (d) of the ESEA, the SEA may not reserve from those allocations more than the amount the SEA would have reserved if it had reserved proportionate amounts from section 1002(a), (c), and (d) of the ESEA.

(d) *Reservations and hold-harmless.* In reserving funds under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, an SEA may -

(2) Proportionately reduce each LEA's total allocation received under section 1002(a) of the ESEA even if an LEA's total allocation falls below its hold-harmless percentage under ยง 200.74(a)(3).
