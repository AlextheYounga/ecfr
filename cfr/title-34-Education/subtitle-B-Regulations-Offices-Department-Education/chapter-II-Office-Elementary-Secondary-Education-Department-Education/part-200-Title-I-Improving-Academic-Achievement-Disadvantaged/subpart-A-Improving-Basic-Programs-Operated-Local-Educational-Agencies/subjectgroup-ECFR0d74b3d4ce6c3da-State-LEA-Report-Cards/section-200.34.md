##### § 200.34 High school graduation rate. #####

(a) *Four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.* A State must calculate a four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate for each public high school in the State in the following manner:

(1) The numerator must consist of the sum of -

(i) All students who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma; and

(ii) All students with the most significant cognitive disabilities in the cohort, assessed using an alternate assessment aligned to alternate academic achievement standards under section 1111(b)(2)(D) of the Act and awarded a State-defined alternate diploma.

(2) The denominator must consist of the number of students who form the adjusted cohort of entering first-time students in grade 9 enrolled in the high school no later than the date by which student membership data is collected annually by the State for submission to the National Center for Education Statistics.

(3) For those high schools that start after grade 9, the cohort must be calculated based on the earliest high school grade students attend.

(b) *Adjusting the cohort.* (1) “Adjusted cohort” means the students who enter grade 9 (or the earliest high school grade) plus any students who transfer into the cohort in grades 9 through 12, and minus any students removed from the cohort.

(2) “Students who transfer into the cohort” means the students who enroll after the beginning of the date of the determination of the cohort, up to and including in grade 12.

(3) To remove a student from the cohort, a school or LEA must confirm in writing that the student -

(i) Transferred out, such that the school or LEA has official written documentation that the student enrolled in another school or educational program from which the student is expected to receive a regular high school diploma, or a State-defined alternate diploma for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities;

(ii) Emigrated to another country;

(iii) Transferred to a prison or juvenile facility after an adjudication of delinquency, and is enrolled in an educational program from which the student is expected to receive a regular high school diploma, or a State-defined alternate diploma for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, during the period in which the student is assigned to the prison or juvenile facility; or

(iv) Is deceased.

(4) A student who is retained in grade, enrolls in a general equivalency diploma program or other alternative education program that does not issue or provide credit toward the issuance of a regular high school diploma or a State-defined alternate diploma, or leaves school for any reason other than those described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section may not be counted as having transferred out for the purpose of calculating the graduation rate and must remain in the adjusted cohort.

(5) For students with the most significant cognitive disabilities assessed using an alternate assessment aligned to alternate academic achievement standards under section 1111(b)(2)(D) of the Act and who are eligible for a State-defined alternate diploma under § 200.34(c)(3), an LEA or school must -

(i) Assign the student to the cohort of entering first-time students in grade 9 and ensure that the student remains in that cohort through grade 12.

(ii) Remove such a student from the original cohort if the student does not graduate after four years but continues to be enrolled in the school or LEA and is expected to receive a State-defined alternate diploma that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section;

(iii) Reassign such a student who graduates with a State-defined alternate diploma after more than four years to the cohort of students graduating in that year and include the student in the numerator and denominator of the graduation rate calculation -

(A) For the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate for the year in which the student graduates; and

(B) For an extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate under paragraph (d) of this section for one or more subsequent years, if the State has adopted such a rate.

(iv) Reassign such a student who after more than four years does not graduate with a State-defined alternate diploma that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section to the cohort of students graduating in the year in which the student exits high school and include the student in the denominator of the graduation rate calculation -

(A) For the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate for the year in which the student exits high school; and

(B) For an extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate under paragraph (d) of this section for one or more subsequent years, if the State has adopted such a rate.

(c) *Definition of terms.* For the purposes of calculating an adjusted cohort graduation rate under this section -

(1) “Students who graduate in four years” means students who earn a regular high school diploma before, during, or at the conclusion of their fourth year, or during a summer session immediately following their fourth year.

(2) “Regular high school diploma” means the standard high school diploma awarded to the preponderance of students in the State that is fully aligned with State standards, or a higher diploma. A regular high school diploma does not include -

(i) A diploma aligned to the alternate academic achievement standards described in section 1111(b)(1)(E) of the ESEA, as amended by the ESSA; or

(ii) A general equivalency diploma, certificate of completion, certificate of attendance, or any similar or lesser credential, such as a diploma based on meeting individualized education program (IEP) goals.

(3) “Alternate diploma” means a diploma for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, as defined by the State, who are assessed with a State's alternate assessments aligned to alternate academic achievement standards under section 1111(b)(2)(D) of the Act and is -

(i) Standards-based;

(ii) Aligned with the State's requirements for a regular high school diploma; and

(iii) Obtained within the time period for which the State ensures the availability of a free appropriate public education under section 612(a)(1) of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(1)).

(d) *Extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.* In addition to calculating a four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, a State may calculate and report an extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.

(1) *“Extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate”* means the number of students who graduate in four years, plus the number of students who graduate in one or more additional years beyond the fourth year of high school with a regular high school diploma or a State-defined alternate diploma, divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, provided that the adjustments account for any students who transfer into the cohort by the end of the year of graduation being considered minus the number of students who transfer out, emigrate to another country, transfer to a prison or juvenile facility, or are deceased, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(2) A State may calculate one or more extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rates.

(e) *Reporting on State and LEA report cards.* (1) A State and LEA report card must include, at the school, LEA, and State levels -

(i) Four-year adjusted cohort graduation rates and, if adopted by the State, extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rates for all students and disaggregated by each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2), homeless status, and status as a child in foster care.

(ii) Whether all students and each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2) met or did not meet the State measurements of interim progress for graduation rates under § 200.13(b); and

(2) In reporting graduation rates disaggregated by each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2), homeless status, and status as a child in foster care, a State and its LEAs must include students who were children with disabilities, English learners, children who are homeless (as defined in § 200.30(f)(1)(ii)), or children who are in foster care (as defined in § 200.30(f)(1)(iii)) at any time during the cohort period.

(3) A State and its LEAs must report the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate and, if adopted by the State, extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate that reflects results of the immediately preceding school year.

(4) If a State adopts an extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate, the State and its LEAs must report the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate separately from the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.

(f) *Partial school enrollment.* Each State must apply the same approach in all LEAs to determine whether students who are enrolled in the same school for less than half of the academic year as described in § 200.20(b) who exit high school without a regular high school diploma and do not transfer into another high school that grants a regular high school diploma are counted in the denominator for reporting the adjusted cohort graduation rate -

(1) At the school in which such student was enrolled for the greatest proportion of school days while enrolled in grades 9 through 12; or

(2) At the school in which the student was most recently enrolled.
