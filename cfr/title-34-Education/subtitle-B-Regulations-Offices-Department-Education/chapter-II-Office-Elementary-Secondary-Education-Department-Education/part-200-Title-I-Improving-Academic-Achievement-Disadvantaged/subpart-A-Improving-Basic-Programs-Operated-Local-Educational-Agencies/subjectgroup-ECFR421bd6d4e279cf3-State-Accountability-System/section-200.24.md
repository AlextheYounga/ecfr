(2) In awarding school improvement funds under this section, a State must -

(i) Award the funds on a competitive or formula basis;

(ii) Make each award of sufficient size, with a minimum award of $500,000 per year for each school identified for comprehensive support and improvement to be served and a minimum award of $50,000 per year for each school identified for targeted support and improvement to be served, to support the LEA to effectively implement all requirements for a support and improvement plan under § 200.21 or § 200.22, as applicable, including selected evidence-based interventions, except that a State may determine that an award of less than the minimum award amount is appropriate if, based on each school's enrollment, identified needs, selected evidence-based interventions, and other relevant factors described in the LEA's application on behalf of the school, that such lesser amount will be sufficient to support effective implementation of such plan; and

(iii) Make awards not to exceed four years, which may include a planning year consistent with paragraph (b)(9) of this section during which the LEA must plan to carry out activities that will be supported with school improvement funds by, at the latest, the beginning of the school year following the school year for which the school was identified, and that will support the successful implementation of interventions required under §§ 200.21 or 200.22, as applicable.
