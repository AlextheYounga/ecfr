##### § 200.17 Disaggregation of data. #####

(a) *Statistically sound and reliable information.* (1) Based on sound statistical methodology, each State must determine the minimum number of students sufficient to -

(i) Yield statistically reliable information for each purpose for which disaggregated data are used, including purposes of reporting information under section 1111(h) of the Act or purposes of the statewide accountability system under section 1111(c) of the Act; and

(ii) Ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2) is included at the school level for annual meaningful differentiation and identification of schools under §§ 200.18 and 200.19.

(2) Such number -

(i) Must be the same number for all students and for each subgroup of students in the State described in § 200.16(a)(2);

(ii) Must be the same number for all purposes of the statewide accountability system under section 1111(c) of the Act, including measuring school performance for each indicator under § 200.14;

(iii) Must not exceed 30 students, unless the State provides a justification for doing so in its State plan under section 1111 of the Act consistent with paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section; and

(iv) May be a lower number for purposes of reporting under section 1111(h) under the Act than for purposes of the statewide accountability system under section 1111(c) of the Act so long as such number for reporting meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

(3) A State must include in its State plan under section 1111 of the Act -

(i) A description of how the State's minimum number of students meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section;

(ii) An explanation of how other components of the statewide accountability system, such as the State's uniform procedure for averaging data under § 200.20(a), interact with the State's minimum number of students to affect the statistical reliability and soundness of accountability data and to ensure the maximum inclusion of all students and each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2);

(iii) A description of the strategies the State uses to protect the privacy of individual students for each purpose for which disaggregated data is required, including reporting under section 1111(h) of the Act and the statewide accountability system under section 1111(c) of the Act, as required in paragraph (b) of this section;

(iv) Information regarding the number and percentage of all students and students in each subgroup described in § 200.16(a)(2) for whose results schools would not be held accountable in the system of annual meaningful differentiation under § 200.18; and

(v) For a State proposing a minimum number of students exceeding 30, a justification that explains how a minimum number of students exceeding 30 promotes sound, reliable accountability determinations, including data on the number and percentage of schools in the State that would not be held accountable in the system of annual meaningful differentiation under § 200.18 for the results of students in each subgroup described in § 200.16(a)(2) under the minimum number proposed by the State compared to the data on the number and percentage of schools in the State that would not be held accountable for the results of students in each subgroup if the minimum number of students were 30.

(b) *Personally identifiable information.* (1) A State may not use disaggregated data for one or more subgroups described in § 200.16(a) to report required information under section 1111(h) of the Act if the results would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student, teacher, principal, or other school leader.

(2) To determine whether the collection and dissemination of disaggregated information would reveal personally identifiable information about an individual student, teacher, principal, or other school leader, a State must apply the requirements under section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act (the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974).

(3) Nothing in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section may be construed to abrogate the responsibility of a State to implement the requirements of section 1111(c) of the Act to annually meaningfully differentiate among all public schools in the State on the basis of the performance of all students and each subgroup of students described in section 1111(c)(2) of the Act on all indicators under section 1111(c)(4)(B) of the Act.

(4) Each State and LEA must implement appropriate strategies to protect the privacy of individual students in reporting information under section 1111(h) of the Act and in establishing annual meaningful differentiation of schools in its statewide accountability system under section 1111(c) of the Act on the basis of disaggregated subgroup information.

(c) *Inclusion of subgroups in assessments.* If a subgroup described in § 200.16(a) is not of sufficient size to produce statistically sound and reliable results, a State must still include students in that subgroup in its State assessments under section 1111(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act.

(d) *Disaggregation at the LEA and State.* If the number of students in a subgroup is not statistically sound and reliable at the school level, a State must include those students in disaggregated information at each level for which the number of students is statistically sound and reliable (*e.g.,* the LEA or State level).
