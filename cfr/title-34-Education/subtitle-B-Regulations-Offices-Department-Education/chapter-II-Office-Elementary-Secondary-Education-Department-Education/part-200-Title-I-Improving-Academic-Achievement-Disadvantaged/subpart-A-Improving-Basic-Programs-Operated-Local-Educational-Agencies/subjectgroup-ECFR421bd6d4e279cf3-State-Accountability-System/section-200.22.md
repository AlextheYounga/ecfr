(1) Notify as soon as possible, but no later than the beginning of the school year for which such school is identified, each LEA serving such school of the identification; and

(2) Ensure such LEA provides notification to each school identified for targeted support and improvement, including the reason for identification (*i.e.,* the subgroup or subgroups described in § 200.16(a)(2) that are identified as consistently underperforming under § 200.19(b)(1), the subgroup or subgroups that are low-performing under § 200.19(b)(2) and will receive additional targeted support, and, at the State's discretion, the subgroup or subgroups that are identified under § 200.15(b)(2)(iii)), no later than the beginning of the school year for which such school is identified.

(b) *Notice.* (1) Upon receiving the notification from the State under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the LEA must promptly notify the parents of each student enrolled in the school of the school's identification for targeted support and improvement, consistent with the requirements under § 200.21(b)(1) through (3).

(2) The notice must include -

(i) The reason or reasons for the identification (*i.e.,* which subgroup or subgroups are consistently underperforming under § 200.19(b)(1), which subgroup or subgroups are low-performing under § 200.19(b)(2) and will receive additional targeted support, and any subgroup or subgroups identified under § 200.15(b)(2)(iii) if the State chooses to require such schools to implement targeted support and improvement plans); and

(ii) An explanation of how parents can become involved in developing and implementing the targeted support and improvement plan described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) *Targeted support and improvement plan.* Upon receiving the notification from the LEA under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, each school must develop and implement a school-level targeted support and improvement plan to address the reason or reasons for identification and improve student outcomes for the lowest-performing students in the school that -

(1) Is developed in partnership with stakeholders (including principals and other school leaders; teachers; and parents and, as appropriate, students) as demonstrated by, at a minimum, describing in the plan how -

(i) Early stakeholder input was solicited and taken into account in the development of each component of the plan, including any changes made as a result of such input; and

(ii) Stakeholders will have an opportunity to participate in an ongoing manner in such plan's implementation;

(iii) Are supported, to the extent practicable, by the strongest level of evidence that is available and appropriate to improve student outcomes for the lowest-performing students in the school; and

(iv) May be selected from a non-exhaustive list of evidence-based interventions if such a list is established by the State, and must be selected from an exhaustive list of evidence-based interventions if such a list is established by the State, consistent with § 200.23(c)(2);

(5) Must be fully implemented in the school year for which such school is identified, except that a school identified under § 200.19(b) may have a planning year during which the school must develop the targeted support and improvement plan and complete other activities necessary to prepare for successful implementation of interventions required under the plan during the planning year or, at the latest, the first full day of the school year following the school year for which the school was identified;

(6) Is submitted to the LEA for approval, pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section;

(7) In the case of a school with low-performing subgroups as described in § 200.19(b)(2), and to ensure such school receives additional targeted support as required under section 1111(d)(2)(C) of the Act, identifies and addresses resource inequities by -

(i) Including a review of LEA- and school-level resources among schools and, as applicable, within schools with respect to -

(8) For any school operating a schoolwide program under section 1114 of the Act, addresses the needs identified by the needs assessment required under section 1114(b)(6) of the Act.

(d) *Plan approval and monitoring.* The LEA must, upon receipt of a targeted support and improvement plan under paragraph (c) of this section from a school -

(1) Review each plan against the requirements of this section and approve such plan in a timely manner, taking all actions necessary to ensure that each school is able to meet all of the requirements under paragraph (c) of this section within the required timeframe;

(2) Make the approved plan, and any amendments to the plan, publicly available, including to parents consistent with the requirements under § 200.21(b)(1) through (3); and

(3) Monitor the school's implementation of the plan.

(e) *Exit criteria.* Except with respect to schools described in paragraph (f) of this section, the LEA must establish and make publicly available, including to parents consistent with the requirements under § 200.21(b)(1) through (3), uniform exit criteria for schools identified by the State under § 200.19(b) and, as applicable, § 200.15(b)(2)(iii), and use such criteria to make one of the following determinations with respect to each such school after a number of years as determined by the LEA:

(1) The school has successfully implemented its targeted support and improvement plan such that it no longer meets the criteria for identification and has improved student outcomes for its lowest-performing students, including each subgroup of students that was identified as consistently underperforming under § 200.19(b)(1) or low-performing under § 200.19(b)(2), or, in the case of a school implementing a targeted support and improvement plan consistent with § 200.15(b)(2)(iii), has met the requirement under § 200.15(a)(2) for student participation in the assessments required under section 1111(b)(2)(B)(v)(I) of the Act, and will exit targeted support and improvement status.

(2) The school has unsuccessfully implemented its targeted support and improvement plan such that it has not improved student outcomes for its lowest-performing students, including each subgroup of students that was identified as consistently underperforming under § 200.19(b)(1) or low-performing under § 200.19(b)(2), or, in the case of a school implementing a targeted support and improvement plan consistent with § 200.15(b)(2)(iii), has failed to meet the requirement under § 200.15(a)(2) for student participation in the assessments required under section 1111(b)(2)(B)(v)(I) of the Act, in which case the LEA must subsequently -

(i) Require the school to amend its targeted support and improvement plan to include additional actions that continue to meet all requirements under paragraph (c) of this section and address the reasons the school did not meet the exit criteria, and encourage interventions that either meet a higher level of evidence under paragraph (c)(4) of this section than the interventions included in the school's original plan or increase the intensity of effective interventions in the school's original plan;

(ii) Review and approve the school's amended plan consistent with the review process required under paragraph (d)(1) of this section; and

(iii) Increase its monitoring and support of such school's implementation of the plan.

(f) *Special rule for schools with low-performing subgroups.* (1) With respect to any school participating under subpart A of this part that has one or more low-performing subgroups as described in § 200.19(b)(2), the State must establish, make publicly available, and describe in its State plan under section 1111 of the Act, uniform statewide exit criteria that, at a minimum, ensure each such school -

(i) Improves student outcomes for its lowest-performing students, including each subgroup of students identified as low-performing under § 200.19(b)(2); and

(ii) No longer meets the criteria for identification under § 200.19(b)(2).

(2) If a school does not satisfy the exit criteria established under paragraph (f)(1) of this section within a State-determined timeline, the State must identify the school for comprehensive support and improvement under § 200.19(a)(3), consistent with § 200.19(d)(1)(i).
