##### § 200.13 Long-term goals and measurements of interim progress. #####

In designing its statewide accountability system under § 200.12, each State must establish long-term goals and measurements of interim progress that use the same multi-year timeline to achieve those goals for all students and for each subgroup of students, except that goals for Progress in Achieving English language proficiency must only be established for the English learner subgroup. The long-term goals and measurements of interim progress must include, at a minimum, each of the following:

(a) *Academic achievement.* (1) Each State must, in its State plan under section 1111 of the Act -

(i) Identify its ambitious State-designed long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for improved academic achievement, as measured by the percentage of students attaining grade-level proficiency on the annual assessments required under section 1111(b)(2)(B)(v)(I) of the Act, for all students and separately for each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2); and

(ii) Describe how it established those goals and measurements of interim progress.

(2) In establishing the long-term goals and measurements of interim progress under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a State must -

(i) Apply the same academic achievement standards consistent with section 1111(b)(1) of the Act to all public school students in the State, except as provided for students with the most significant cognitive disabilities, whose performance under subpart A of this part may be assessed against alternate academic achievement standards defined by the State consistent with section 1111(b)(1)(E) of the Act;

(ii) Measure achievement separately for reading/language arts and for mathematics; and

(iii) Take into account the improvement necessary for each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2) to make significant progress in closing statewide proficiency gaps, such that the State's measurements of interim progress require greater rates of improvement for subgroups of students that are lower-achieving.

(b) *Graduation rates.* (1) Each State must, in its State plan under section 1111 of the Act -

(i) Identify its ambitious State-designed long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for improved graduation rates for all students and separately for each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2); and

(ii) Describe how it established those goals and measurements of interim progress.

(2) A State's long-term goals and measurements of interim progress under paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be based on -

(i) The four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate consistent with § 200.34(a); and

(ii) If a State chooses to use an extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate as part of its Graduation Rate indicator under § 200.14(b)(3), the extended-year adjusted cohort graduation rate consistent with § 200.34(d), except that a State must set more rigorous long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for each such graduation rate, as compared to the long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for the four-year adjusted cohort graduation rate.

(3) In establishing the long-term goals and measurements of interim progress under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, a State must take into account the improvement necessary for each subgroup of students described in § 200.16(a)(2) to make significant progress in closing statewide graduation rate gaps, such that a State's measurements of interim progress require greater rates of improvement for subgroups that graduate high school at lower rates.

(c) *English language proficiency.* (1) Each State must, in its State plan under section 1111 of the Act -

(i) Identify its ambitious State-designed long-term goals and measurements of interim progress for increases in the percentage of all English learners in the State making annual progress toward attaining English language proficiency, as measured by the English language proficiency assessment required in section 1111(b)(2)(G) of the Act; and

(ii) Describe how it established those goals and measurements of interim progress.

(2) Each State must describe in its State plan under section 1111 of the Act a uniform procedure, applied to all English learners in the State in a consistent manner, to establish research-based student-level targets on which the goals and measurements of interim progress under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are based. The State-developed uniform procedure must -

(i) Take into consideration, at the time of a student's identification as an English learner, the student's English language proficiency level, and may take into consideration, at a State's discretion, one or more of the following student characteristics:

(A) Time in language instruction educational programs.

(B) Grade level.

(C) Age.

(D) Native language proficiency level.

(E) Limited or interrupted formal education, if any;

(ii) Based on the selected student characteristics under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, determine the applicable timeline, up to a State-determined maximum number of years, for English learners sharing particular characteristics under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section to attain English language proficiency after a student's identification as an English learner; and

(iii) Establish student-level targets, based on the applicable timelines under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, that set the expectation for all English learners to make annual progress toward attaining English language proficiency within the applicable timelines for such students.

(3) The description under paragraph (c)(2) of this section must include a rationale for how the State determined the overall maximum number of years for English learners to attain English language proficiency in its uniform procedure for setting research-based student-level targets, and the applicable timelines over which English learners sharing particular characteristics under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section would be expected to attain English language proficiency within such State-determined maximum number of years.

(4) An English learner who does not attain English language proficiency within the timeline under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section must not be exited from English learner services or status prior to attaining English language proficiency.
