##### § 200.30 Local review. #####

(a) Each LEA receiving funds under subpart A of this part must use the results of the State assessment system described in § 200.2 to review annually the progress of each school served under subpart A of this part to determine whether the school is making AYP in accordance with § 200.20.

(b)(1) In reviewing the progress of an elementary or secondary school operating a targeted assistance program, an LEA may choose to review the progress of only the students in the school who are served, or are eligible for services, under subpart A of this part.

(2) The LEA may exercise the option under paragraph (b)(1) of this section so long as the students selected for services under the targeted assistance program are those with the greatest need for special assistance, consistent with the requirements of section 1115 of the ESEA.

(2)(i) The LEA may use these assessments and indicators -

(A) To identify additional schools for school improvement or in need of corrective action or restructuring; and

(B) To permit a school to make AYP if, in accordance with § 200.20(b), the school also reduces the percentage of a student group not meeting the State's proficient level of academic achievement by at least 10 percent.

(ii) The LEA may not, with the exception described in paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B) of this section, use these assessments and indicators to reduce the number of, or change the identity of, the schools that would otherwise be identified for school improvement, corrective action, or restructuring if the LEA did not use these additional indicators.

(d) The LEA must publicize and disseminate the results of its annual progress review to parents, teachers, principals, schools, and the community.

(e) The LEA must review the effectiveness of actions and activities that schools are carrying out under subpart A of this part with respect to parental involvement, professional development, and other activities assisted under subpart A of this part.
