##### § 200.32 Identification for school improvement. #####

(a)(1)(i) An LEA must identify for school improvement any elementary or secondary school served under subpart A of this part that fails, for two consecutive years, to make AYP as defined under §§ 200.13 through 200.20.

(ii) In identifying schools for improvement, an LEA -

(A) May base identification on whether a school did not make AYP because it did not meet the annual measurable objectives for the same subject or meet the same other academic indicator for two consecutive years; but

(B) May not limit identification to those schools that did not make AYP only because they did not meet the annual measurable objectives for the same subject or meet the same other academic indicator for the same subgroup under § 200.13(b)(7)(ii) for two consecutive years.

(2) The LEA must make the identification described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section before the beginning of the school year following the year in which the LEA administered the assessments that resulted in the school's failure to make AYP for a second consecutive year.

(b)(1) An LEA must treat any school that was in the first year of school improvement status on January 7, 2002 as a school that is in the first year of school improvement under § 200.39 for the 2002-2003 school year.

(2) Not later than the first day of the 2002-2003 school year, the LEA must, in accordance with § 200.44, provide public school choice to all students in the school.

(c)(1) An LEA must treat any school that was identified for school improvement for two or more consecutive years on January 7, 2002 as a school that is in its second year of school improvement under § 200.39 for the 2002-2003 school year.

(2) Not later than the first day of the 2002-2003 school year, the LEA must -

(i) In accordance with § 200.44, provide public school choice to all students in the school; and

(ii) In accordance with § 200.45, make available supplemental educational services to eligible students who remain in the school.

(d) An LEA may remove from improvement status a school otherwise subject to the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section if, on the basis of assessments the LEA administers during the 2001-2002 school year, the school makes AYP for a second consecutive year.

(e)(1) An LEA may, but is not required to, identify a school for improvement if, on the basis of assessments the LEA administers during the 2001-2002 school year, the school fails to make AYP for a second consecutive year.

(2) An LEA that does not identify such a school for improvement, however, must count the 2001-2002 school year as the first year of not making AYP for the purpose of subsequent identification decisions under paragraph (a) of this section.

(f) If an LEA identifies a school for improvement after the beginning of the school year following the year in which the LEA administered the assessments that resulted in the school's failure to make AYP for a second consecutive year -

(1) The school is subject to the requirements of school improvement under § 200.39 immediately upon identification, including the provision of public school choice; and

(2) The LEA must count that school year as a full school year for the purposes of subjecting the school to additional improvement measures if the school continues to fail to make AYP.
