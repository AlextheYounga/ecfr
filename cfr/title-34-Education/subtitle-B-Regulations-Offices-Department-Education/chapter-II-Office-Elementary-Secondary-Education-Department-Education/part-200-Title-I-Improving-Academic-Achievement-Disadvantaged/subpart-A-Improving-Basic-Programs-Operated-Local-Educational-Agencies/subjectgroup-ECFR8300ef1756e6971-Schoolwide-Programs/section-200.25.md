##### § 200.25 Schoolwide programs in general. #####

(a) *Purpose.* (1) The purpose of a schoolwide program is to improve academic achievement throughout a school so that all students, particularly the lowest-achieving students, demonstrate proficiency related to the State's academic standards under § 200.1.

(2) The improved achievement is to result from improving the entire educational program of the school.

(b) *Eligibility.* (1) A school may operate a schoolwide program if -

(i) The school's LEA determines that the school serves an eligible attendance area or is a participating school under section 1113 of the ESEA; and

(ii) For the initial year of the schoolwide program -

(A) The school serves a school attendance area in which not less than 40 percent of the children are from low-income families; or

(B) Not less than 40 percent of the children enrolled in the school are from low-income families.

(2) In determining the percentage of children from low-income families under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, the LEA may use a measure of poverty that is different from the measure or measures of poverty used by the LEA to identify and rank school attendance areas for eligibility and participation under subpart A of this part.

(c) *Participating students and services.* A school operating a schoolwide program is not required to -

(1) Identify particular children as eligible to participate; or

(2) As required under section 1120A(b) of the ESEA, provide services that supplement, and do not supplant, the services participating children would otherwise receive if they were not participating in a program under subpart A of this part.

(d) Supplemental funds. A school operating a schoolwide program must use funds available under subpart A of this part and under any other Federal program included under paragraph (e) of this section and § 200.29 only to supplement the total amount of funds that would, in the absence of the Federal funds, be made available from non-Federal sources for that school, including funds needed to provide services that are required by law for children with disabilities and children with limited English proficiency.

(e) *Consolidation of funds.* An eligible school may, consistent with § 200.29, consolidate and use funds or services under subpart A of this part, together with other Federal, State, and local funds that the school receives, to operate a schoolwide program in accordance with §§ 200.25 through 200.29.

(f) *Prekindergarten program.* A school operating a schoolwide program may use funds made available under subpart A of this part to establish or enhance prekindergarten programs for children below the age of 6, such as Even Start programs or Early Reading First programs.
