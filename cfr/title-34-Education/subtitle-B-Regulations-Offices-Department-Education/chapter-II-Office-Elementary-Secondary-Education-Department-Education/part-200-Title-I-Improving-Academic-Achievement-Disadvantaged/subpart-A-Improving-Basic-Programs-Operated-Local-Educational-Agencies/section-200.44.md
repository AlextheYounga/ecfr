(6) Except as described in §§ 200.32(d) and 200.33(c), if a school was in school improvement or subject to corrective action before January 8, 2002, the State must ensure that the LEA provides a public school choice option in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section not later than the first day of the 2002-2003 school year.

(b) *Limitation on State law prohibition.* An LEA may invoke the State law prohibition on choice described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section only if the State law prohibits choice through restrictions on public school assignments or the transfer of students from one public school to another public school.

(c) *Desegregation plans.* (1) If an LEA is subject to a desegregation plan, whether that plan is voluntary, court-ordered, or required by a Federal or State administrative agency, the LEA is not exempt from the requirement in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(2) In determining how to provide students with the option to transfer to another school, the LEA may take into account the requirements of the desegregation plan.
