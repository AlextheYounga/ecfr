(a) *Basis for discharge* - (1) *False certification.* The Secretary discharges a borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan in accordance with the provisions of this section if a school falsely certifies the eligibility of the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) to receive the loan. The Secretary considers a student's eligibility to borrow to have been falsely certified by the school if the school -

(i) Certified the student's eligibility for a Direct Loan on the basis of ability to benefit from its training and the student did not meet the eligibility requirements described in 34 CFR part 668 and section 484(d) of the Act, as applicable;

(ii) Signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory note without the borrower's authorization; or

(iii) Certified the eligibility of a student who, because of a physical or mental condition, age, criminal record, or other reason accepted by the Secretary, would not meet the requirements for employment (in the student's State of residence when the loan was originated) in the occupation for which the training program supported by the loan was intended.

(iv) Certified the individual's eligibility for a Direct Loan as a result of the crime of identity theft committed against the individual, as that crime is defined in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.

(2) *Unauthorized payment.* The Secretary discharges a borrower's (and any endorser's) obligation to repay a Direct Loan if the school, without the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's authorization for electronic funds transfer, unless the proceeds of the loan were delivered to the student or applied to charges owed by the student to the school.

(b) *Relief pursuant to discharge.* (1) Discharge for false certification under paragraph (a)(1) of this section relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any accrued charges and collection costs with respect to the loan.

(2) Discharge for unauthorized payment under paragraph (a)(2) of this section relieves the borrower of the obligation to repay the amount of the payment discharged.

(3) The discharge under this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on the discharged loan or payment.

(4) The Secretary does not regard a borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged under this section as in default on the loan after discharge, and such a borrower is eligible to receive assistance under programs authorized by title IV of the Act.

(5) The Secretary reports the discharge under this section to all consumer reporting agencies to which the Secretary previously reported the status of the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to the loan.

(c) *Borrower qualification for discharge.* In order to qualify for discharge under this section, the borrower must submit to the Secretary a written request and a sworn statement, and the factual assertions in the statement must be true. The statement need not be notarized but must be made by the borrower under penalty of perjury. In the statement, the borrower must meet the requirements in paragraphs (c) (1) through (6) of this section.

(1) *Ability to benefit.* In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge based on defective testing of the student's ability to benefit, the borrower must state that the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) -

(i) Received a disbursement of a loan, in whole or in part, on or after January 1, 1986 to attend a school; and

(ii) Received a Direct Loan at that school on the basis of an ability to benefit from the school's training and did not meet the eligibility requirements described in 34 CFR part 668 and section 484(d) of the Act, as applicable;

(2) *Unauthorized loan.* In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the school signed the borrower's name on the loan application or promissory note without the borrower's authorization, the borrower must -

(i) State that he or she did not sign the document in question or authorize the school to do so; and

(ii) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two of which must be within one year before or after the date of the contested signature.

(3) *Unauthorized payment.* In the case of a borrower requesting a discharge because the school, without the borrower's authorization, endorsed the borrower's loan check or signed the borrower's authorization for electronic funds transfer, the borrower must -

(i) State that he or she did not endorse the loan check or sign the authorization for electronic funds transfer or authorize the school to do so;

(ii) Provide five different specimens of his or her signature, two of which must be within one year before or after the date of the contested signature;

(iii) State that the proceeds of the contested disbursement were not delivered to the student or applied to charges owed by the student to the school.

(4) *Identity theft.* (i) In the case of an individual whose eligibility to borrow was falsely certified because he or she was a victim of the crime of identity theft and is requesting a discharge, the individual must -

(A) Certify that the individual did not sign the promissory note, or that any other means of identification used to obtain the loan was used without the authorization of the individual claiming relief;

(B) Certify that the individual did not receive or benefit from the proceeds of the loan with knowledge that the loan had been made without the authorization of the individual;

(C) Provide a copy of a local, State, or Federal court verdict or judgment that conclusively determines that the individual who is named as the borrower of the loan was the victim of a crime of identity theft; and

(D) If the judicial determination of the crime does not expressly state that the loan was obtained as a result of the crime of identity theft, provide -

(*1*) Authentic specimens of the signature of the individual, as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, or of other means of identification of the individual, as applicable, corresponding to the means of identification falsely used to obtain the loan; and

(*2*) A statement of facts that demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that eligibility for the loan in question was falsely certified as a result of the crime of identity theft committed against that individual.

(ii)(A) For purposes of this section, identity theft is defined as the unauthorized use of the identifying information of another individual that is punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1028, 1028A, 1029, or 1030, or substantially comparable State or local law.

(B) Identifying information includes, but is not limited to -

(*1*) Name, Social Security number, date of birth, official State or government issued driver's license or identification number, alien registration number, government passport number, and employer or taxpayer identification number;

(*2*) Unique biometric data, such as fingerprints, voiceprint, retina or iris image, or unique physical representation;

(*3*) Unique electronic identification number, address, or routing code; or

(*4*) Telecommunication identifying information or access device (as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1029(e)).

(5) *Claim to third party.* The borrower must state whether the borrower (or student) has made a claim with respect to the school's false certification or unauthorized payment with any third party, such as the holder of a performance bond or a tuition recovery program, and, if so, the amount of any payment received by the borrower (or student) or credited to the borrower's loan obligation.

(6) *Cooperation with Secretary.* The borrower must state that the borrower (or student) -

(i) Agrees to provide to the Secretary upon request other documentation reasonably available to the borrower that demonstrates that the borrower meets the qualifications for discharge under this section; and

(ii) Agrees to cooperate with the Secretary in enforcement actions as described in ยง 685.214(d) and to transfer any right to recovery against a third party to the Secretary as described in ยง 685.214(e).

(7) *Discharge without an application.* The Secretary may discharge a loan under this section without an application from the borrower if the Secretary determines, based on information in the Secretary's possession, that the borrower qualifies for a discharge.

(d) *Discharge procedures.* (1) If the Secretary determines that a borrower's Direct Loan may be eligible for a discharge under this section, the Secretary mails the borrower a disclosure application and an explanation of the qualifications and procedures for obtaining a discharge. The Secretary also promptly suspends any efforts to collect from the borrower on any affected loan. The Secretary may continue to receive borrower payments.

(2) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and sworn statement described in paragraph (c) of this section within 60 days of the Secretary's mailing the disclosure application, the Secretary resumes collection and grants forbearance of principal and interest for the period in which collection activity was suspended. The Secretary may capitalize any interest accrued and not paid during that period.

(3) If the borrower submits the written request and sworn statement described in paragraph (c) of the section, the Secretary determines whether to grant a request for discharge under this section by reviewing the request and sworn statement in light of information available from the Secretary's records and from other sources, including guaranty agencies, State authorities, and cognizant accrediting associations.

(4) If the Secretary determines that the borrower meets the applicable requirements for a discharge under paragraph (c) of this section, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that determination.

(5) If the Secretary determines that the borrower does not qualify for a discharge, the Secretary notifies the borrower in writing of that determination and the reasons for the determination.
