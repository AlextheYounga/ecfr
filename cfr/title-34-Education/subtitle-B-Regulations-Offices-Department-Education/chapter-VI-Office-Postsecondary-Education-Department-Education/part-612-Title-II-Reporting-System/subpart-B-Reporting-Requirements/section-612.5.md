##### ยง 612.5 What indicators must a State use to report on teacher preparation program performance for purposes of the State report card? #####

(a) For purposes of reporting under ยง 612.4, a State must assess, for each teacher preparation program within its jurisdiction, indicators of academic content knowledge and teaching skills of novice teachers from that program, including, at a minimum, the following indicators:

(1) Student learning outcomes.

(i) For each year and each teacher preparation program in the State, a State must calculate the aggregate student learning outcomes of all students taught by novice teachers.

(ii) For purposes of calculating student learning outcomes under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, a State must use:

(A) Student growth;

(B) A teacher evaluation measure;

(C) Another State-determined measure that is relevant to calculating student learning outcomes, including academic performance, and that meaningfully differentiates among teachers; or

(D) Any combination of paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(A), (B), or (C) of this section.

(iii) At the State's discretion, in calculating a teacher preparation program's aggregate student learning outcomes a State may exclude one or both of the following, provided that the State uses a consistent approach to assess and report on all of the teacher preparation programs in the State -

(A) Student learning outcomes of students taught by novice teachers who have taken teaching positions in another State.

(B) Student learning outcomes of all students taught by novice teachers who have taken teaching positions in private schools.

(2) Employment outcomes.

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, for each year and each teacher preparation program in the State, a State must calculate:

(A) Teacher placement rate;

(B) Teacher placement rate in high-need schools;

(C) Teacher retention rate; and

(D) Teacher retention rate in high-need schools.

(ii) For purposes of reporting the teacher retention rate and teacher retention rate in high-need schools under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(C) and (D) of this section -

(A) Except as provided in paragraph (B), the State reports a teacher retention rate for each of the three cohorts of novice teachers immediately preceding the current title II reporting year.

(B)(*1*) The State is not required to report a teacher retention rate for any teacher preparation program in the State report to be submitted in October 2018.

(*2*) For the State report to be submitted in October 2019, the teacher retention rate must be calculated for the cohort of novice teachers identified in the 2017-2018 title II reporting year.

(*3*) For the State report to be submitted in October 2020, separate teacher retention rates must be calculated for the cohorts of novice teachers identified in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 title II reporting years.

(iii) For the purposes of calculating employment outcomes under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, a State may, at its discretion, assess traditional and alternative route teacher preparation programs differently, provided that differences in assessments and the reasons for those differences are transparent and that assessments result in equivalent levels of accountability and reporting irrespective of the type of program.

(iv) For the purposes of the teacher placement rate under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, a State may, at its discretion, assess teacher preparation programs provided through distance education differently from teacher preparation programs not provided through distance education, based on whether the differences in the way the rate is calculated for teacher preparation programs provided through distance education affect employment outcomes. Differences in assessments and the reasons for those differences must be transparent and result in equivalent levels of accountability and reporting irrespective of where the program is physically located.

(v) A State is not required to calculate a teacher placement rate under paragraph (a)(2)(i)(A) of this section for alternative route to certification programs.

(3) *Survey outcomes.* (i) For each year and each teacher preparation program on which a State must report a State must collect through survey instruments qualitative and quantitative data including, but not limited to, a teacher survey and an employer survey designed to capture perceptions of whether novice teachers who are employed in their first year of teaching possess the academic content knowledge and teaching skills needed to succeed in the classroom.

(ii) At the State's discretion, in calculating a teacher preparation program's survey outcomes the State may exclude survey outcomes for all novice teachers who have taken teaching positions in private schools provided that the State uses a consistent approach to assess and report on all of the teacher preparation programs in the State.

(4) *Characteristics of teacher preparation programs.* Whether the program -

(i) Is administered by an entity accredited by an agency recognized by the Secretary for accreditation of professional teacher education programs; or

(ii) Produces teacher candidates -

(A) With content and pedagogical knowledge;

(B) With quality clinical preparation; and

(C) Who have met rigorous teacher candidate exit qualifications.

(b) At a State's discretion, the indicators of academic content knowledge and teaching skills may include other indicators of a teacher's effect on student performance, such as student survey results, provided that the State uses the same indicators for all teacher preparation programs in the State.

(c) A State may, at its discretion, exclude from its reporting under paragraph (a)(1)-(3) of this section individuals who have not become novice teachers after three years of becoming recent graduates.

(d) This section does not apply to American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the freely associated states of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands.
