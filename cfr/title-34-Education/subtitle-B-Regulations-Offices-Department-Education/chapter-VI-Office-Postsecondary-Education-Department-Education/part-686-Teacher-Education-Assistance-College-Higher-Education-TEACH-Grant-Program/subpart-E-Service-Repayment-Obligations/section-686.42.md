(a) *Death.* If a grant recipient dies, the Secretary discharges the obligation to complete the agreement to serve based on an original or certified copy of the grant recipient's death certificate, an accurate and complete photocopy of the original or certified copy of the grant recipient's death certificate, or, on a case-by-case basis, reliable documentation acceptable to the Secretary.

(b) *Total and permanent disability.* (1) A grant recipient's agreement to serve is discharged if the recipient becomes totally and permanently disabled, as defined in 34 CFR 682.200(b), and the grant recipient applies for and satisfies the eligibility requirements for a total and permanent disability discharge in accordance with 34 CFR 685.213.

(2) The eight-year time period in which the grant recipient must complete the service obligation remains in effect during the conditional discharge period described in 34 CFR 685.213(c)(2) unless the grant recipient is eligible for a suspension based on a condition that is a qualifying reason for leave under the FMLA in accordance with § 686.41(a)(1)(ii)(D).

(3) Interest continues to accrue on each TEACH Grant disbursement unless and until the TEACH Grant recipient's agreement to serve is discharged.

(4) If the grant recipient satisfies the criteria for a total and permanent disability discharge during and at the end of the three-year conditional discharge period, the Secretary discharges the grant recipient's service obligation.

(5) If, at any time during or at the end of the three-year conditional discharge period, the Secretary determines that the grant recipient does not meet the eligibility criteria for a total and permanent disability discharge, the Secretary ends the conditional discharge period and the grant recipient is once again subject to the terms of the agreement to serve.

(c) *Military discharge.* (1) A grant recipient who has completed or who has otherwise ceased enrollment in a TEACH Grant-eligible program for which he or she received TEACH Grant funds and has exceeded the period of time allowed under § 686.41(a)(2)(ii), may qualify for a proportional discharge of his or her service obligation due to an extended call or order to active duty status. To apply for a military discharge, a grant recipient or his or her representative must submit a written request to the Secretary.

(2) A grant recipient described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may receive a -

(i) One-year discharge of his or her service obligation if a call or order to active duty status is for more than three years;

(ii) Two-year discharge of his or her service obligation if a call or order to active duty status is for more than four years;

(iii) Three-year discharge of his or her service obligation if a call or order to active duty status is for more than five years; or

(iv) Full discharge of his or her service obligation if a call or order to active duty status is for more than six years.

(B) A copy of the grant recipient's military identification.

(4) For the purpose of this section, the Armed Forces means the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and the Coast Guard.

(5) Based on a request for a military discharge from the grant recipient or his or her representative, the Secretary will notify the grant recipient or his or her representative of the outcome of the discharge request. For the portion on the service obligation that remains, the grant recipient remains responsible for fulfilling his or her service obligation in accordance with § 686.12.
