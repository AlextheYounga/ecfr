(i) The reference to “program” in § 668.413(b)(3)(vi) is read to refer to “institution”;

(B) The Secretary will notify the institution if the appeal is -

(*1*) Granted and the institution qualifies for an exemption from the warning requirement under paragraph (h)(4) of this section; or

(*2*) Not granted, and the institution must comply with the warning requirement under paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

(3) *Loan repayment warning* - (i) *Promotional materials.* (A) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section, for any award year in which the institution's loan repayment rate shows that the median borrower has not either fully repaid, or made loan payments sufficient to reduce by at least one dollar the outstanding balance of, each of the borrower's FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the institution, the institution must, in all promotional materials that are made available to prospective or enrolled students by or on behalf of the institution, include a loan repayment warning in a form, place, and manner prescribed by the Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register. The warning language must read: “U.S. Department of Education Warning: A majority of recent student loan borrowers at this school are not paying down their loans,” unless stated otherwise by the Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register. Before publishing that notice, the Secretary may conduct consumer testing to help ensure that the warning is meaningful and helpful to students.

(i) That rate is based on fewer than 10 borrowers in the cohort described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section; or

(ii) The institution demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that not all of its programs constitute GE programs and that if the borrowers in the non-GE programs were included in the calculation of the loan repayment rate, the loan repayment rate would show that the median borrower has made loan payments sufficient to reduce by at least one dollar the outstanding balance of each of the borrower's FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the institution.

The Secretary will identify the triggering events for which a disclosure is required under paragraph (i)(1) in a document published in the Federal Register.

(3) *Form of disclosure.* The Secretary will conduct consumer testing to ensure the form of the disclosure is meaningful and helpful to students. The Secretary will specify the form and placement of the disclosure in a notice published in the Federal Register following the consumer testing.
