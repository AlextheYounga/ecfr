(a) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply to this subpart:

*Athletically related student aid* means any scholarship, grant, or other form of financial assistance, offered by an institution, the terms of which require the recipient to participate in a program of intercollegiate athletics at the institution. Other student aid, of which a student-athlete simply happens to be the recipient, is not athletically related student aid.

*Certificate or degree-seeking student* means a student enrolled in a course of credit who is recognized by the institution as seeking a degree or certificate.

*First-time undergraduate student* means an entering undergraduate who has never attended any institution of higher education.

*Normal time* is the amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog.

(i) The reference to “program” in § 668.413(b)(3)(vi) is read to refer to “institution”;

(2) *Issuing and appealing loan repayment rates.* (i) For each award year, the Secretary notifies an institution of its final loan repayment rate.

(ii) If an institution's final loan repayment rate shows that the median borrower has not either fully repaid all FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the institution or made loan payments sufficient to reduce by at least one dollar the outstanding balance of each of the borrower's FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the institution -

(A) Using the calculation described in paragraph (h)(4)(ii) of this section, the institution may submit an appeal to the Secretary within 15 days of receiving notification of its final loan repayment rate; and

(B) The Secretary will notify the institution if the appeal is -

(*1*) Granted and the institution qualifies for an exemption from the warning requirement under paragraph (h)(4) of this section; or

(*2*) Not granted, and the institution must comply with the warning requirement under paragraph (h)(3) of this section.

(3) *Loan repayment warning* - (i) *Promotional materials.* (A) Except as provided in paragraph (h)(4) of this section, for any award year in which the institution's loan repayment rate shows that the median borrower has not either fully repaid, or made loan payments sufficient to reduce by at least one dollar the outstanding balance of, each of the borrower's FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the institution, the institution must, in all promotional materials that are made available to prospective or enrolled students by or on behalf of the institution, include a loan repayment warning in a form, place, and manner prescribed by the Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register. The warning language must read: “U.S. Department of Education Warning: A majority of recent student loan borrowers at this school are not paying down their loans,” unless stated otherwise by the Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register. Before publishing that notice, the Secretary may conduct consumer testing to help ensure that the warning is meaningful and helpful to students.

(B) Promotional materials include, but are not limited to, an institution's Web site, catalogs, invitations, flyers, billboards, and advertising on or through radio, television, video, print media, social media, or the Internet.

(ii) *Clarity of warning.* The institution must ensure that the warning is prominent, clear, and conspicuous.

In written materials, including email, Internet advertising and promotional materials, print media, and other advertising or hard-copy promotional materials, the warning must be included on the cover page or home page and any other pages with information on a program of study and any pages with information on costs and financial aid. For television and video materials, the warning must be both spoken and written simultaneously. The Secretary may require the institution to modify its promotional materials, including its Web site, if the warning is not prominent, clear, and conspicuous.

(4) *Exemptions.* An institution is not required to provide a warning under paragraph (h)(3) of this section based on a final loan repayment rate for that award year if -

(i) That rate is based on fewer than 10 borrowers in the cohort described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section; or

(ii) The institution demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that not all of its programs constitute GE programs and that if the borrowers in the non-GE programs were included in the calculation of the loan repayment rate, the loan repayment rate would show that the median borrower has made loan payments sufficient to reduce by at least one dollar the outstanding balance of each of the borrower's FFEL or Direct Loans received for enrollment in the institution.

(i) *Financial protection disclosures* - (1) *General.* An institution must deliver a disclosure to enrolled and prospective students in the form and manner described in paragraph (i)(3), (4), and (5) of this section, and post that disclosure to its Web site as described in paragraph (i)(6) of this section, within 30 days of notifying the Secretary under § 668.171(h) of the occurrence of a triggering event or events identified pursuant to paragraph (i)(2) of this section. The requirements in this paragraph (i) apply for the 12-month period following the date the institution notifies the Secretary under § 668.171(h) of a triggering event or events identified under paragraph (i)(2).

(2) *Triggering events.* The Secretary will conduct consumer testing to inform the identification of events for which a disclosure is required. The Secretary will consumer test each of the events identified in § 668.171(c) through (g), as well as other events that result in an institution being required to provide financial protection to the Department, to determine which of these events are most meaningful to students in their educational decision-making. The Secretary will identify the triggering events for which a disclosure is required under paragraph (i)(1) in a document published in the Federal Register.

(3) *Form of disclosure.* The Secretary will conduct consumer testing to ensure the form of the disclosure is meaningful and helpful to students. The Secretary will specify the form and placement of the disclosure in a notice published in the Federal Register following the consumer testing.
