Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 49913, Sept. 23, 2019.

(a) *General.* An institution that is not financially responsible under the general standards and provisions in § 668.171, may begin or continue to participate in the title IV, HEA programs by qualifying under an alternate standard set forth in this section.

(b) *Letter of credit alternative for new institutions.* A new institution that is not financially responsible solely because the Secretary determines that its composite score is less than 1.5, qualifies as a financially responsible institution by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit, that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount equal to at least one-half of the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that the Secretary determines the institution will receive during its initial year of participation. A new institution is an institution that seeks to participate for the first time in the title IV, HEA programs.

(c) *Letter of credit alternative for participating institutions.* A participating institution that is not financially responsible either because it does not satisfy one or more of the standards of financial responsibility under § 668.171(b) through (g), or because of an audit opinion described under § 668.171(j), qualifies as a financially responsible institution by submitting an irrevocable letter of credit or other form of financial protection specified by the Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register, that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount determined by the Secretary that is not less than one-half of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year.

(d) *Zone alternative.* (1) A participating institution that is not financially responsible solely because the Secretary determines that its composite score under § 668.172 is less than 1.5 may participate in the title IV, HEA programs as a financially responsible institution for no more than three consecutive years, beginning with the year in which the Secretary determines that the institution qualifies under this alternative.

(i)(A) An institution qualifies initially under this alternative if, based on the institution's audited financial statement for its most recently completed fiscal year, the Secretary determines that its composite score is in the range from 1.0 to 1.4; and

(B) An institution continues to qualify under this alternative if, based on the institution's audited financial statement for each of its subsequent two fiscal years, the Secretary determines that the institution's composite score is in the range from 1.0 to 1.4.

(ii) An institution that qualified under this alternative for three consecutive years, or for one of those years, may not seek to qualify again under this alternative until the year after the institution achieves a composite score of at least 1.5, as determined by the Secretary.

(2) Under the zone alternative, the Secretary -

(i) Requires the institution to make disbursements to eligible students and parents, and to otherwise comply with the provisions, under either the heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement payment method described in § 668.162;

(ii) Requires the institution to provide timely information regarding any of the following oversight and financial events -

(A) Any event that causes the institution, or related entity as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 850, to realize any liability that was noted as a contingent liability in the institution's or related entity's most recent audited financial statement; or

(B) Any losses that are unusual in nature or infrequently occur, or both, as defined in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 and ASC 225;

(iii) May require the institution to submit its financial statement and compliance audits earlier than the time specified under § 668.23(a)(4); and

(iv) May require the institution to provide information about its current operations and future plans.

(3) Under the zone alternative, the institution must -

(i) For any oversight or financial event described in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section for which the institution is required to provide information, in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary, notify the Secretary no later than 10 days after that event occurs; and

(ii) As part of its compliance audit, require its auditor to express an opinion on the institution's compliance with the requirements under the zone alternative, including the institution's administration of the payment method under which the institution received and disbursed title IV, HEA program funds.

(4) If an institution fails to comply with the requirements under paragraph (d)(2) or (3) of this section, the Secretary may determine that the institution no longer qualifies under this alternative.

(e) [Reserved]

(f) *Provisional certification alternative.* (1) The Secretary may permit an institution that is not financially responsible to participate in the title IV, HEA programs under a provisional certification for no more than three consecutive years if, as determined annually by the Secretary -

(i) The institution is not financially responsible because it does not satisfy the general standards under § 668.171(b)(1) or (3), its recalculated composite score under § 668.171(c)(2) is less than 1.0, is subject to an action or event under § 668.171(d), (e), (f),or (g) or because of an audit opinion described in § 668.171(i); or

(ii) The institution is not financially responsible because of a condition of past performance, as provided under § 668.174(a), and the institution demonstrates to the Secretary that it has satisfied or resolved that condition.

(2) Under this alternative, the institution must -

(i) Provide to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, agree to a set-aside under paragraph (h) of this section, or, at the Secretary's discretion, provide another form of financial protection specified by the Secretary in a notice published in the Federal Register, for an amount determined by the Secretary under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, except that this requirement does not apply to a public institution; and

(ii) Comply with the provisions under the zone alternative, as provided under paragraph (d)(2) and (3).

(3) If at the end of the period for which the Secretary provisionally certified the institution, the institution is still not financially responsible, the Secretary -

(i) May permit the institution to participate under a provisional certification, but -

(A) May require the institution, or one or more persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution, as determined under § 668.174(b)(1) and (c), or both, to provide to the Secretary financial protection for an amount determined by the Secretary under paragraph (f)(4) of this section; and

(B) May require one or more of the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution, as determined under § 668.174(b)(1) and (c), to be jointly or severally liable for any liabilities that may arise from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs; and

(ii) May permit the institution to continue to participate under a provisional certification but requires the institution to provide, or continue to provide, the financial protection resulting from an event described in § 668.171(c) through (g) until the institution meets the requirements of paragraph (f)(5) of this section.

(4)(i) The institution must provide to the Secretary the financial protection described under paragraph (f)(2)(i) in an amount that, together with the amount of any financial protection that the institution has already provided if that protection covers the period described in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, equals, for a composite score calculated under § 668.172, a composite score recalculated under § 668.171(c)(2), or for any other reason that the institution is not financially responsible -

(A) Ten percent of the total amount of title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year; and

(B) Any additional amount that the Secretary demonstrates is needed under paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section.

(ii) The Secretary determines the amount specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) of this section that must be provided by the institution in addition to the amount specified in paragraph (f)(4)(i)(A) of this section, and must ensure that the total amount of financial protection provided under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section is sufficient to fully cover any estimated losses. The Secretary may reduce the amount required under paragraph (f)(4)(i)(B) only if an institution demonstrates that this amount is unnecessary to protect, or is contrary to, the Federal interest.

(5) The Secretary maintains the full amount of the financial protection provided by the institution under paragraph (f)(4) of this section until the Secretary first determines that the institution has -

(i) A composite score of 1.0 or greater based on the review of the audited financial statements for the fiscal year in which all losses from any event described in § 668.171(c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) on which financial protection was required have been fully recognized; or

(ii) A recalculated composite score of 1.0 or greater, and any event or condition described in § 668.171(d), (e), (f), or (g) has ceased to exist.

(g) *Provisional certification alternative for persons or entities owing liabilities.* (1) The Secretary may permit an institution that is not financially responsible because the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution owe a liability for a violation of a title IV, HEA program requirement, to participate in the title IV, HEA programs under a provisional certification only if -

(i)(A) The persons or entities that exercise substantial control, as determined under § 668.174(b)(1) and (c), repay or enter into an agreement with the Secretary to repay the applicable portion of that liability, as provided under § 668.174(b)(2)(ii); or

(B) The institution assumes that liability, and repays or enters into an agreement with the Secretary to repay that liability;

(ii) The institution satisfies the general standards and provisions of financial responsibility under § 668.171(b) and (d)(1), except that institution must demonstrate that it was current on its debt payments and has met all of its financial obligations, as required under § 668.171 (b)(3) and (b)(4), for its two most recent fiscal years; and

(iii) The institution submits to the Secretary an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable and payable to the Secretary, for an amount determined by the Secretary that is not less than 10 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year.

(2) Under this alternative, the Secretary -

(i) Requires the institution to comply with the provisions under the zone alternative, as provided under paragraph (d) (2) and (3) of this section;

(ii) May require the institution, or one or more persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution, or both, to submit to the Secretary financial guarantees for an amount determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to satisfy any potential liabilities that may arise from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs; and

(iii) May require one or more of the persons or entities that exercise substantial control over the institution to be jointly or severally liable for any liabilities that may arise from the institution's participation in the title IV, HEA programs.

(h) *Set-aside.* If an institution does not provide a letter of credit or financial protection acceptable to the Secretary for the amount required under paragraph (d) or (f) of this section within 45 days of the Secretary's request, the Secretary offsets the amount of title IV, HEA program funds that an institution is eligible to receive in a manner that ensures that, no later than the end of a nine-month period, the total amount offset equals the amount of financial protection the institution would otherwise provide. The Secretary uses the funds to satisfy the debt and liabilities owed to the Secretary that are not otherwise paid directly by the institution, and provides to the institution any funds not used for this purpose during the period for which the financial protection was required, or provides the institution any remaining funds if the institution subsequently submits the financial protection originally required under paragraph (d) or (f) of this section.
