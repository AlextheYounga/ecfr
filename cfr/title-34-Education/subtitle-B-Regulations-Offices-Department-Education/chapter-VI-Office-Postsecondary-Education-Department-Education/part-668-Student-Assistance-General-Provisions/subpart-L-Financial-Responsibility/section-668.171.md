##### § 668.171 General. #####

(a) *Purpose.* To begin and to continue to participate in any title IV, HEA program, an institution must demonstrate to the Secretary that it is financially responsible under the standards established in this subpart. As provided under section 498(c)(1) of the HEA, the Secretary determines whether an institution is financially responsible based on the institution's ability to -

(1) Provide the services described in its official publications and statements;

(2) Meet all of its financial obligations; and

(3) Provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with title IV, HEA program requirements.

(b) *General standards of financial responsibility.* Except as provided under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, the Secretary considers an institution to be financially responsible if the Secretary determines that -

(1) The institution's Equity, Primary Reserve, and Net Income ratios yield a composite score of at least 1.5, as provided under § 668.172 and appendices A and B to this subpart;

(2) The institution has sufficient cash reserves to make required returns of unearned title IV, HEA program funds, as provided under § 668.173;

(3) The institution is able to meet all of its financial obligations and otherwise provide the administrative resources necessary to comply with title IV, HEA program requirements. An institution may not be able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if it is subject to an action or event described in paragraph (c), (d), (e), (f), or (g) of this section. The Secretary considers those actions or events in determining whether the institution is financially responsible only if they occur on or after July 1, 2017; and

(4) The institution or persons affiliated with the institution are not subject to a condition of past performance under § 668.174(a) or (b).

(c) *Debts, liabilities, and losses.* (1) Except as provided under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, an institution is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations under paragraph (b)(3) of this section if, after the end of the fiscal year for which the Secretary has most recently calculated an institution's composite score, the institution is subject to one or more of the following actions or triggering events, and as a result of the actual or potential debts, liabilities, or losses that have stemmed or may stem from those actions or events, the institution's recalculated composite score is less than 1.0, as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (c)(2) of this section:

(i) *Debts and borrower defense-related lawsuits.* (A) The institution is required to pay any debt or incur any liability arising from a final judgment in a judicial proceeding or from an administrative proceeding or determination, or from a settlement; or

(B) The institution is being sued in an action brought on or after July 1, 2017 by a Federal or State authority for financial relief on claims related to the making of the Direct Loan for enrollment at the school or the provision of educational services and the suit has been pending for 120 days.

(ii) *Other litigation.* The institution is being sued in an action brought on or after July 1, 2017 that is not described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section and -

(A) The institution has filed a motion for summary judgment or summary disposition and that motion has been denied or the court has issued an order reserving judgment on the motion;

(B) The institution has not filed a motion for summary judgment or summary disposition by the deadline set for such motions by the court or agreement of the parties; or

(C) If the court did not set a deadline for filing a motion for summary judgment and the institution did not file such a motion, the court has set a pretrial conference date or trial date and the case is pending on the earlier of those two dates.

(iii) *Accrediting agency actions.* The institution was required by its accrediting agency to submit a teach-out plan, for a reason described in § 602.24(c)(1), that covers the closing of the institution or any of its branches or additional locations.

(iv) *Gainful employment.* As determined annually by the Secretary, the institution has gainful employment programs that, under § 668.403, could become ineligible based on their final D/E rates for the next award year.

(v) *Withdrawal of owner's equity.* For a proprietary institution whose composite score is less than 1.5, any withdrawal of owner's equity from the institution by any means, including by declaring a dividend, unless the transfer is to an entity included in the affiliated entity group on whose basis the institution's composite score was calculated.

(2) *Recalculating the composite score* - (i) *General.* Unless the institution demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the event or condition has had or will have no effect on the assets and liabilities of the institution under paragraph (g)(3)(iv) of this section, as specified in Appendix C of this subpart, the Secretary recognizes and accounts for the actual or potential losses associated with the actions or events under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and, based on that accounting, recalculates the institution's most recent composite score. The recalculation will occur regularly after associated actions or events are reported to the Secretary. The Secretary recalculates the composite score under this paragraph using the financial statements on which the institution's composite score has been calculated under § 668.172.

(ii) *Calculation of potential loss - debts and borrower defense-related lawsuits.* For a debt or a suit described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the amount of loss is -

(B) For a suit, the amount set by a court ruling, or, in the absence of a court ruling -

(*1*) The amount of relief claimed in the complaint;

(*2*) If the complaint demands no specific amount of relief, the amount stated in any final written demand issued by the agency to the institution prior to the suit or a lesser amount that the agency offers to accept in settlement of any financial demand in the suit; or

(*3*) If the agency stated no specific demand in the complaint, in a pre-filing demand, or in a written offer of settlement, the amount of tuition and fees received by the institution during the period, and for the program or location, described in the allegations in the complaint.

(B) For the withdrawal of owner's equity, described in paragraph (c)(1)(v) of this section, the amount of loss is the amount transferred to any entity other than the institution.

(i) For a suit by a Federal or State agency described in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(B) of this section, the amount claimed in the complaint or determined under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section exceeds the potential recovery because the allegations in the complaint, if accepted as true, and the claims asserted, if fully successful, cannot produce relief in the amount claimed or, if no amount was claimed, the amount deemed under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) because they pertain to a period, program, or location for which the full recovery possible is a lesser amount;

(j) *Audit opinions.* Even if an institution satisfies all of the general standards of financial responsibility under paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary does not consider the institution to be financially responsible if, in the institution's audited financial statements, the opinion expressed by the auditor was an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion, or the auditor expressed doubt about the continued existence of the institution as a going concern, unless the Secretary determines that a qualified or disclaimed opinion does not significantly bear on the institution's financial condition.

(k) *Administrative actions.* If the Secretary determines that an institution is not financially responsible under the standards and provisions of this section or under an alternative standard in § 668.175, or the institution does not submit its financial and compliance audits by the date and in the manner required under § 668.23, the Secretary may -
