##### § 668.410 Consequences of the D/E rates measure. #####

(a) *Student warning* - (1) *Events requiring a warning to students and prospective students.* The institution must provide a warning with respect to a GE program to students and to prospective students for any year for which the Secretary notifies an institution that the program could become ineligible based on its final D/E rates measure for the next award year.
