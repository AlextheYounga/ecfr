##### § 668.504 Draft program cohort default rates and your ability to challenge before official program cohort default rates are issued. #####

(a) *General.* (1) We notify you of the draft program cohort default rate of a GE program before the official program cohort default rate of the GE program is calculated. Our notice includes the loan record detail report for the draft program cohort default rate.

(2) Except as provided in § 668.502(d)(2)(i), regardless of the number of borrowers included in the program cohort, the draft program cohort default rate of a GE program is always calculated using data for that fiscal year alone, using the method described in § 668.502(d)(1).

(3) The draft program cohort default rate of a GE program and the loan record detail report are not considered public information and may not be otherwise voluntarily released to the public by a data manager.

(4) Any challenge you submit under this section and any response provided by a data manager must be in a format acceptable to us. This acceptable format is described in materials that we provide to you. If your challenge does not comply with these requirements, we may deny your challenge.

(b) *Incorrect data challenges.* (1) You may challenge the accuracy of the data included on the loan record detail report by sending a challenge to the relevant data manager, or data managers, within 45 days after you receive the data. Your challenge must include -

(i) A description of the information in the loan record detail report that you believe is incorrect; and

(ii) Documentation that supports your contention that the data are incorrect.

(2) Within 30 days after receiving your challenge, the data manager must send you and us a response that -

(i) Addresses each of your allegations of error; and

(ii) Includes the documentation that supports the data manager's position.

(3) If your data manager concludes that draft data in the loan record detail report are incorrect, and we agree, we use the corrected data to calculate your program cohort default rate.

(4) If you fail to challenge the accuracy of data under this section, you cannot contest the accuracy of those data in an uncorrected data adjustment under § 668.509, or in an erroneous data appeal, under § 668.511.
