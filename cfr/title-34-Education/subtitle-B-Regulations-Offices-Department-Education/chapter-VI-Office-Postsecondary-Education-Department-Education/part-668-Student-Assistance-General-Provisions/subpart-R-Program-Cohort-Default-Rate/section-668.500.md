##### § 668.500 Purpose of this subpart. #####

*General.* The program cohort default rate is a measure of a GE program offered by the institution. This subpart describes how program cohort default rates are calculated, and how you may request changes to your program cohort default rates or appeal the rate. Under this subpart, you submit a “challenge” after you receive your draft program cohort default rate, and you request an “adjustment” or “appeal” after your official program cohort default rate is published.
