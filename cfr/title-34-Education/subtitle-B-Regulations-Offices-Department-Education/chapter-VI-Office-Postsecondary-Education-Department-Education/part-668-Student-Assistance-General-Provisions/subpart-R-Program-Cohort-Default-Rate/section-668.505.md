##### ยง 668.505 Notice of the official program cohort default rate of a GE program. #####

(a) We notify you of the official program cohort default rate of a GE program after we calculate it. After we send our notice to you, we publish a list of GE program cohort default rates for all institutions.

(b) If one or more borrowers who were enrolled in a GE program entered repayment in the fiscal year for which the rate is calculated, you will receive a loan record detail report as part of your notification package for that program.

(c) You have five business days, from the date of our notification, as posted on the Department's Web site, to report any problem with receipt of the notification package.

(d) Except as provided in paragraph (e), timelines for submitting, adjustments, and appeals begin on the sixth business day following the date of the notification package that is posted on the Department's Web site.

(e) If you timely report a problem with receipt of your notification package under paragraph (c) of this section and the Department agrees that the problem was not caused by you, the Department will extend the challenge, appeal, and adjustment deadlines and timeframes to account for a re-notification package.
