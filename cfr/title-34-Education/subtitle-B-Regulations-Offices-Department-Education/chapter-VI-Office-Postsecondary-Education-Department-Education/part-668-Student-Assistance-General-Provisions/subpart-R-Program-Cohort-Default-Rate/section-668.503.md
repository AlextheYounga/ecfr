##### § 668.503 Determining program cohort default rates for GE programs at institutions that have undergone a change in status. #####

(a) *General.* (1) If you undergo a change in status identified in this section, the program cohort default rate of a GE program you offer is determined under this section.

(2) In determining program cohort default rates under this section, the date of a merger, acquisition, or other change in status is the date the change occurs.

(3) [Reserved]

(4) If the program cohort default rate of a program offered by another institution is applicable to you under this section with respect to a program you offer, you may challenge, request an adjustment, or submit an appeal for the program cohort default rate under the same requirements that would be applicable to the other institution under §§ 668.504 and 668.508.

(b) *Acquisition or merger of institutions.* If you offer a GE program and your institution acquires, or was created by the merger of, one or more institutions that participated independently in the title IV, HEA programs immediately before the acquisition or merger and that offered the same GE program, as identified by its 6-digit CIP code and credential level -

(1) Those program cohort default rates published for a GE program offered by any of these institutions before the date of the acquisition or merger are attributed to the GE program after the merger or acquisition; and

(2) Beginning with the first program cohort default rate published after the date of the acquisition or merger, the program cohort default rates for that GE program are determined by including in the calculation under § 668.502 the borrowers who were enrolled in that GE program from each institution that offered that program and that was involved in the acquisition or merger.

(c) [Reserved]

(d) *Branches or locations becoming institutions.* If you are a branch or location of an institution that is participating in the title IV, HEA programs, and you become a separate, new institution for the purposes of participating in those programs -

(1) The program cohort default rates published for a GE program before the date of the change for your former parent institution are also applicable to you when you offer that program;

(2) Beginning with the first program cohort default rate published after the date of the change, the program cohort default rates for a GE program for the next three fiscal years are determined by including the applicable borrowers who were enrolled in the GE program from your institution and from your former parent institution (including all of its locations) in the calculation under § 668.502.
