##### ยง 654.51 What are the continuing eligibility criteria? #####

(a) A scholar continues to be eligible for scholarship funds as long as the scholar continues to -

(1) Meet the eligibility requirements in ยง 654.40(b), (e), and (f);

(2) Be enrolled as a full-time student at an institution of higher education except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(3) Maintain satisfactory progress as determined by the institution of higher education the scholar is attending, in accordance with the criteria established in 34 CFR 668.14(e) of the Student Assistance General Provisions regulations.

(b) In order to be eligible for scholarship funds, a scholar must be enrolled full time for the first year of study. If after the first year of study, the SEA determines that unusual circumstances justify waiver of the full-time attendance requirement, the scholar may enroll part time and continue to receive a scholarship payment. The SEA shall prorate the payment according to the scholar's enrollment status for the academic period during which he or she continues to be enrolled on a part-time basis but remains otherwise eligible for the award. For example, if a scholar for whom the full-time enrollment requirement is waived by the SEA is enrolled as a half-time student for one semester, he or she is eligible to receive one-quarter of his or her scholarship during that semester.
