(a)(1) An SEA may permit a scholar to postpone or interrupt his or her enrollment at an institution of higher education without forfeiting his or her scholarship for up to 12 months, beginning on the date the scholar otherwise would have enrolled in the institution after the SEA awarded his or her scholarship or the date the scholar interrupts enrollment.

(2) A scholar who postpones or interrupts his or her enrollment at an institution of higher education in accordance with standards established by the SEA is not eligible to receive scholarship funds during the period of postponement or interruption, but is eligible to receive scholarship payments on enrollment or re-enrollment at an institution of higher education.

(3) A scholar's periods of postponement or interruption, taken in accordance with standards established by the SEA and not in excess of 12 months, are not considered periods of suspension for the purposes of calculating the 12 months provided for suspension prior to termination under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if an SEA finds that a scholar fails to meet the requirements of ยง 654.51 within an award year, it shall suspend the scholar's eligibility to receive scholarship funds until the scholar is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the SEA that he or she meets these requirements.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, a scholar's eligibility for a scholarship is terminated when the total of his or her suspension periods exceeds 12 months.

(3) In exceptional circumstances, the SEA may extend the 12-month suspension period without terminating a scholar's eligibility under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, in accordance with standards established by the SEA.

(c) A scholar who receives an award for a period for which the SEA subsequently determines the scholar was ineligible under the requirements in ยง 654.40 or 654.51 shall repay to the SEA the total amount of the scholarship funds received for the period during which he or she was ineligible.
