##### ยง 654.21 How does the Secretary determine the amount of the grant to each participating State? #####

(a) From the funds appropriated for this program, the Secretary allots to each participating State a grant equal to $1,500 multiplied by the number of scholarships the Secretary determines to be available to that State on the basis of the formula described in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) The number of scholarships that the Secretary allots to each participating State for any fiscal year bears the same ratio to the number of scholarships allotted to all participating States as each State's population ages 5 through 17 which is derived from the most recently available data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census bears to the population ages 5 through 17 in all participating States, except that -

(1) Not fewer than 10 scholarships are allotted to any participating State; and

(2) The District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (Palau) each are allotted 10 scholarships.
