(a) *Repayment Plan.* (1) The institution shall establish a repayment plan before the student ceases to be at least a half-time regular student.

(2) If the last scheduled payment would be $25 or less the institution may combine it with the next-to-last repayment.

(3) If the installment payment for all loans made to a borrower by an institution is not a multiple of $5, the institution may round that payment to the next highest dollar amount that is a multiple of $5.

(4) The institution shall apply any payment on a loan in the following order:

(i) Collection costs.

(ii) Late charges.

(iii) Accrued interest.

(iv) Principal.

(b) *Minimum monthly repayment* - (1) *Minimum monthly repayment option.* (i) An institution may require a borrower to pay a minimum monthly repayment if -

(A) The promissory note includes a minimum monthly repayment provision specifying the amount of the minimum monthly repayment; and

(B) The monthly repayment of principal and interest for a 10-year repayment period is less than the minimum monthly repayment; or

(ii) An institution may require a borrower to pay a minimum monthly repayment if the borrower has received loans with different interest rates at the same institution and the total monthly repayment would otherwise be less than the minimum monthly repayment.

(2) *Minimum monthly repayment of loans from more than one institution.* If a borrower has received loans from more than one institution and has notified the institution that he or she wants the minimum monthly payment determination to be based on payments due to other institutions, the following rules apply:

(i) If the total of the monthly repayments is equal to at least the minimum monthly repayment, no institution may exercise a minimum monthly repayment option.

(ii) If only one institution exercises the minimum monthly repayment option when the monthly repayment would otherwise be less than the minimum repayment option, that institution receives the difference between the minimum monthly repayment and the repayment owed to the other institution.

(iii) If each institution exercises the minimum repayment option, the minimum monthly repayment must be divided among the institutions in proportion to the amount of principal advanced by each institution.

(3) *Minimum monthly repayment of both Defense and NDSL or Federal Perkins loans from one or more institutions.* If the borrower has notified the institution that he or she wants the minimum monthly payment determination to be based on payments due to other institutions, and if the total monthly repayment is less than $30 and the monthly repayment on a Defense loan is less than $15 a month, the amount attributed to the Defense loan may not exceed $15 a month.

(4) *Minimum monthly repayment of loans with differing grace periods and deferments.* If the borrower has received loans with different grace periods and deferments, the institution shall treat each note separately, and the borrower shall pay the applicable minimum monthly payment for a loan that is not in the grace or deferment period.

(5) *Hardship.* The institution may reduce the borrower's scheduled repayments for a period of not more than one year at a time if -

(i) It determines that the borrower is unable to make the scheduled repayments due to hardship (see § 674.33(c)); and

(iii) $40 for a Federal Perkins loan made on or after October 1, 1992, to a borrower who, on the date the loan is made, has no outstanding balance of principal or interest owing on any loan made under this part.

(7) The institution shall determine the minimum repayment amount under paragraph (b) of this section for loans with repayment installment intervals greater than one month by multiplying the amounts in paragraph (b) of this section by the number of months in the installment interval.

(c) *Extension of repayment period* - (1) *Hardship.* The institution may extend a borrower's repayment period due to prolonged illness or unemployment.

(2) *Low-income individual.* (i) For Federal Perkins loans and NDSLs made on or after October 1, 1980, the institution may extend the borrower's repayment period up to 10 additional years beyond the 10-year maximum repayment period if the institution determines during the course of the repayment period that the borrower is a “low-income individual.” The borrower qualifies for an extension of the repayment period on the basis of low-income status only during the period in which the borrower meets the criteria described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) (A) or (B) of this section. The term *low-income individual* means the following:

(A) For an unmarried borrower without dependents, an individual whose total income for the preceding calendar year did not exceed 45 percent of the Income Protection Allowance for the current award year for a family of four with one in college.

(ii) The institution shall use the Income Protection Allowance published annually in accordance with section 478 of the HEA in making this determination.

(iii) The institution shall review the borrower's status annually to determine whether the borrower continues to qualify for an extended repayment period based on his or her status as a “low-income individual.”

(iv) Upon determining that a borrower ceases to qualify for an extended repayment period under this section, the institution shall amend the borrower's repayment schedule. The term of the amended repayment schedule may not exceed the number of months remaining on the original repayment schedule, provided that the institution may not include the time elapsed during any extension of the repayment period granted under this section in determining the number of months remaining on the original repayment schedule.

(3) Interest continues to accrue during any extension of a repayment period.

(d) *Forbearance.* (1) Forbearance means the temporary cessation of payments, allowing an extension of time for making payments, or temporarily accepting smaller payments than previously were scheduled.

(ii) The student borrower pays in a single lump-sum payment -

(A) 90 percent of the outstanding principal balance on the loan under this part;

(B) The interest due on the loan; and

(C) Any collection fees due on the loan.

(2) The Federal share of the compromise repayment must bear the same relation to the institution's share of the compromise repayment as the Federal capital contribution to the institution's loan Fund under this part bears to the institution's capital contribution to the Fund.

(f)(1) *Incentive repayment program.* An institution may establish the following repayment incentives:

(i) A reduction of no more than one percent of the interest rate on a loan on which the borrower has made 48 consecutive, monthly repayments.

(2) *Relief pursuant to discharge.* (i) Discharge under this section relieves the borrower of any past or present obligation to repay the loan and any accrued interest or collection costs with respect to the loan.

(ii) The discharge of a loan under this section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid voluntarily or through enforced collection on the loan.

The Secretary reviews the materials, makes an independent determination, and notifies the borrower in writing of the determination and the reasons for the determination.

(ix) In the case of a loan held by a school and discharged by either the school or the Secretary, the school must reimburse its Fund for the entire amount of any outstanding principal and interest on the loan, and any collection costs charged to the Fund as a result of collection efforts on a discharged loan.
