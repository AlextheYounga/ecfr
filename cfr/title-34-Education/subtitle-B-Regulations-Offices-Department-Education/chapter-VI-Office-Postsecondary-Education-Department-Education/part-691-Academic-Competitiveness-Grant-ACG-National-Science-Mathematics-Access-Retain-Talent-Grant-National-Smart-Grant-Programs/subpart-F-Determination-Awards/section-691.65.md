##### ยง 691.65 Transfer student. #####

(a) If a student who receives a grant under this part at one institution subsequently enrolls at a second institution in the same award year, the student may receive a grant at the second institution only if -

(1)(i) The student submits a valid SAR to the second institution; or

(ii) The second institution obtains a valid ISIR; and

(2) The student is receiving a Federal Pell Grant in the same award year.

(b) The second institution shall calculate the student's award according to ยง 691.63.

(c) The second institution may pay a grant only for that portion of the year of the student's eligible program in which a student is enrolled at that institution. The grant amount must be adjusted, if necessary, to ensure that the grant does not exceed the student's ACG or National SMART Grant Scheduled Award for the student's year at the second institution.

(d) If a student transfers between award years and the student's ACG or National SMART Grant Scheduled Award at the second institution differs from the ACG or National SMART Grant Scheduled Award at the first institution for that year of the student's eligible program, the grant amount at the second institution is calculated as follows -

(1) The amount received at the first institution is compared to the ACG or National SMART Grant Scheduled Award at the first institution to determine the percentage of the ACG or National SMART Grant Scheduled Award that the student has received.

(2) That percentage is subtracted from 100 percent.

(3) The remaining percentage is the percentage of the ACG or National SMART Grant Scheduled Award at the second institution to which the student is entitled.

(e) The student's ACG or National SMART Grant payment for each payment period is calculated according to the procedures in ยง 691.63 unless the remaining percentage of the ACG or National SMART Grant Scheduled Award at the second institution, referred to in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, is less than the amount the student would normally receive for that payment period. In that case, the student's payment is equal to that remaining percentage.

(f) A transfer student shall repay any amount received that exceeds his or her ACG or National SMART Grant Scheduled Award for a year in accordance with ยง 691.79.
