##### § 691.75 Determination of eligibility for payment. #####

(i) Fifty percent of the credit or clock hours of the payment period for which the student is being paid; or

(ii) For a credit-hour program, 50 percent of the academic coursework of the payment period for which the student is being paid if the institution is unable to determine when the student has completed one-half of the credit hours of the payment period; and

(4) If enrolled in a credit-hour program without terms or a clock-hour program, has completed the payment period as defined in 34 CFR 668.4 for which he or she has been paid a grant.
