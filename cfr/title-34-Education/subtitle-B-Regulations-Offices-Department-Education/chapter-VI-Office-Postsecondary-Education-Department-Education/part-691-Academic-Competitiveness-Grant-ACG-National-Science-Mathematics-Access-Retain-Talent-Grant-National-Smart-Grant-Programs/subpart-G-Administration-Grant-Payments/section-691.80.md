##### ยง 691.80 Redetermination of eligibility for a grant award. #####

(a) Change in receipt of Federal Pell Grant. If, after the beginning of an award year, a student otherwise eligible for an ACG or a National SMART Grant begins or ceases to receive a Federal Pell Grant in that award year, the institution must redetermine the student's eligibility for an ACG or a National SMART Grant in that award year.

(b) *Change in enrollment status.* (1) If the student's enrollment status changes from one payment period to another within the same award year, the institution must recalculate the student's award for the new payment period taking into account any changes in the cost of attendance.

(2)(i) If the student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period after the student has begun attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution may (but is not required to) establish a policy under which the student's award for the payment period is recalculated. If such a policy is established, it must apply to all students and be the same as the policy established for the Federal Pell Grant Program.

(ii)(A) If a student's projected enrollment status changes during a payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution must recalculate the student's enrollment status to reflect only those classes for which the student actually began attendance.

(B) If a student's projected enrollment status changes to less-than-half-time during a payment period before the student begins attendance in all of his or her classes for that payment period, the institution must determine that the student is ineligible for a grant for that payment period.
