(a) *Calculation of period of scholarship assistance.* (1) The Secretary calculates the period of time for which a student received scholarship assistance on the basis of information provided by the grantee under § 611.50.

(2) The period for which the recipient received scholarship assistance is the period during which an individual enrolled in the teacher preparation program on a full-time basis, excluding the summer period, would have completed the same course of study.

(b) *Calculation of period needed to teach to meet the service obligation.* (1) The period of the scholarship recipient's service obligation is the period of the individual's receipt of scholarship assistance as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) The Secretary calculates the period that a scholarship recipient must teach in a high-need school of a high-need LEA in order to fulfill his or her service obligation by -

(i) Comparing the period in which the recipient received a scholarship as provided in paragraph (a) of this section with the information provided by the high-need LEA under §§ 611.46 and 611.47 on the period the recipient has taught in one of its high-need schools; and

(ii) Adjusting the period in which the recipient has taught in a high-need school to reflect the individual's employment, if any, as a teacher on a part-time basis relative to classroom teachers the LEA employs on a full-time basis under the LEA's standard yearly contract (excluding any summer or intersession period).

(c) The Secretary adjusts the period of a scholarship recipient's service obligation as provided in paragraph (b) of this section to reflect information the high-need LEA provides under §§ 611.46 and 611.47 that the scholarship recipient also has taught in a high-need school in a summer or intersession period.
