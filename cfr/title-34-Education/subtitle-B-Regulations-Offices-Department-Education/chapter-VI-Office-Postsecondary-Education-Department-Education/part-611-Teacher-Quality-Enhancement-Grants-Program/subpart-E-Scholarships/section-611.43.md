(ii) Be discharged of any repayment obligation as provided in § 611.45.

(2) Unless the service obligation is deferred as provided in § 611.44 or the repayment requirement is discharged, the obligation to repay the amount provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section begins six months after the date the recipient -

(i) Completes the teacher training program without beginning to teach in a high-need school of a high-need LEA; or

(ii) Is no longer enrolled in the teacher training program.

(3) The Secretary determines whether a scholarship recipient has fulfilled the service obligation on the basis of information that the Department receives as provided in §§ 611.46 and 611.47.

(b) *Obligation to Repay: Partial performance of the service obligation.* (1) A scholarship recipient who teaches in a high-need school of a high-need school district for less than the period of his or her service obligation must repay -

(i) The amount of the scholarship that is proportional to the unmet portion of the service obligation;

(ii) Interest that accrues on this portion of the scholarship beginning six months after the recipient's graduation from the teacher preparation program; and

(iii) Costs of collection, if any.

(2) Unless the service obligation is deferred or the repayment requirement is discharged, the obligation to repay the amount provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section begins six months after the date the recipient is no longer employed as a teacher in a high-need school of a high-need LEA.

(c) *Availability of payment schedule.* (1) Upon request to the Secretary, the scholarship recipient may repay the scholarship and accrued interest according to a payment schedule that the Secretary establishes.

(3) Subject to collection action.

(f) *Action by reason of default.* The Secretary may take any action authorized by law to collect the amount of scholarship, accrued interest and collection costs, if any, on which a scholarship recipient obligated to repay under this section has defaulted. This action includes, but is not limited to, filing a lawsuit against the recipient, reporting the default to national credit bureaus, and requesting the Internal Revenue Service to offset the recipient's Federal income tax refund.
