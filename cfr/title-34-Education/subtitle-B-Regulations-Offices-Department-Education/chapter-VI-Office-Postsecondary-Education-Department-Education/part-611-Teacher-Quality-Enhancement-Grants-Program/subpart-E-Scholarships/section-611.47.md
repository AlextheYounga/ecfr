##### ยง 611.47 What are a scholarship recipient's reporting responsibilities upon the close of the LEA's academic year? #####

(a) At the close of the LEA's academic year, a scholarship recipient whose LEA reports under ยง 611.46(a) that he or she is teaching in a high-need school of a high-need LEA must -

(1) Have the LEA provide information to the Department, as the Secretary may require, that confirms the recipient's actual employment status for the preceding period; or

(2) Provide the Department -

(i) A notarized statement that the scholarship recipient has asked the LEA to provide the Department the information identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, including the name and telephone number of the LEA official to whom the request was made; and

(ii) A copy of the information identified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section that the recipient has asked the LEA to provide to the Department.

(b) If the recipient provides the Department the notarized statement and accompanying information identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Department accepts the information provisionally, but the recipient retains an ongoing responsibility for working to have the LEA submit the information directly to the Department.

(c) In subsequent school years, the recipient must have the LEA continue to provide information to the Department on the recipient's employment as the Secretary may require, until the Department notifies the recipient that the service obligation has been fulfilled. The alternative procedures in paragraph (a)(2) of this section also apply in subsequent years.

(d)(1) The Secretary provides a scholarship recipient with credit toward the service obligation for teaching in a high-need school of a high-need LEA during a summer or intersession period (for LEAs that operate year-round programs).

(2) To receive this credit, the recipient must have the LEA at the end of the summer or intersession period provide information to the Department, as the Secretary may require, that confirms that the recipient has taught during this period in a high-need school.
