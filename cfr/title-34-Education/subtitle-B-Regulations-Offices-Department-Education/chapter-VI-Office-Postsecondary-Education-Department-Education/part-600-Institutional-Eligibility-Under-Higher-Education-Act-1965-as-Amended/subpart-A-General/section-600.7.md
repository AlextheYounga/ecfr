(2) *Calculating the number of correspondence students.* For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a student is considered “enrolled in correspondence courses” if the student's enrollment in correspondence courses constituted more than 50 percent of the courses in which the student enrolled during an award year.

(3) *Exceptions.* (i) The provisions contained in paragraphs (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section do not apply to an institution that qualifies as a “technical institute or vocational school used exclusively or principally for the provision of vocational education to individuals who have completed or left high school and who are available for study in preparation for entering the labor market” under section 3(3)(C) of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act of 1995.

(ii) The Secretary waives the limitation contained in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section for an institution that offers a 2-year associate-degree or a 4-year bachelor's-degree program if the students enrolled in the institution's correspondence courses receive no more than 5 percent of the title IV, HEA program funds received by students at that institution.

(c) *Special provisions regarding incarcerated students* - (1) *Exception.* The Secretary may waive the prohibition contained in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section, upon the application of an institution, if the institution is a nonprofit institution that provides four-year or two-year educational programs for which it awards a bachelor's degree, an associate degree, or a postsecondary diploma.

(2) *Waiver for entire institution.* If the nonprofit institution that applies for a waiver consists solely of four-year or two-year educational programs for which it awards a bachelor's degree, an associate degree, or a postsecondary diploma, the Secretary waives the prohibition contained in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section for the entire institution.

(3) *Other waivers.* If the nonprofit institution that applies for a waiver does not consist solely of four-year or two-year educational programs for which it awards a bachelor's degree, an associate degree, or a postsecondary diploma, the Secretary waives the prohibition contained in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section -

(i) For the four-year and two-year programs for which it awards a bachelor's degree, an associate degree or a postsecondary diploma; and

(2) *Number of critical students.* The Secretary grants a waiver under paragraph (d)(1) of this section only if no more than 40 percent of the institution's enrollment of regular students consists of students who -

(i) Count each regular student without regard to the full-time or part-time nature of the student's attendance (i.e., “head count” rather than “full-time equivalent”);

(ii) Count a regular student once regardless of the number of times the student enrolls during an award year; and

(iii) Determine the number of regular students who enrolled in the institution during the relevant award year by -

(A) Calculating the number of regular students who enrolled during that award year; and

(B) Excluding from the number of students in paragraph (e)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, the number of regular students who enrolled but subsequently withdrew or were expelled from the institution and were entitled to receive a 100 percent refund of their tuition and fees less any administrative fee that the institution is permitted to keep under its fair and equitable refund policy.

(ii) Exclude from the number of regular incarcerated students determined in paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the number of those students who enrolled but subsequently withdrew or were expelled from the institution and were entitled to receive a 100 percent refund of their tuition and fees, less any administrative fee the institution is permitted to keep under the institution's fair and equitable refund policy;

(iii) Exclude from the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the number of those regular incarcerated students who remained enrolled in the programs at the end of the applicable award year;

(iv) From the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, determine the number of regular incarcerated students who received a degree, certificate, or other recognized educational credential awarded for successfully completing the program during the applicable award year; and

(v) Divide the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of this section by the total obtained in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section and multiply by 100.

(f)(1) If the Secretary grants a waiver to an institution under this section, the waiver extends indefinitely provided that the institution satisfies the waiver requirements in each award year.

(2) If an institution fails to satisfy the waiver requirements for an award year, the institution becomes ineligible on June 30 of that award year.

(g)(1) For purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and any applicable waiver or exception under this section, the institution shall substantiate the required calculations by having the certified public accountant who prepares its audited financial statement under 34 CFR 668.15 or its title IV, HEA program compliance audit under 34 CFR 668.23 report on the accuracy of those determinations.

(2) The certified public accountant's report must be based on performing an “attestation engagement” in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA's) Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements. The certified public accountant shall include that attestation report with or as part of the audit report referenced in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.

(3) The certified public accountant's attestation report must indicate whether the institution's determinations regarding paragraph (a)(1) of this section and any relevant waiver or exception under paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section are accurate; *i.e.,* fairly presented in all material respects.

(h) *Notice to the Secretary.* An institution shall notify the Secretary -

(1) By July 31 following the end of an award year if it falls within one of the prohibitions contained in paragraph (a)(1)of this section, or fails to continue to satisfy a waiver or exception granted under this section; or

(2) Within 10 days if it falls within one of the prohibitions contained in paragraphs (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section.

(i) Compliance with all eligibility requirements;

(ii) That it did not fall within any of the prohibitions contained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section for at least one award year; and

(iii) That it changed its administrative policies and practices to ensure that it will not fall within any of the prohibitions contained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
