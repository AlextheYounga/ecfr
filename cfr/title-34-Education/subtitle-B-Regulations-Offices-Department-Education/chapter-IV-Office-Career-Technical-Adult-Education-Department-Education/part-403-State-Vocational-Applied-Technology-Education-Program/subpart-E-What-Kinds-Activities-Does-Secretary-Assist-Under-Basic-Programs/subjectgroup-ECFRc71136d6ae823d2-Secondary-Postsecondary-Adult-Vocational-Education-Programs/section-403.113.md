##### § 403.113 How does a State allocate funds under the Secondary School Vocational Education Program to area vocational education schools and intermediate educational agencies? #####

(a) A State shall distribute funds reserved under § 403.112(a) directly to the appropriate area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency in any case in which -

(1) The area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency and an LEA -

(i) Have formed or will form a consortium for the purpose of receiving funds reserved under § 403.112(a); or

(ii) Have entered into or will enter into a cooperative arrangement for the purpose of receiving funds reserved under § 403.112(a); and

(2)(i) The area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency serves a proportion of students with disabilities and students who are economically disadvantaged that is approximately equal to or greater than the proportion of those students attending the secondary schools under the jurisdiction of all of the LEAs sending students to the area vocational education school or the intermediate educational agency; or

(ii) The area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency demonstrates that it is unable to meet the criterion in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section due to the lack of interest by students with disabilities and students who are economically disadvantaged in attending vocational education programs in that area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.

(b) If an area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, then the amount that would otherwise be allocated to the LEA may be distributed to the area vocational education school, the intermediate educational agency, and the LEA -

(1) Based on each school's or entity's relative share of students with disabilities and students who are economically disadvantaged who are attending vocational education programs that meet the requirements of § 403.111 (based, if practicable, on the average enrollment for the prior 3 years); or

(2) On the basis of an agreement between the LEA and the area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and §§ 403.114 and 403.115, prior to distributing funds to any LEA that would receive an allocation that is not sufficient to conduct a program that meets the requirements of § 403.111(c), a State shall encourage the LEA to -

(1) Form a consortium or enter a cooperative agreement with an area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency offering programs that meet the requirements of § 403.111(c), and that are accessible to economically disadvantaged students and students with disabilities that would be served by the LEA; and

(2) Transfer its allocation to an area vocational education school or intermediate educational agency.

(d) If an LEA's allocation under § 403.112 meets the minimum grant requirement in § 403.112(d), and the allocation is distributed in part to an area vocational education school or an intermediate educational agency pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the LEA may retain the amount not distributed to the area vocational education school or an intermediate educational agency even though that amount is less than the minimum grant required by § 403.112(d).
