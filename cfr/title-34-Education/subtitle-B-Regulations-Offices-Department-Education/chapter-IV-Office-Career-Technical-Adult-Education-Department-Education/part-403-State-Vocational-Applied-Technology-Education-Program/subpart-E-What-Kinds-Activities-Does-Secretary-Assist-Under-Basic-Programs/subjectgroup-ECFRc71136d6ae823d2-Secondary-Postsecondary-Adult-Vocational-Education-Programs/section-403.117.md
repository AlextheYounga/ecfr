(a) *Eligible institution* means an institution of higher education, an LEA serving adults, or an area vocational education school serving adults that offers or will offer a program that meets the requirements of § 403.111 and seeks to receive assistance under § 403.116.

(b)(1) *Institution of higher education* means an educational institution in any State that -

(i) Admits as regular students only persons having a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education, or the recognized equivalent of that certificate, or who are beyond the age of compulsory school attendance;

(ii) Is legally authorized within the State to provide a program of education beyond secondary education;

(iii) Provides an educational program for which it awards a bachelor's degree or provides not less than a two-year program which is acceptable for full credit toward such a degree, or in the case of a hospital or health care facility, that provides training of not less than one year for graduates of accredited health professions programs, leading to a degree or certificate upon completion of that training;

(iv) Is a public or other nonprofit institution; and

(v) Is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency or association approved by the Secretary for this purpose or, if not so accredited -

(A) Is an institution with respect to which the Secretary has determined that there is satisfactory assurance, considering the resources available to the institution, the period of time, if any, during which it has operated, the effort it is making to meet accreditation standards, and the purpose for which this determination is being made, that the institution will meet the accreditation standards of such an agency or association within a reasonable time; or

(B) Is an institution whose credits are accepted, on transfer, by not less than three institutions that are so accredited, for credit on the same basis as if transferred from an institution so accredited.

If the Secretary determines that a particular category of these schools does not meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(v) because there is no nationally recognized accrediting agency or association qualified to accredit schools in that category, the Secretary, pending the establishment of such an accrediting agency or association, appoints an advisory committee, composed of persons specially qualified to evaluate training provided by schools in that category, that must -

(i) Prescribe the standards of content, scope, and quality that must be met in order to qualify schools in that category to participate in the program pursuant to this part; and

(ii) Determine whether particular schools not meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this definition meet those standards.
