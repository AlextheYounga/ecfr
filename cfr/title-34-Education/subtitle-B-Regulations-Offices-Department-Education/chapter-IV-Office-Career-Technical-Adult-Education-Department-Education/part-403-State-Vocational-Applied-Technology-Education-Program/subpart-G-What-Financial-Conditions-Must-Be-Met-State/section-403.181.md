##### ยง 403.181 What are the cost-sharing requirements applicable to the basic programs? #####

(a) A State shall match, from non-Federal sources and on a dollar-for-dollar basis, the funds reserved for administration of the State plan under ยง 403.180(b)(4).

(b) The matching requirement under paragraph (a) of this section may be applied overall, rather than line-by-line, to State administrative expenditures.

(c) A State shall provide from non-Federal sources for State administration under the Act an amount that is not less than the amount provided by the State from non-Federal sources for State administrative costs for the preceding fiscal or program year.

Example for paragraph (b):From the five percent reserved for the administration of the State plan, a State must reserve $60,000 to carry out the provisions in ยง 403.13. The $60,000 must be matched, but the matching funds need not be used for the activities described in ยง 403.13.(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 2312(b) and 2468d; H.R. Rep. No. 660, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess. 103-104 (1990))
