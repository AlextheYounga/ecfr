##### ยง 410.24 How does the Secretary award additional grants? #####

If funds remain after providing grants to all eligible institutions, the Secretary makes awards as follows:

(a) The Secretary allocates funds to institutions receiving their first grant under this part in an amount equal to the training equipment costs necessary to implement training programs.

(b) If funds remain after the Secretary makes awards under paragraph (a) of this section, the Secretary reviews training equipment needs at each institution receiving assistance under this part at the end of the five-year period beginning on the first day of the first year for which the institution received a grant under this part, and provides allocations for other training equipment needs if it is demonstrated by the institution that its training equipment has become obsolete for its purposes, or that the development of other training programs is appropriate.
