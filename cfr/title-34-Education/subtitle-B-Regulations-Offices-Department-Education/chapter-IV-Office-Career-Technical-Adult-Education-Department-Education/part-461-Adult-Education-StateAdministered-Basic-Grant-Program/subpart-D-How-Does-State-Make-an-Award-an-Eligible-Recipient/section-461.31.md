(2) A description of cooperative arrangements (including arrangements with business, industry, and volunteer literacy organizations as appropriate) that have been made to deliver services to adults.

(3) Assurances that the adult educational programs, services, or activities that the applicant proposes to provide are coordinated with and do not duplicate programs, services, or activities made available to adults under other Federal, State, and local programs, including the Job Training Partnership Act, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Indian Education Act, the Higher Education Act of 1965, and the Domestic Volunteer Service Act.

(4) The projected goals of the applicant with respect to participant recruitment, retention, and educational achievement and how the applicant will measure and report progress in meeting its goals.

(5) Any other information the SEA considers necessary.

(d) In determining which programs receive assistance, the SEA shall consider -

(2) The degree to which the applicant will coordinate and utilize other literacy and social services available in the community; and

(3) The commitment of the applicant to serve individuals in the community who are most in need of literacy services.

(iii) The availability of day care and transportation services to participants in the project;

(5) Describes proposed programs, activities, and services that address the identified needs;

(6) Describes the resources available to the applicant - other than Federal and State adult education funds - to meet those needs (for example, funds provided under the Job Training Partnership Act, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Indian Education Act, the Higher Education Act of 1965, or the Domestic Volunteer Service Act, and local cash or in-kind contributions); and

(7) Describes project objectives that can be accomplished within the amount of the applicant's budget request.

(f) An SEA may not approve an application for a consortium that includes a for-profit agency, organization or institution unless the State has first determined that -

(2) The public or private nonprofit agency, organization, or institution will enter into a contract with the for-profit agency, organization, or institution for the establishment or expansion of programs.
