##### ยง 461.21 How does the Secretary make reallotments? #####

(a) Any amount of any State's allotment under section 313(b) of the Act that the Secretary determines is not required, for the period the allotment is available, for carrying out that State's plan, is reallotted to other States on dates that the Secretary may fix.

(b) The Secretary determines any amounts to be reallotted on the basis of -

(1) Reports, filed by the States, of the amounts required to carry out their State plans; and

(2) Other information available to the Secretary.

(c) Reallotments are made to other States in proportion to those State's original allotments for the fiscal year in which allotments originally were made, unless the Secretary reduces a State's proportionate share by the amount the Secretary estimates will exceed the sum the State needs and will be able to use under its plan.

(d) The total of any reductions made under paragraph (c) of this section is reallotted among those States whose proportionate shares were not reduced.

(e)(1) Any amount reallotted to a State during a fiscal year is deemed part of the State's allotment for that fiscal year.

(2) A reallotment of funds from one State to another State does not extend the period of time in which the funds must be obligated.
