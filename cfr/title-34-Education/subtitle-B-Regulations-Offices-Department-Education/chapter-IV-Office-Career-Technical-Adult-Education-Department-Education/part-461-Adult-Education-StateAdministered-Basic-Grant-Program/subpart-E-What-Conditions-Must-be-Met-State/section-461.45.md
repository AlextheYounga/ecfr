##### ยง 461.45 How does the Secretary compute maintenance of effort in the event of a waiver? #####

If a State has been granted a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement that allows it to receive a grant from appropriations for a fiscal year, the Secretary determines whether the State has meet that requirement for the grant to be awarded for the year after the year of the waiver by comparing the amount spent for adult education from non-Federal sources in the second preceding fiscal year (or program year) with the amount spent in the fourth preceding fiscal year (or program year.)

Example:Because exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances prevented a State from maintaining effort in fiscal year 1990 (October 1, 1989-September 30, 1990) or in program year 1990 (July 1, 1989-June 30, 1990) at the level of fiscal year 1989 (October 1, 1988-September 30, 1989) or program year 1989 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989), respectively, the Secretary grants the State a waiver of the maintenance of effort requirement that permits the State to receive its fiscal year 1992 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1992 from funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1992 appropriation). In order to determine whether a State has met the maintenance of effort requirement and therefore is eligible to receive its fiscal year 1993 grant (the grant to be awarded for the year after the year of the waiver), the Secretary compares the State's expenditures from the second preceding fiscal year (or program year - fiscal year 1991 (October 1, 1990-September 30, 1991) or program year 1991 (July 1, 1990-June 30, 1991) - with expenditures from the fourth preceding fiscal year - fiscal year 1989 (October 1, 1988-September 30, 1989) or program year 1989 (July 1, 1988-June 30, 1989). If the expenditures from fiscal year (or program year) 1991 are not less than the expenditures from fiscal year (or program year) 1989, the State has maintained effort and is eligible for its fiscal year 1993 grant.(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1209(b)(2))
