##### ยง 461.40 What are the State and local administrative costs requirements? #####

(a)(1) Beginning with the fiscal year 1991 grant (a grant that is awarded on or after July 1, 1991 from funds appropriated in the fiscal year 1991 appropriation), an SEA may use no more than 5 percent of its grant or $50,000 - whichever is greater - for necessary and reasonable State administrative costs.

(2) For grants awarded from funds appropriated for fiscal years prior to fiscal year 1991 (grants awarded before July 1, 1991), an SEA may determine what percent of its grant is necessary and reasonable for State administrative costs.

(b)(1) At least 95 percent of an eligible recipient's award from the SEA must be expended for adult education instructional activities.

(2) The remainder may be used for local administrative costs - noninstructional expenses, including planning, administration, evaluation, personnel development, and coordination - that are necessary and reasonable.

(3) If the administrative cost limits under paragraph (b)(2) of this section are insufficient for adequate planning, administration, evaluation, personnel development, and coordination of programs supported under the Act, the SEA shall negotiate with local grant recipients in order to determine an adequate level of funds to be used for noninstructional purposes.
