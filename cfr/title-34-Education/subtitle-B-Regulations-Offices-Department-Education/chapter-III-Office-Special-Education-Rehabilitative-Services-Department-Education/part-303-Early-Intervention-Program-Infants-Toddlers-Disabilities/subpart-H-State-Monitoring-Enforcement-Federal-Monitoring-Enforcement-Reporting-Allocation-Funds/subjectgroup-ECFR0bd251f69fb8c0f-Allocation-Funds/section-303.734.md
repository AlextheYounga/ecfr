##### § 303.734 Reservation for State incentive grants. #####

(a) *General.* For any fiscal year for which the amount appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 644 of the Act exceeds $460,000,000, the Secretary reserves 15 percent of the appropriated amount exceeding $460,000,000 to provide grants to States that are carrying out the policy described in section 635(c) of the Act and in § 303.211 (including a State that makes part C services available under § 303.211(a)(2)), in order to facilitate the implementation of that policy.

(b) *Amount of grant.* (1) *General.* Notwithstanding section 643(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act, the Secretary provides a grant to each State under this section in an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount reserved under paragraph (a) of this section as the number of infants and toddlers in the State bears to the number of infants and toddlers in all States receiving grants under paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) *Maximum amount.* No State may receive a grant under paragraph (a) of this section for any fiscal year in an amount that is greater than 20 percent of the amount reserved under that paragraph for the fiscal year.

(2) *Second succeeding fiscal year.* Amounts under a grant provided under paragraph (a) of this section that are not obligated and expended prior to the beginning of the second fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year for which those amounts were appropriated must be returned to the Secretary and used to make grants to States under section 633 of the Act (from their allotments identified in §§ 303.731 through 303.733) during the second succeeding fiscal year.
