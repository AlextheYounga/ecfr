##### § 366.29 When may the Director of the designated State unit (DSU) award grants to centers? #####

(a) The Director of the DSU (Director) may award grants under section 723 of the Act and this subpart to centers located within the State or in a bordering State in a fiscal year if -

(1) The Director submits to the Secretary and obtains approval of an application to award grants for that fiscal year under section 723 of the Act and § 366.32 (a) and (b); and

(2) The Secretary determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by the State to support the general operation of centers meeting the requirements of part C of chapter 1 of title VII of the Act in the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the application is submitted equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State under section 721 (c) and (d) of the Act (or part B of title VII of the Act as in effect on October 28, 1992) for that preceding fiscal year.

(b) For purposes of section 723(a)(1)(A)(iii) of the Act and this subpart, the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program is considered the “preceding fiscal year.” *Example:* If FY 1995 is the fiscal year for which the State submits an application to administer the CIL program under this subpart, FY 1993 is the “preceding fiscal year.” In determining the “preceding fiscal year” under this subpart, the Secretary makes any adjustments necessary to accommodate a State's multi-year funding cycle or fiscal year that does not coincide with the Federal fiscal year.
