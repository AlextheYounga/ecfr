##### ยง 29.1 Purpose and scope. #####

(a) *Purpose of this part.* This part implements sections 211 through 215 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) through the establishment of uniform procedures for the receipt, care, and storage of Critical Infrastructure Information (CII) voluntarily submitted to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Title II, Subtitle B, of the Homeland Security Act is referred to herein as the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 (CII Act). Consistent with the statutory mission of DHS to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States and reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism, DHS will encourage the voluntary submission of CII by safeguarding and protecting that information from unauthorized disclosure and by ensuring that such information is, as necessary, securely shared with State and local government pursuant to section 214(a) through (g) of the CII Act. As required by the CII Act, these rules establish procedures regarding:

(1) The acknowledgement of receipt by DHS of voluntarily submitted CII;

(2) The receipt, validation, handling, storage, proper marking and use of information as PCII;

(3) The safeguarding and maintenance of the confidentiality of such information, appropriate sharing of such information with State and local governments pursuant to section 214(a) through (g) of the HSA.

(4) The issuance of advisories, notices and warnings related to the protection of critical infrastructure or protected systems in such a manner as to protect from unauthorized disclosure the source of critical infrastructure information that forms the basis of the warning, and any information that is proprietary or business sensitive, might be used to identify the submitting person or entity, or is otherwise not appropriately in the public domain.

(b) *Scope.* The regulations in this part apply to all persons and entities that are authorized to handle, use, or store PCII or that otherwise accept receipt of PCII.
