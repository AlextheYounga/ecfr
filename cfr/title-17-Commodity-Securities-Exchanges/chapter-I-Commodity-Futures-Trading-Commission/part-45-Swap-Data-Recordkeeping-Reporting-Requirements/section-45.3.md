Registered entities and swap counterparties must report required swap creation data electronically to a swap data repository as set forth in this section and in the manner provided in § 45.13(b). The rules governing acceptance and recording of such data by a swap data repository are set forth in § 49.10 of this chapter. The reporting obligations of swap counterparties with respect to swaps executed prior to the applicable compliance date and in existence on or after July 21, 2010, the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, are set forth in part 46 of this chapter. This section and § 45.4 establish the general swap data reporting obligations of swap dealers, major swap participants, non-SD/MSP counterparties, swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, and derivatives clearing organizations to report swap data to a swap data repository. In addition to the reporting obligations set forth in this section and in § 45.4, registered entities and swap counterparties are subject to other reporting obligations set forth in this chapter, including, without limitation, the following: Swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are also subject to the reporting obligations with respect to corporate affiliations reporting set forth in § 45.6; swap execution facilities, designated contract markets, swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are subject to the reporting obligations with respect to real time reporting of swap data set forth in part 43 of this chapter; counterparties to a swap for which an exception to, or an exemption from, the clearing requirement has been elected under part 50 of this chapter are subject to the reporting obligations set forth in part 50 of this chapter; and, where applicable, swap dealers, major swap participants, and non-SD/MSP counterparties are subject to the reporting obligations with respect to large traders set forth in parts 17 and 18 of this chapter. Paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply to all swaps except clearing swaps, while paragraph (e) applies only to clearing swaps.
