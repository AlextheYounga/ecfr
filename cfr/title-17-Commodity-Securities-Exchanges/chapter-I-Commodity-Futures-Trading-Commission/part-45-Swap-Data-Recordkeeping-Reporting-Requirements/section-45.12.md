##### § 45.12 Voluntary supplemental reporting #####

(a) For purposes of this section, the term *voluntary, supplemental report* means any report of swap data to a swap data repository that is not required to be made pursuant to this part or any other part in this chapter.

(b) A voluntary, supplemental report may be made only by a counterparty to the swap in connection with which the voluntary, supplemental report is made, or by a third-party service provider acting on behalf of a counterparty to the swap.

(c) A voluntary, supplemental report may be made either to the swap data repository to which all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data is reported for the swap pursuant to §§ 45.3 and 45.10, or to a different swap data repository.

(d) A voluntary, supplemental report must contain:

(1) An indication that the report is a voluntary, supplemental report.

(2) The unique swap identifier created pursuant to §§ 45.5 and 45.9. Therefore, no voluntary, supplemental report may be made until after the unique swap identifier has been created pursuant to §§ 45.5 and 45.9 and has been transmitted to the counterparty making the voluntary, supplemental report.

(3) The identity of the swap data repository to which all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data is reported for the swap pursuant to §§ 45.3 and 45.10, if the voluntary supplemental report is made to a different swap data repository.

(4) The legal entity identifier (or substitute identifier) required by § 45.6 for the counterparty making the voluntary, supplemental report.

(5) If applicable, an indication that the voluntary, supplemental report is made pursuant to the laws or regulations of any jurisdiction outside the United States.

(e) If a counterparty that has made a voluntary, supplemental report discovers any errors in the swap data included in the voluntary, supplemental report, the counterparty must report a correction of each such error to the swap data repository to which the voluntary, supplemental report was made, as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of any such error.
