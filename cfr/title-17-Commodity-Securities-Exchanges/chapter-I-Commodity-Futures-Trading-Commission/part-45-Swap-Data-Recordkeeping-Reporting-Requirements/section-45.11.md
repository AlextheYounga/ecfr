##### ยง 45.11 Data reporting for swaps in a swap asset class not accepted by any swap data repository. #####

(a) Should there be a swap asset class for which no swap data repository registered with the Commission currently accepts swap data, each registered entity or counterparty required by this part to report any required swap creation data or required swap continuation data with respect to a swap in that asset class must report that same data to the Commission.

(b) Data reported to the Commission pursuant to this section shall be reported at times announced by the Commission and in an electronic file in a format acceptable to the Commission.

(c) Delegation of authority to the Chief Information Officer: The Commission hereby delegates to its Chief Information Officer, until the Commission orders otherwise, the authority set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, to be exercised by the Chief Information Officer or by such other employee or employees of the Commission as may be designated from time to time by the Chief Information Officer. The Chief Information Officer may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this paragraph.

(1) The authority to determine the manner, format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission standards and procedures acceptable to the Commission for the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(2) The authority to determine whether the Commission may permit or require use by reporting entities or counterparties in reporting pursuant to this section of one or more particular data standards (such as FIX, FpML, ISO 20022, or some other standard), in order to accommodate the needs of different communities of users.

(3) The dates and times at which required swap creation data or required swap continuation data shall be reported pursuant to this section.
