(b) *Data reported to swap data repositories.* In reporting swap data to a swap data repository as required by this part, each reporting entity or counterparty shall use the facilities, methods, or data standards provided or required by the swap data repository to which the entity or counterparty reports the data. A swap data repository may permit reporting entities and counterparties to use various facilities, methods, or data standards, provided that its requirements in this regard enable it to meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to maintenance and transmission of swap data.

The Chief Information Officer may submit to the Commission for its consideration any matter which has been delegated in this paragraph (c). Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the Commission, at its election, from exercising the authority delegated in this paragraph. The authority delegated to the Chief Information Officer by this paragraph (c) shall include:

(1) The authority to determine the manner, format, coding structure, and electronic data transmission standards and procedures acceptable to the Commission for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.

(2) The authority to determine whether the Commission may permit or require use by reporting entities or counterparties, or by swap data repositories, of one or more particular data standards (such as FIX, FpML, ISO 20022, or some other standard), in order to accommodate the needs of different communities of users, or to enable swap data repositories to comply with paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) The Chief Information Officer shall publish from time to time in the Federal Register and on the Web site of the Commission the format, data schema, and electronic data transmission methods and procedures acceptable to the Commission.
