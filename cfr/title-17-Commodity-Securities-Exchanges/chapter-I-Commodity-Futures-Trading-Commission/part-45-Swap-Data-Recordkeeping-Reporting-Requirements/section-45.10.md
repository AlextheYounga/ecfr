Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 75564, Nov. 25, 2020.

All swap data for a given swap, which shall include all swap data required to be reported pursuant to parts 43 and 45 of this chapter, must be reported to a single swap data repository, which shall be the swap data repository to which the first report of required swap creation data is made pursuant to this part.

(a) *Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market.* To ensure that all swap data, including all swap data required to be reported pursuant to parts 43 and 45 of this chapter, for a swap executed on or pursuant to the rules of a swap execution facility or designated contract market is reported to a single swap data repository:

(1) The swap execution facility or designated contract market that reports required swap creation data as required by § 45.3 shall report all such data to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after execution, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit to both counterparties to the swap, and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, that will clear the swap, both:

(i) The identity of the swap data repository to which required swap creation data is reported by the swap execution facility or designated contract market; and

(ii) The unique swap identifier for the swap, created pursuant to § 45.5.

(2) Thereafter, all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data reported for the swap reported by any registered entity or counterparty shall be reported to that same swap data repository (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).

(b) *Off-facility swaps with a swap dealer or major swap participant reporting counterparty.* To ensure that all swap data, including all swap data required to be reported pursuant to parts 43 and 45 of this chapter, for off-facility swaps with a swap dealer or major swap participant reporting counterparty is reported to a single swap data repository:

(1) If the reporting counterparty reports primary economic terms data to a swap data repository as required by § 45.3:

(i) The reporting counterparty shall report primary economic terms data to a single swap data repository.

(ii) As soon as technologically practicable after execution, but no later than as required pursuant to § 45.3, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the other counterparty to the swap both the identity of the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data is reported by the reporting counterparty, and the unique swap identifier for the swap created pursuant to § 45.5.

(iii) If the swap will be cleared, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the derivatives clearing organization at the time the swap is submitted for clearing both the identity of the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data is reported by the reporting counterparty, and the unique swap identifier for the swap created pursuant to § 45.5.

(2) Thereafter, all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data reported for the swap, by any registered entity or counterparty, shall be reported to the swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).

(c) *Off-facility swaps with a non-SD/MSP reporting counterparty.* To ensure that all swap data, including all swap data required to be reported pursuant to parts 43 and 45 of this chapter, for such swaps is reported to a single swap data repository:

(1) If the reporting counterparty reports primary economic terms data to a swap data repository as required by § 45.3:

(i) The reporting counterparty shall report primary economic terms data to a single swap data repository.

(ii) As soon as technologically practicable after execution, but no later than as required pursuant to § 45.3, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the other counterparty to the swap the identity of the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data was reported by the reporting counterparty.

(iii) If the swap will be cleared, the reporting counterparty shall transmit to the derivatives clearing organization at the time the swap is submitted for clearing the identity of the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data was reported by the reporting counterparty.

(2) The swap data repository to which the swap is reported as provided in paragraph (c) of this section shall transmit the unique swap identifier created pursuant to § 45.5 to both counterparties and to the derivatives clearing organization, if any, as soon as technologically practicable after creation of the unique swap identifier.

(3) Thereafter, all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data reported for the swap, by any registered entity or counterparty, shall be reported to the swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).

(d) *Clearing swaps.* To ensure that all swap data for a given clearing swap, and for clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap or that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, is reported to a single swap data repository:

(1) The derivatives clearing organization that is a counterparty to such clearing swap shall report all required swap creation data for that clearing swap to a single swap data repository. As soon as technologically practicable after acceptance of an original swap by a derivatives clearing organization for clearing or execution of a clearing swap that does not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall transmit to the counterparty to each clearing swap the legal entity identifier of the swap data repository to which the derivatives clearing organization reported the required swap creation data for that clearing swap.

(2) Thereafter, all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data reported for that clearing swap shall be reported by the derivatives clearing organization to the swap data repository to which swap data has been reported pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section (or to its successor in the event that it ceases to operate, as provided in part 49 of this chapter).

(3) For clearing swaps that replace a particular original swap, and for equal and opposite clearing swaps that are created upon execution of the same transaction and that do not replace an original swap, the derivatives clearing organization shall report all required swap creation data and all required swap continuation data for such clearing swaps to a single swap data repository.
