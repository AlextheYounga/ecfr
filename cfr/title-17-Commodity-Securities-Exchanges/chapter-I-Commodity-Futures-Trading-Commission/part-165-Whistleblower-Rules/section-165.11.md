(1) The Department of Justice;

(2) An appropriate department or agency of the Federal Government, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction;

(3) A registered entity, registered futures association, or self-regulatory organization;

(4) A State criminal or appropriate civil agency, acting within the scope of its jurisdiction; or

(5) A foreign futures authority; and
