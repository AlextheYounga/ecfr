(a) *Eligible affiliate counterparty status.* Subject to the conditions in paragraph (b) of this section:

(1) Counterparties to a swap may elect not to clear a swap subject to the clearing requirement of section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Act and this part if:

(i) One counterparty, directly or indirectly, holds a majority ownership interest in the other counterparty, and the counterparty that holds the majority interest in the other counterparty reports its financial statements on a consolidated basis under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, and such consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the majority-owned counterparty; or

(ii) A third party, directly or indirectly, holds a majority ownership interest in both counterparties, and the third party reports its financial statements on a consolidated basis under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or International Financial Reporting Standards, and such consolidated financial statements include the financial results of both of the swap counterparties.

(2) For purposes of this section:

(i) A counterparty or third party directly or indirectly holds a majority ownership interest if it directly or indirectly holds a majority of the equity securities of an entity, or the right to receive upon dissolution, or the contribution of, a majority of the capital of a partnership; and

(ii) The term “eligible affiliate counterparty” means an entity that meets the requirements of this paragraph.

(b) *Additional conditions.* Eligible affiliate counterparties to a swap may elect the exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section if:

(1) Both counterparties elect not to clear the swap;

(2)(i) A swap dealer or major swap participant that is an eligible affiliate counterparty to the swap satisfies the requirements of § 23.504 of this chapter; or

(3) The swap is subject to a centralized risk management program that is reasonably designed to monitor and manage the risks associated with the swap. If at least one of the eligible affiliate counterparties is a swap dealer or major swap participant, this centralized risk management requirement shall be satisfied by complying with the requirements of § 23.600 of this chapter; and

(4)(i) Each eligible affiliate counterparty that enters into a swap, which is included in a class of swaps identified in § 50.4, with an unaffiliated counterparty shall:

(A) Comply with the requirements for clearing the swap in section 2(h) of the Act and this part;

(C) Comply with an exception or exemption under section 2(h)(7) of the Act or this part;

(D) Comply with an exception or exemption under a foreign jurisdiction's clearing mandate, provided that:

(*1*) The foreign jurisdiction's clearing mandate is comparable, and comprehensive but not necessarily identical, to the clearing requirement of section 2(h) of the Act and this part, as determined by the Commission; and

(*2*) The foreign jurisdiction's exception or exemption is comparable to an exception or exemption under section 2(h)(7) of the Act or this part, as determined by the Commission; or

(E) Clear such swap through a registered derivatives clearing organization or a clearing organization that is subject to supervision by appropriate government authorities in the home country of the clearing organization and has been assessed to be in compliance with the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.

(ii)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section, if one of the eligible affiliate counterparties is located in the European Union, Japan, or Singapore, the following may satisfy the requirements of paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section until March 11, 2014:

(A) Each eligible affiliate counterparty, or a third party that directly or indirectly holds a majority interest in both eligible affiliate counterparties, pays and collects full variation margin daily on all swaps entered into between the eligible affiliate counterparties located in jurisdictions other than the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore and an unaffiliated counterparty; or

(i) The relevant SEC Central Index Key number for that counterparty; and

(ii) Acknowledgment that an appropriate committee of the board of directors (or equivalent body) of the eligible affiliate counterparty has reviewed and approved the decision to enter into swaps that are exempt from the requirements of section 2(h)(1) and 2(h)(8) of the Act.

(d) *Annual reporting.* An eligible affiliate counterparty that qualifies for the exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section may report the information listed in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section annually in anticipation of electing the exemption for one or more swaps. Any such reporting by a reporting counterparty under this paragraph will be effective for purposes of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section for 365 days following the date of such reporting. During the 365-day period, the reporting counterparty shall amend the report as necessary to reflect any material changes to the information reported. Each reporting counterparty shall have a reasonable basis to believe that the eligible affiliate counterparties meet the requirements for the exemption under this section.
