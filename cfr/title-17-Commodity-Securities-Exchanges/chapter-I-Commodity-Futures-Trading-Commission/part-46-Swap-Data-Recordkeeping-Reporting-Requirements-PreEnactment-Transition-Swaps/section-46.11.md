Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 75594, Nov. 25, 2020.

(a) Each swap counterparty required by this part 46 to report swap data shall report any errors and omissions in the data so reported. Corrections of errors or omissions shall be reported as soon as technologically practicable after discovery of any such error or omission.

(b) For pre-enactment or transition swaps for which this part requires reporting of continuation data, reporting counterparties reporting state data as provided in part 45 of this chapter may fulfill the requirement to report errors or omissions by making appropriate corrections in their next daily report of state data pursuant to part 45 of this chapter.

(c) Each counterparty to a pre-enactment or transition swap that is not the reporting counterparty as determined pursuant to ยง 46.5, and that discovers any error or omission with respect to any swap data reported to a swap data repository for that swap, shall promptly notify the reporting counterparty of each such error or omission. As soon as technologically practicable after receiving such notice, the reporting counterparty shall report a correction of each such error or omission to the swap data repository.

(d) Each swap counterparty reporting corrections to errors or omissions in data previously reported as required by this part shall report such corrections in the same format as it reported the erroneous or omitted data.
