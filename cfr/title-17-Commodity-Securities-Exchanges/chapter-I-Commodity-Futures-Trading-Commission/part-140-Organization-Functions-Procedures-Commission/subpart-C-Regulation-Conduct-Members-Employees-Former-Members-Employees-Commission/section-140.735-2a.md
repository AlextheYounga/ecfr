##### § 140.735-2a Prohibited interests. #####

(a) *Application.* This section applies to all financial interests of a Commission member or employee of the Commission, including financial interests held by the member or employee for the account of other persons. A member or employee shall be deemed to have a sufficient interest in the financial interests of his or her spouse, minor child, or other relative who is a resident of the immediate household of the member or employee, so that such financial interests must be reported and are subject to all the terms of this section.

(b) *Prohibitions.* Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, no member or employee of the Commission shall:

(1) Have a financial interest, through ownership of securities or otherwise, in any person 5 registered with the Commission (including futures commission merchants, associated persons and agents of futures commission merchants, floor brokers, commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators, and any other persons required to be registered in a fashion similar to any of the above under the Commodity Exchange Act or pursuant to any rule or regulation promulgated by the Commission), or any contract market, swap execution facility, swap data repository, board of trade, or other trading facility, or any derivatives clearing organization subject to regulation or oversight by the Commission; 6

5 As defined in section 1a(38) of the Commodity Exchange Act and 17 CFR 1.3(u) thereunder, a “person” includes an individual, association, partnership, corporation and a trust.

6 Attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 208.

7 [Reserved]

(c) *Exceptions.* The prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply to:

(1) A financial interest in any publicly-available pooled investment vehicle (such as a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund) other than one operated by a person who is a commodity pool operator with respect to such entity if such vehicle does not have invested, or indicate in its prospectus the intent to invest, ten percent or more of its assets in securities of persons described in paragraph (b) of this section and the member or employee neither exercises control nor has the ability to exercise control over the financial interests held in such vehicle;

(2) A financial interest in any corporate parent or affiliate of a person described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the operations of such person provide less than ten percent of the gross revenues of the corporate parent or affiliate; 8

8 It is the member's or employee's responsibility to monitor his or her financial interests and those of a spouse or minor child or other related member of his or her immediate household, to promptly report relevant changes to the General Counsel in writing, and to seek the advice of the General Counsel as to what action may be appropriate. In this regard, attention is directed to 18 U.S.C. 208, which bars an employee from participating in any particular matter that will have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest in question.

(3) A financial interest in any trust or estate of which the member or employee is solely a beneficiary, has no power to control, and does not in fact control or advise with respect to the investments of the trust or estate; except that such interest is subject to the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (f) of this section.

(d) *Retention or passive acquisition of prohibited financial interests.* Nothing in this section shall prohibit a member or employee, or a spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of the member or employee, from:

(1) Retaining a financial interest that was permitted to be retained by the member or employee prior to the adoption of this regulation, was obtained prior to the commencement of employment with the Commission, or was acquired by a spouse prior to marriage to the member or employee; or

(2) Acquiring, retaining, or controlling an otherwise prohibited financial interest, including but not limited to any security or option on a security (but not a security futures product), where the financial interest was acquired by inheritance, gift, stock split, involuntary stock dividend, merger, acquisition, or other change in corporate ownership, exercise of preemptive right, or otherwise without specific intent to acquire the financial interest, or by a spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of the member or employee as part of an employment compensation package; *provided, however,* that retention of any interest allowed by paragraph (c)(3) or (d) of this section is permitted only where the employee:

(i) Makes full disclosure of any such interest on his or her annual financial disclosure (Standard Form 278 or Standard Form 450);

(ii) Makes full written disclosure to the General Counsel within 30 days of commencing employment or, for incumbents, within twenty days of his or her receipt of actual or constructive notice that the interest has been acquired; 9 and

9 Changes in holdings, other than by purchase, which do not affect disqualification, such as those resulting from the automatic reinvestment of dividends, stock splits, stock dividends or reclassifications, may be reported on the annual statement, SF 278 or SF 450, rather than when notification of the transaction is received. Acquisition by, for example, gifts, inheritance, or spinoffs, which may result in additional disqualifications pursuant to paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section and 18 U.S.C. 208 shall be reported to the General Counsel within 20 days of the receipt of actual or constructive notice thereof.

(iii) Will be disqualified in accordance with 5 CFR part 2635, subpart D, and 18 U.S.C. 208 from participating in any particular matter that will have a direct and predictable effect on the financial interest in question. Any Commission member or employee affected by this section may, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) and 5 CFR 2640.301-303, request a waiver of the disqualification requirement.

Note:

With respect to any financial interest retained under paragraph (c)(3) or (d) of this section, Commission members and employees are reminded of their obligations under 18 U.S.C. 208 and 5 CFR part 2635, subpart D, to disqualify themselves from participating in any particular matter in which they, their spouses or minor children have a financial interest.

(e) *Exception applicable to legally separated employees.* This section shall not apply to the financial interests of a legally separated spouse of a Commission member or employee, including transactions for the benefit of a minor child, if the member or employee has no power to control and does not, in fact, advise or control with respect to such transactions. If the member or employee has actual or constructive knowledge of such financial interests held by a legally separated spouse or for the benefit of a minor child, the disqualification provisions of paragraphs (d)(2)(i)-(iii) of this section and 18 U.S.C. 208 are applicable.

(f) *Divestiture.* Based upon a determination of substantial conflict under 5 CFR 2635.403(b) and 18 U.S.C. 208, the Commission, or its designee, may require in writing that a member or employee, or the spouse or minor child or other related member of the immediate household of a member or employee, divest a financial interest that he or she is otherwise authorized to retain under this section. 10

10 Any evidence of a violation of 18 U.S.C. 208 must be reported by the General Counsel to the Commission, which may refer the matter to the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney in whose venue the violations lie. *See* 28 U.S.C. 535.
