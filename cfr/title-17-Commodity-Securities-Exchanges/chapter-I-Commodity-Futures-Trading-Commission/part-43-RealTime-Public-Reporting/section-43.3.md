Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties prior to the execution of the publicly reportable swap transaction, the following persons shall be reporting parties for off-facility swaps:

(i) If only one party is a swap dealer or major swap participant, then the swap dealer or major swap participant shall be the reporting party;

(ii) If one party is a swap dealer and the other party is a major swap participant, then the swap dealer shall be the reporting party;

(2) *Public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data by registered swap data repositories.* A registered swap data repository shall ensure that swap transaction and pricing data is publicly disseminated, as soon as technologically practicable after such data is received from a registered swap execution facility, designated contract market or reporting party, unless such publicly reportable swap transaction is subject to a time delay described in ยง 43.5 of this part, in which case the publicly reportable swap transaction shall be publicly disseminated in the manner described in ยง 43.5.

(3) *Prohibitions on disclosure of data.* (i) If there is a registered swap data repository for an asset class, a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of such data by a registered swap data repository unless:

(B) Such disclosure is only made to market participants on such registered swap execution facility or designated contract market;

(C) Market participants are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and

(D) Any such disclosure by the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market is non-discriminatory.

(ii) If there is a registered swap data repository for an asset class, a swap dealer or major swap participant shall not disclose swap transaction and pricing data relating to publicly reportable swap transactions in such asset class, prior to the public dissemination of such data by a registered swap data repository unless:

(A) Such disclosure is made no earlier than the transmittal of such data to a registered swap data repository for public dissemination;

(B) Such disclosure is only made to the customer base of such swap dealer or major swap participant, including parties who maintain accounts with or have been swap counterparties with such swap dealer or major swap participant;

(C) Swap counterparties are provided advance notice of such disclosure; and

(c) *Requirements for registered swap data repositories in providing the public dissemination of swap transaction and pricing data in real-time* - (1) *Compliance with 17 CFR part 49.* Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall comply with part 49 of this chapter and shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in accordance with this part as soon as technologically practicable upon receipt of such data, except as otherwise provided in this part.

(2) *Acceptance and public dissemination of all swaps in an asset class.* Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for swaps in its selected asset class shall accept and publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time for all publicly reportable swap transactions within such asset class, unless otherwise prescribed by the Commission.

(3) *Annual independent review.* Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall perform, on an annual basis, an independent review in accordance with established audit procedures and standards of the registered swap data repository's security and other system controls for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the requirements in this part.

(d) *Availability of swap transaction and pricing data to the public.* (1) Registered swap data repositories shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in a consistent, usable and machine-readable electronic format that allows the data to be downloaded, saved and analyzed.

(2) Data that is publicly disseminated pursuant to this part shall be available from an Internet Web site in a format that is freely available and readily accessible to the public.

(3) Registered swap data repositories shall provide to the Commission a hyperlink to the Internet Web site where publicly disseminated swap transaction and pricing data can be accessed by the public.

(e) *Errors or omissions* - (1) *In general.* Any errors or omissions in swap transaction and pricing data that were publicly disseminated in real-time shall be corrected or cancelled in the following manner:

(iii) If the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market becomes aware of an error or omission in the swap transaction or pricing data reported with respect to such swap, or receives notification from the reporting party, the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall promptly submit corrected data to the same registered swap data repository.

(iv) Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall publicly disseminate any cancellations or corrections to such data, as soon as technologically practicable after receipt or discovery of any such cancellation or correction.

(2) *Improper cancellation or correction.* Reporting parties, registered swap execution facilities, designated contract markets and registered swap data repositories shall not submit or agree to submit a cancellation or correction for the purpose of re-reporting swap transaction and pricing data in order to gain or extend a delay in public dissemination of accurate swap transaction or pricing data or to otherwise evade the reporting requirements in this part.
