##### ยง 49.4 Withdrawal from registration. #####

(a)(1) A registered swap data repository may withdraw its registration by giving notice in writing to the Commission requesting that its registration as a swap data repository be withdrawn, which notice shall be served at least sixty days prior to the date named therein as the date when the withdrawal of registration shall take effect. The request to withdraw shall be made by a person duly authorized by the registrant and shall specify:

(i) The name of the registrant for which withdrawal of registration is being requested;

(ii) The name, address and telephone number of the swap data repository that will have custody of data and records of the registrant;

(iii) The address where such data and records will be located; and

(iv) A statement that the custodial swap data repository is authorized to make such data and records available in accordance with ยง 1.44.

(2) Prior to filing a request to withdraw, a registered swap data repository shall file an amended Form SDR to update any inaccurate information. A withdrawal of registration shall not affect any action taken or to be taken by the Commission based upon actions, activities or events occurring during the time that the facility was designated by the Commission.

(b) A notice of withdrawal from registration filed by a swap data repository shall become effective for all matters (except as provided in this paragraph (b)) on the 60th day after the filing thereof with the Commission, within such longer period of time as to which such swap data repository consents or which the Commission, by order, may determine as necessary or appropriate in the public interest.

(c) *Revocation of Registration for False Application.* If, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that any registered swap data repository has obtained its registration by making any false or misleading statements with respect to any material fact or has violated or failed to comply with any provision of the Act and regulations thereunder, the Commission, by order, may revoke the registration. Pending final determination whether any registration shall be revoked, the Commission, by order, may suspend such registration, if such suspension appears to the Commission, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to be necessary or appropriate and in the public interest.
