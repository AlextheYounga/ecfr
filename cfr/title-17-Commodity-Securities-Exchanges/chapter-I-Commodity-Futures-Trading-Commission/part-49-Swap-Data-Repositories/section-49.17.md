An Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator that has executed a confidentiality arrangement with the Commission pursuant to § 49.18(a) and provided such confidentiality arrangement to one or more swap data repositories shall notify the Commission and each such swap data repository of any change to such Appropriate Domestic Regulator's or Appropriate Foreign Regulator's scope of jurisdiction as described in such confidentiality arrangement.

(3) If the Commission determines that an applicant pursuant to this paragraph is, conditionally or unconditionally, appropriate for purposes of CEA section 21(c)(7), the Commission shall issue an order setting forth its appropriateness determination. The Commission shall not determine that an applicant pursuant to this paragraph is appropriate unless the Commission is satisfied that -

(i) The applicant employs appropriate confidentiality safeguards to ensure that any swap data such applicant receives from a registered swap data repository will not be disclosed, except as allowed for in the form of confidentiality arrangement set forth in appendix B to this part 49 or, in the Commission's discretion as set forth in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, in a different form, provided that such confidentiality arrangement contains the elements required in § 49.18(b), and
