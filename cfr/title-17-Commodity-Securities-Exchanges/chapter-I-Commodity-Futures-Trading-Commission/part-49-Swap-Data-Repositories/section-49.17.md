(1) *Appropriate Domestic Regulator.* The term “*Appropriate Domestic Regulator”* shall mean:

(i) *Filing requirements.* For those Foreign Regulators who do not currently have a memorandum of understanding with the Commission, the Commission has determined to provide the following filing process for those Foreign Regulators that may require swap data or information maintained by a registered swap data repository. The filing requirement set forth in this § 49.17 will assist the Commission in its analysis of whether a specific Foreign Regulator should be considered “appropriate” for purposes of Section 21(c)(7) of the Act.

(A) The Foreign Regulator is required to file an application in the form and manner prescribed by the Commission.

(B) The Foreign Regulator in its application is required to provide sufficient facts and procedures to permit the Commission to analyze whether the Foreign Regulator employs appropriate confidentiality procedures and to satisfy itself that the information will be disclosed only as permitted by Section 8(e) of the Act.

(ii) The Commission in its analysis of Foreign Regulator applications shall be satisfied that any information potentially provided by a registered swap data repository will not be disclosed except in limited circumstances, such as an adjudicatory action or proceeding involving the Foreign Regulator, as identified in Section 8 of the Act.

(iii) The Commission reserves the right in connection with any determination of an “Appropriate Foreign Regulator” to revisit or reassess a prior determination consistent with the Act.

(3) *Direct electronic access.* For the purposes of this regulation, the term “direct electronic access” shall mean an electronic system, platform or framework that provides Internet or Web-based access to real-time swap transaction data and also provides scheduled data transfers to Commission electronic systems.

(c) *Commission access* - (1) *Direct electronic access.* A registered swap data repository shall provide direct electronic access to the Commission or the Commission's designee, including another registered entity, in order for the Commission to carry out its legal and statutory responsibilities under the Act and related regulations.

(2) *Monitoring tools.* A registered swap data repository is required to provide the Commission with proper tools for the monitoring, screening and analyzing of swap transaction data, including, but not limited to, Web-based services, services that provide automated transfer of data to Commission systems, various software and access to the staff of the swap data repository and/or third-party service providers or agents familiar with the operations of the registered swap data repository, which can provide assistance to the Commission regarding data structure and content. These monitoring tools shall be substantially similar in analytical capability as those provided to the compliance staff and the Chief Compliance Officer of the swap data repository.

(3) *Authorized users.* The swap transaction data provided to the Commission by a registered swap data repository shall be accessible only by authorized users. The swap data repository shall maintain and provide a list of authorized users in the manner and frequency determined by the Commission.

(d) *Other regulators* - (1) *General Procedure for Gaining Access to Registered Swap Data Repository Data.* Appropriate Domestic Regulators and Appropriate Foreign Regulators seeking to gain access to the swap data maintained by a swap data repository are required to apply for access by filing a request for access with the registered swap data repository and certifying that it is acting within the scope of its jurisdiction.

(2) *Appropriate domestic regulator with regulatory responsibility over a swap data repository.* An Appropriate Domestic Regulator that has regulatory jurisdiction over a swap data repository registered with it pursuant to a separate statutory authority that is also registered with the Commission pursuant to this chapter is not subject to this paragraph (d) and § 49.18(b) as long as the following conditions are met:

(4) *Obligations of the registered swap data repository in connection with appropriate domestic regulator or appropriate foreign regulator requests for data access.*

(i) A registered swap data repository shall promptly notify the Commission regarding any request received by an Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator to gain access to the swaps transaction data maintained by such swap data repository.

(ii) The registered swap data repository shall notify the Commission electronically in a format specified by the Secretary of the Commission.

(5) *Timing.* Once the swap data repository provides the Commission with notification of a request for data access by an Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator as required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section, such swap data repository shall provide access to the requested swap data.

(6) *Confidentiality and indemnification agreement.* Consistent with § 49.18 of this part, the Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator prior to receipt of any requested data or information shall execute a “Confidentiality and Indemnification Agreement” with the registered swap data repository as set forth in Section 21(d) of the Act.
