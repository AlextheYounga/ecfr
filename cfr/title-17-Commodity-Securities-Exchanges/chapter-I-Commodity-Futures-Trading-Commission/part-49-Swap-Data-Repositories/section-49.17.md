Each registered swap data repository shall maintain records thereafter, pursuant to § 49.12, of the details of such initial request and of all subsequent requests by such Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator for such access.

An Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator that has executed a confidentiality arrangement with the Commission pursuant to § 49.18(a) and provided such confidentiality arrangement to one or more swap data repositories shall notify the Commission and each such swap data repository of any change to such Appropriate Domestic Regulator's or Appropriate Foreign Regulator's scope of jurisdiction as described in such confidentiality arrangement. The Commission may direct a swap data repository to suspend, limit, or revoke access to swap data maintained by such swap data repository based on any such change to such Appropriate Domestic Regulator's or Appropriate Foreign Regulator's scope of jurisdiction, and, if so directed in writing, such swap data repository shall so suspend, limit, or revoke such access.

(iv) The registered swap data repository need not make the determination required pursuant to paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section more than once with respect to a recurring swap data request.

(iii) Satisfied its obligations under paragraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, such swap data repository shall provide access to the requested swap data; *provided, however,* that such swap data repository shall, if directed by the Commission in writing, limit, suspend or revoke such access should the Commission limit, suspend or revoke the appropriateness determination for such Appropriate Domestic Regulator or Appropriate Foreign Regulator or otherwise direct the swap data repository, in writing, to limit, suspend or revoke such access.

(3) If the Commission determines that an applicant pursuant to this paragraph is, conditionally or unconditionally, appropriate for purposes of CEA section 21(c)(7), the Commission shall issue an order setting forth its appropriateness determination. The Commission shall not determine that an applicant pursuant to this paragraph is appropriate unless the Commission is satisfied that -

(i) The applicant employs appropriate confidentiality safeguards to ensure that any swap data such applicant receives from a registered swap data repository will not be disclosed, except as allowed for in the form of confidentiality arrangement set forth in appendix B to this part 49 or, in the Commission's discretion as set forth in paragraph (d)(6) of this section, in a different form, provided that such confidentiality arrangement contains the elements required in § 49.18(b), and
