##### § 151.4 Position limits for Referenced Contracts. #####

(a) *Spot-month position limits.* In accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d) of this section, and except as provided or as otherwise authorized by § 151.5, no trader may hold or control a position, separately or in combination, net long or net short, in Referenced Contracts in the same commodity when such position is in excess of:

(1) For physical-delivery Referenced Contracts, a spot-month position limit that shall be based on one-quarter of the estimated spot-month deliverable supply as established by the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section; and

(2) For cash-settled Referenced Contracts:

(i) A spot-month position limit that shall be based on one-quarter of the estimated spot-month deliverable supply as established by the Commission pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section. *Provided, however,*

(ii) For New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contracts:

(A) A spot-month position limit equal to five times the spot-month position limit established by the Commission for the physical-delivery New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contract pursuant to paragraph (a)(1); and

(B) An aggregate spot-month position limit for physical-delivery and cash-settled New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contracts equal to five times the spot-month position limit established by the Commission for the physical-delivery New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contract pursuant to paragraph (a)(1).

(b) *Non-spot-month position limits.* In accordance with the procedure in paragraph (d) of this section, and except as otherwise authorized in § 151.5, no person may hold or control positions, separately or in combination, net long or net short, in the same commodity when such positions, in all months combined (including the spot month) or in a single month, are in excess of:

(1) *Non-legacy Referenced Contract position limits.* All-months-combined aggregate and single-month position limits, fixed by the Commission based on 10 percent of the first 25,000 contracts of average all-months-combined aggregated open interest with a marginal increase of 2.5 percent thereafter as established by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section;

(2) *Aggregate open interest calculations for non-spot-month position limits for non-legacy Referenced Contracts.* (i) For the purpose of fixing the speculative position limits for non-legacy Referenced Contracts in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Commission shall determine:

(A) The average all-months-combined aggregate open interest, which shall be equal to the sum, for 12 or 24 months of values obtained under paragraph (B) and (C) of this section for a period of 12 or 24 months prior to the fixing date divided by 12 or 24 respectively as of the last day of each calendar month;

(B) The all-months-combined futures open interest of a Referenced Contract is equal to the sum of the month-end open interest for all of the Referenced Contract's open contract months in futures and option contracts (on a delta adjusted basis) across all designated contract markets; and

(C) The all-months-combined swaps open interest is equal to the sum of all of a Referenced Contract's month-end open swaps positions, considering open positions attributed to both cleared and uncleared swaps, where the uncleared all-months-combined swaps open positions shall be the absolute sum of swap dealers' net uncleared open swaps positions by counterparty and by single Referenced Contract month as reported to the Commission pursuant to part 20 of this chapter, provided that, other than for the purpose of determining initial non-spot-month position limits, open swaps positions attributed to swaps with two swap dealer counterparties shall be counted once for the purpose of determining uncleared all-months-combined swaps open positions, provided further that, upon entry of an order under § 20.9 of this chapter determining that operating swap data repositories are processing positional data that will enable the Commission effectively to conduct surveillance in swaps, the Commission shall rely on data from such swap data repositories to compute the all-months-combined swaps open interest;

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, for the purpose of determining initial non-spot-month position limits for non-legacy Referenced Contracts, the Commission may estimate uncleared all-months-combined swaps open positions based on uncleared open swaps positions reported to the Commission pursuant to part 20 of this chapter by clearing organizations or clearing members that are swap dealers; and

(3) *Legacy agricultural Referenced Contract position limits.* All-months-combined aggregate and single-month position limits, fixed by the Commission at the levels provided below as established by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section:

|                        Referenced contract                         |Position limits|

(c) *Netting of positions* - (1) *For Referenced Contracts in the spot month.* (i) For the spot-month position limit in paragraph (a) of this section, a trader's positions in the physical-delivery Referenced Contract and cash-settled Referenced Contract are calculated separately. A trader cannot net any physical-delivery Referenced Contract with cash-settled Referenced Contracts towards determining the trader's positions in each of the physical-delivery Referenced Contract and cash-settled Referenced Contracts in paragraph (a) of this section. However, a trader can net positions in cash-settled Referenced Contracts in the same commodity.

(ii) Notwithstanding the netting provision in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, for the aggregate spot-month position limit in New York Mercantile Exchange Henry Hub Natural Gas Referenced Contracts in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a trader's positions shall be combined and the net resulting position in the physical-delivery Referenced Contract and cash-settled Referenced Contracts shall be applied towards determining the trader's aggregate position.

(2) For the purpose of applying non-spot-month position limits, a trader's position in a Referenced Contract shall be combined and the net resulting position shall be applied towards determining the trader's aggregate single-month and all-months-combined position.

(d) *Establishing and effective dates of position limits* - (1) *Initial spot-month position limits for Referenced Contracts* - (i) Sixty days after the term “swap” is further defined under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, the spot-month position limits for Referenced Contracts referred to in appendix A shall apply to all the provisions of this part.

(ii) In fixing spot-month position limits for Referenced Contracts, the Commission shall utilize the estimates of deliverable supply provided by a designated contract market under paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section unless the Commission determines to rely on its own estimate of deliverable supply.

(iii) Each designated contract market shall submit to the Commission an estimate of deliverable supply for each Core Referenced Futures Contract that is subject to a spot-month position limit and listed or executed pursuant to the rules of the designated contract market according to the following schedule commencing January 1st of the second calendar year after the term “swap” is further defined under the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010:

(D) For coffee, sugar, and cocoa Referenced Contracts, by the 30th of November following the submission of estimates of deliverable supply provided to the Commission under paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(D) of this section and annually thereafter.
