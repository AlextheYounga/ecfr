##### § 23.701 Notification of right to segregation. #####

(a) Prior to the execution of each swap transaction that is not submitted for clearing, a swap dealer or major swap participant shall:

(1) Notify each counterparty to such transaction that the counterparty has the right to require that any Initial Margin the counterparty provides in connection with such transaction be segregated in accordance with §§ 23.702 and 23.703 except in those circumstances where segregation is mandatory pursuant to § 23.157;

(2) Identify one or more custodians, one of which must be a creditworthy non-affiliate and each of which must be a legal entity independent of both the swap dealer or major swap participant and the counterparty, as an acceptable depository for segregated Initial Margin; and

(3) Provide information regarding the price of segregation for each custodian identified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, to the extent that the swap dealer or major swap participant has such information.

(b) The right referred to in paragraph (a) of this section does not extend to Variation Margin.

(c) The notification referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall be made to an officer of the counterparty responsible for the management of collateral. If no such party is identified by the counterparty to the swap dealer or major swap participant, then the notification shall be made to the Chief Risk Officer of the counterparty, or, if there is no such Officer, the Chief Executive Officer, or if none, the highest-level decision-maker for the counterparty.

(d) Prior to confirming the terms of any such swap, the swap dealer or major swap participant shall obtain from the counterparty confirmation of receipt by the person specified in paragraph (c) of this section of the notification specified in paragraph (a) of this section, and an election, if applicable, to require such segregation or not. The swap dealer or major swap participant shall maintain such confirmation and such election as business records pursuant to § 1.31 of this chapter.

(e) Notification pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to a particular counterparty by a particular swap dealer or major swap participant need only be made once in any calendar year.

(f) A counterparty's election, if applicable, to require segregation of Initial Margin or not to require such segregation, may be changed at the discretion of the counterparty upon written notice delivered to the swap dealer or major swap participant, which changed election shall be applicable to all swaps entered into between the parties after such delivery.
