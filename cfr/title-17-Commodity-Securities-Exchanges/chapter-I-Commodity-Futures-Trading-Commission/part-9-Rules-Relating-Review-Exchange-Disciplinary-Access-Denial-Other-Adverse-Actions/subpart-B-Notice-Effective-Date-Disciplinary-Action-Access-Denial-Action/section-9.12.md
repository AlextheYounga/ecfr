##### § 9.12 Effective date of disciplinary or access denial action. #####

(a) *Effective date.* Any disciplinary or access denial action taken by an exchange will not become effective until at least fifteen days after the written notice prescribed by § 9.11 is delivered to the person disciplined or denied access; *Provided, however,* That the exchange may cause a disciplinary action to become effective prior to that time if:

(1) As authorized by § 8.25 of this chapter, the exchange reasonably believes, and so states in its written decision, that immediate action is necessary to protect the best interests of the marketplace; or

(2) As authorized by § 8.17(b) of this chapter, the exchange determines, and so states in its written decision, that the actions of a person who is within the exchange's jurisdiction have impeded the progress of a disciplinary hearing; or

(3) As authorized by § 8.27 of this chapter, the exchange determines that a person has violated exchange rules relating to decorum or attire, or timely submission of accurate records required for clearing or verifying each day's transactions or other similar activities; or

(4) The person against whom the action is taken has consented to the penalty to be imposed and to the timing of its effectiveness.

(b) *Notice of early effective date.* If the exchange determines in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section that a disciplinary action will become effective prior to the expiration of fifteen days after written notice thereof, it must notify the person disciplined in writing, either personally or by telegram or other means of written telecommunication to the person's last known address, stating the reasons for the determination. The exchange must also by telegram or other means of written telecommunication immediately notify the Commission (Attention: Contracts Markets Section, Division of Market Oversight). Where notice is delivered by telegram or other means of written telecommunication, the time within which the person so notified may file a petition for stay pursuant to § 9.24(a)(2) will be increased by one day.
