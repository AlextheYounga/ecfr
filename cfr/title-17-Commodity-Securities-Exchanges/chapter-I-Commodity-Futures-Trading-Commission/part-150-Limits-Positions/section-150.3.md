(2) [Reserved]

(3) Spread or arbitrage positions between single months of a futures contract and/or, on a futures-equivalent basis, options thereon, outside of the spot month, in the same crop year; *provided however,* That such spread or arbitrage positions, when combined with any other net positions in the single month, do not exceed the all-months limit set forth in § 150.2; or

(4) Carried for an eligible entity as defined in § 150.1(d), in the separate account or accounts of an independent account controller, as defined in § 150.1(e), and not in the spot month if there is a position limit which applies to individual trading months during their expiration; *Provided, however,* That the overall positions held or controlled by each such independent account controller may not exceed the limits specified in § 150.2.

(A) Have, and enforce, written procedures to preclude the affiliated entities from having knowledge of, gaining access to, or receiving data about, trades of the other. Such procedures must include document routing and other procedures or security arrangements, including separate physical locations, which would maintain the independence of their activities; *provided, however,* That such procedures may provide for the disclosure of information which is reasonably necessary for an eligible entity to maintain the level of control consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and necessary to fulfill its duty to supervise diligently the trading done on its behalf;

(B) Trade such accounts pursuant to separately-developed and independent trading systems;

(C) Market such trading systems separately; and
