Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 17345, Apr. 25, 2019.

(a)(1) *General rule.* You must provide a clear and conspicuous notice to customers that accurately reflects your privacy policies and practices not less than annually during the life of the customer relationship. *Annually* means at least once in any period of 12 consecutive months during which that relationship exists. You may define the 12-consecutive-month period, but you must apply it to the customer on a consistent basis.

(2) *Example.* You provide notice annually if you define the 12-consecutive-month period as a calendar year and provide the annual notice to the customer once in each calendar year following the calendar year in which you provided the initial notice. For example, if a customer opens an account on any day of year 1, you must provide an annual notice to that customer by December 31 of year 2.

(b)(1) *Termination of customer relationship.* You are not required to provide an annual notice to a former customer.

(2) *Examples.* Your customer becomes a former customer when:

(i) The individual's commodity interest account is closed;

(ii) The individual's advisory contract or subscription is terminated or expires; or

(iii) The individual has redeemed all of his or her units in your pool.

(c) *Delivery of notice.* When you are required by this section to deliver an annual privacy notice, you must deliver it in the manner provided by ยง 160.9.
