##### § 30.12 Direct foreign order transmittal. #####

(a) *Authorized customers defined.* For the purposes of this section, an “authorized customer” of a futures commission merchant shall mean any foreign futures or foreign options customer, as defined in § 30.1(c), or its designated representative, that:

(1) The futures commission merchant has authorized to place orders for the account of the futures commission merchant's foreign futures and options customer omnibus account; and

(2)(i) Is an eligible swap participant, as defined in § 35.1(b)(2) of this chapter, or

(ii) Whose investment decisions with respect to foreign futures and foreign option transactions are made by a commodity trading advisor subject to regulation under the Act, including any investment adviser registered as such with the Securities and Exchange Commission that is exempt from regulation as a commodity trading advisor under the Act or Commission regulations, or a foreign person performing a similar role or function subject as such to foreign regulation, *provided* that the commodity trading advisor has total assets under management exceeding $50,000,000 and that the commodity trading advisor places the foreign futures or foreign options order.

(b) *Procedures for futures commission merchants.* It shall be unlawful for any futures commission merchant to permit an authorized customer to place orders for execution in the futures commission merchant's foreign futures and options customer omnibus account directly with a person exempt from registration under paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, unless, such futures commission merchant:

(1) Meets one of the following capital requirements, as determined by the futures commission merchant's most recent required filing of a Form 1-FR-FCM with the Commission:

(i) Possesses $20,000,000 in adjusted net capital, as defined by § 1.17(c)(5) of this chapter; or

(ii) Possesses the greater of three times the amount of adjusted net capital required by § 1.17(a)(1)(i)(A) of this chapter or three times the amount of adjusted net capital required by § 1.17(a)(1)(i)(B) of this chapter; and

(2) Has established control procedures that will serve as guidelines for permitting direct contacts between any authorized customer of the futures commission merchant and any person exempt from registration under paragraphs (c) or (d) of this section, and has in place appropriate risk management procedures to monitor its own risk relative to its authorized customers' risk aggregated across all markets, including, but not limited to, procedures to ensure that each authorized customer satisfies the participation criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and to specify the manner in which trades may be executed through its customer omnibus account pursuant to this section;

(3) Furnishes a written disclosure statement to each such authorized customer advising the customer of the additional risks the customer may be assuming in placing orders directly with the foreign broker. The disclosure statement must read as follows:

Direct Order Transmittal Client Disclosure Statement

This statement applies to the ability of authorized customers1 of [FCM] to place orders for foreign futures and options transactions directly with non-US entities (each, an “Executing Firm”) that execute transactions on behalf of [FCM's] foreign futures and options customer omnibus accounts.

1 You should contact your account executive regarding your eligibility to participate in the direct order transmittal process.

Please be aware of the following should you be permitted to place the type of orders specified above.

• The orders you place with an Executing Firm are for [FCM's] foreign futures and options customer omnibus account maintained with a foreign clearing firm. Consequently, [FCM] may limit or otherwise condition the orders you place with the Executing Firm.

• You should be aware of the relationship of the Executing Firm and [FCM]. [FCM] may not be responsible for the acts, omissions, or errors of the Executing Firm, or its representatives, with which you place your orders. In addition, the Executing Firm may not be affiliated with [FCM]. If you choose to place orders directly with an Executing Firm, you may be doing so at your own risk.

• It is your responsibility to inquire about the applicable laws and regulations that govern the foreign exchanges on which transactions will be executed on your behalf. Any orders placed by you for execution on that exchange will be subject to such rules and regulations, its customs and usages, as well as any local laws that may govern transactions on that exchange. These laws, rules, regulations, customs and usages may offer different or diminished protection from those that govern transactions on US exchanges. In particular, funds received from customers to margin foreign futures transactions may not be provided the same protections as funds received to margin futures transactions on domestic exchanges. Before you trade, you should familiarize yourself with the foreign rules which will apply to your particular transaction. United States regulatory authorities may be unable to compel the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets in non-US jurisdictions where transactions may be effected.

• It is your responsibility to determine whether the Executing Firm has consented to the jurisdiction of the courts in the United States. In general, neither the Executing Firm nor any individuals associated with the Executing Firm will be registered in any capacity with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Similarly, your contacts with the Executing Firm may not be sufficient to subject the Executing Firm to the jurisdiction of courts in the United States in the absence of the Executing Firm's consent. Accordingly, neither the courts of the United States nor the Commission's reparations program may be available as a forum for resolution of any disagreements you may have with the Executing Firm, and your recourse may be limited to actions outside the United States.

• Unless you object within five (5) days, by giving notice as provided in your customer agreement after receipt of this disclosure, [FCM] will assume your consent to the aforementioned conditions.

(c) *Exemption for foreign futures and options brokers.* Any person not located in the United States, its territories or possessions, who is otherwise required in accordance with this part to be registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant or as an introducing broker will be exempt from such registration, notwithstanding that such person accepts orders for foreign futures and foreign options transactions from authorized customers of a registered futures commission merchant that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, provided, that:

(1) The orders are executed for or on behalf of the foreign futures and options customer omnibus account of a registered futures commission merchant;

(2) The person does not solicit or accept any money, securities or property (or extend credit in lieu thereof) directly from any U.S. foreign futures and options customer to margin, guarantee or secure any trades or contracts that result or may result therefrom; and

(3) The person is a foreign futures and options broker, as defined by § 30.1(e).

(d) *Exemption for foreign futures and options brokers carrying a foreign futures and options customer omnibus account.* Any person not located in the United States, its territories or possessions, who is otherwise required in accordance with this part to be registered with the Commission as a futures commission merchant will be exempt from such registration, notwithstanding that such person:

(1) Carries the foreign futures and options customer omnibus account of a futures commission merchant that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section;

(2) Accepts orders for foreign futures and foreign options transactions from authorized customers for the execution of the trades for or on behalf of the foreign futures and options customer omnibus account of a registered futures commission merchant either directly or pursuant to a give-up arrangement; and

(3) The person is a foreign futures and options broker, as defined by § 30.1(e).
