(*1*) The interest payments on variable rate securities must correlate closely and on an unleveraged basis to a benchmark of either the Federal Funds target or effective rate, the prime rate, the three-month Treasury Bill rate, a Secured Overnight Financing Rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or a CME Term SOFR Rate published by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited, or the interest rate of any fixed rate instrument that is a permitted investment listed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

(*3*) The term *variable rate security* means a security, the terms of which provide for the adjustment of its interest rate on set dates (such as the last day of a month or calendar quarter) and that, upon each adjustment until the final maturity of the instrument or the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand, can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its amortized cost.

(D) Interests in any individual government money market fund or U.S. Treasury exchange-traded fund may not exceed 10 percent of the total assets held in segregation by the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization.

(E) For purposes of determining compliance with the issuer-based concentration limits set forth in this section, securities issued by entities that are affiliated, as defined in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, shall be aggregated and deemed the securities of a single issuer. An interest in a permitted government money market fund or U.S. Treasury exchange-traded fund is not deemed to be a security issued by its sponsoring entity.

(4) *Time-to-maturity.* (i) Except for investments in government money market funds, U.S. Treasury exchange-traded funds, and permitted foreign sovereign debt subject to the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section, the dollar-weighted average of the time-to-maturity of the portfolio, as that average is computed pursuant to 17 CFR 270.2a-7, may not exceed 24 months.

(ii) For purposes of determining the time-to-maturity of the portfolio, an instrument that is set forth in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section may be treated as having a one-day time-to-maturity if the following terms and conditions are satisfied:

A futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization that is an authorized participant of the fund may redeem interests in the fund in kind, provided that the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization is able to convert the securities received pursuant to the in-kind redemption into cash within one business day of the redemption request. A futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization that transacts with the fund through an authorized participant acting as an agent for the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization must have a contractual agreement obligating the authorized participant to pay the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's redemption of interests in the fund in cash within one business day of the redemption request.

(B) *Secondary market transactions.* The futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization acquires or sells interests in the fund on a national securities exchange registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

(d) *Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.* A futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization may buy and sell the permitted investments listed in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section pursuant to agreements for resale or repurchase of the securities (agreements to repurchase or resell), provided the agreements to repurchase or resell conform to the following requirements:

(1) The securities are specifically identified by coupon rate, par amount, market value, maturity date, and CUSIP or ISIN number.

(2) Permitted counterparties are limited to a bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a domestic branch of a foreign bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a securities broker or dealer, or a government securities dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or which has filed notice pursuant to section 15C(a) of the Government Securities Act of 1986. In addition, with respect to agreements to repurchase or resell permitted foreign sovereign debt, the following entities are also permitted counterparties: a foreign bank that qualifies as a depository under § 1.49(d)(3) and that is located in a money center country as the term is defined in § 1.49(a)(1) or in another jurisdiction that has adopted the currency in which the permitted foreign sovereign debt is denominated as its currency; a securities broker or dealer located in a money center country as the term is defined in § 1.49(a)(1) and that is regulated by a national financial regulator or a provincial financial regulator with respect to a Canadian securities broker or dealer; and the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Banque de France, the Bank of Japan, the Deutsche Bundesbank, or the European Central Bank.

(3) A futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization shall not enter into an agreement to repurchase or resell with a counterparty that is an affiliate of the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization, respectively. An affiliate includes parent companies, including all entities through the ultimate holding company, subsidiaries to the lowest level, and companies under common ownership of such parent company or affiliates.

(4) The transaction is executed in compliance with the concentration limit requirements applicable to the securities transferred to the customer segregated custodial account in connection with the agreements to repurchase referred to in paragraphs (b)(3)(iii)(A) and (B) of this section.

(5) The transaction is made pursuant to a written agreement signed by the parties to the agreement, which is consistent with the conditions set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (13) of this section and which states that the parties thereto intend the transaction to be treated as a purchase and sale of securities.

(6) The term of the agreement is no more than one business day, or reversal of the transaction is possible on demand.

(7) Securities transferred to the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization under the agreement are held in a safekeeping account with a bank as referred to in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a Federal Reserve Bank, a derivatives clearing organization, or the Depository Trust Company in an account that complies with the requirements of § 1.26. Securities transferred to the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization under an agreement related to permitted foreign sovereign debt may also be held in a safekeeping account that complies with the requirements of § 1.26 at a foreign bank that meets the location and qualification requirements in § 1.49(c) and (d), or with the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the Banque de France, the Bank of Japan, the Deutsche Bundesbank, or the European Central Bank.

(8) The futures commission merchant or the derivatives clearing organization may not use securities received under the agreement in another similar transaction and may not otherwise hypothecate or pledge such securities, except securities may be pledged on behalf of customers at another futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization. Substitution of securities is allowed, *provided, however,* that:

(i) The qualifying securities being substituted and original securities are specifically identified by date of substitution, market values substituted, coupon rates, par amounts, maturity dates and CUSIP or ISIN numbers;

(ii) Substitution is made on a “delivery versus delivery” basis; and

(iii) The market value of the substituted securities is at least equal to that of the original securities.

(9) The transfer of securities to the customer segregated custodial account is made on a delivery versus payment basis in immediately available funds. The transfer of funds to the customer segregated cash account is made on a payment versus delivery basis. The transfer is not recognized as accomplished until the funds and/or securities are actually received by the custodian of the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's customer funds or securities purchased on behalf of customers. The transfer or credit of securities covered by the agreement to the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's customer segregated custodial account is made simultaneously with the disbursement of funds from the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's customer segregated cash account at the custodian bank. On the sale or resale of securities, the futures commission merchant's or derivatives clearing organization's customer segregated cash account at the custodian bank must receive same-day funds credited to such segregated account simultaneously with the delivery or transfer of securities from the customer segregated custodial account.

(10) A written confirmation to the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization specifying the terms of the agreement and a safekeeping receipt are issued immediately upon entering into the transaction and a confirmation to the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization is issued once the transaction is reversed.

(11) The transactions effecting the agreement are recorded in the record required to be maintained under § 1.27 of investments of customer funds, and the securities subject to such transactions are specifically identified in such record as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section and further identified in such record as being subject to repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.

(12) An actual transfer of securities to the customer segregated custodial account by book entry is made consistent with Federal or State commercial law, as applicable. At all times, securities received subject to an agreement are reflected as “customer property.”

(13) The agreement makes clear that, in the event of the bankruptcy of the futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization, any securities purchased with customer funds that are subject to an agreement may be immediately transferred. The agreement also makes clear that, in the event of a futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization bankruptcy, the counterparty has no right to compel liquidation of securities subject to an agreement or to make a priority claim for the difference between current market value of the securities and the price agreed upon for resale of the securities to the counterparty, if the former exceeds the latter.

(e) *Deposit of firm-owned securities into segregation.* A futures commission merchant may deposit unencumbered securities of the type specified in this section, which it owns for its own account, into a customer account. A futures commission merchant must include such securities, transfers of securities, and disposition of proceeds from the sale or maturity of such securities in the record of investments required to be maintained by § 1.27. All such securities may be segregated in safekeeping only with a bank, trust company, derivatives clearing organization, or other registered futures commission merchant in accordance with the provisions of § 1.20 part. For purposes of this section and §§ 1.27, 1.28, 1.29, and 1.32, securities of the type specified by this section that are owned by the futures commission merchant and deposited into a customer account shall be considered customer funds until such investments are withdrawn from segregation in accordance with the provisions of § 1.23. Investments permitted by § 1.25 that are owned by the futures commission merchant and deposited into a futures customer account pursuant to § 1.26 shall be considered futures customer funds until such investments are withdrawn from segregation in accordance with § 1.23. Investments permitted by § 1.25 that are owned by the futures commission merchant and deposited into a Cleared Swaps Customer Account, as defined in § 22.1 of this chapter, shall be considered Cleared Swaps Customer Collateral, as defined in § 22.1 of this chapter, until such investments are withdrawn from segregation in accordance with § 22.17 of this chapter.

(f) *Permitted foreign sovereign debt.* The following provisions will apply to investments of customer funds in permitted foreign sovereign debt.

(1) The dollar-weighted average of the remaining time-to-maturity of the portfolio of investments in permitted foreign sovereign debt, as that average is computed pursuant to 17 CFR 270.2a-7 on a country-by-country basis, may not exceed 60 calendar days. Permitted foreign sovereign debt instruments acquired under an agreement to resell shall be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the date on which the resale of the underlying instruments is scheduled to occur, or, where the agreement is subject to demand, the notice period applicable to a demand for the resale of the securities. Permitted foreign sovereign debt instruments sold under an agreement to repurchase shall be included in the calculation of the dollar-weighted average based on the remaining time-to-maturity of each instrument sold.

(2) A futures commission merchant or a derivatives clearing organization may not invest customer funds in any permitted foreign sovereign debt that has a remaining maturity greater than 180 calendar days.

(3) If the two-year credit default spread, computed as the average of the bid and ask prices between willing buyers and sellers, of an issuing sovereign of permitted foreign sovereign debt is greater than 45 basis points:

(i) The futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization shall not make any new investments in that sovereign's debt using customer funds.

(ii) The futures commission merchant or derivatives clearing organization must discontinue investing customer funds in that sovereign's debt through agreements to resell as soon as practicable under the circumstances.
