Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 33355, June 1, 2020.

(a) The date on which any papers are actually received by the Commission shall be the date of filing thereof, if all the requirements of the act and the rules with respect to such filing have been complied with and the required fee paid. The failure to pay an insignificant amount of the required fee at the time of filing, as the result of a bona fide error, shall not be deemed to affect the date of filing.

(b)(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, a well-known seasoned issuer that registers securities offerings on an automatic shelf registration statement, or registers additional securities or classes of securities thereon pursuant to Rule 413(b) (§ 230.413(b)), may, but is not required to, defer payment of all or any part of the registration fee to the Commission required by section 6(b)(2) of the Act on the following conditions:

(i) If the issuer elects to defer payment of the registration fee, it shall pay the registration fees (pay-as-you-go registration fees) calculated in accordance with Rule 457(r) (§ 230.457(r)) in advance of or in connection with an offering of securities from the registration statement within the time required to file the prospectus supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§ 230.424(b)) for the offering, *provided, however*, that if the issuer fails, after a good faith effort to pay the filing fee within the time required by this section, the issuer may still be considered to have paid the fee in a timely manner if it is paid within four business days of its original due date; and

(ii) The issuer reflects the amount of the pay-as-you-go registration fee paid or to be paid in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section by updating the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table to indicate the class and aggregate offering price of securities offered and the amount of registration fee paid or to be paid in connection with the offering or offerings either in a post-effective amendment filed at the time of the fee payment or on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) (§ 230.424(b)).

(2) A registration statement filed relying on the pay-as-you-go registration fee payment provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section will be considered filed as to the securities or classes of securities identified in the registration statement for purposes of this section and section 5 of the Act when it is received by the Commission, if it complies with all other requirements of the Act and the rules with respect to it.

(3) The securities sold pursuant to a registration statement will be considered registered, for purposes of section 6(a) of the Act, if the pay-as-you-go registration fee has been paid and the post-effective amendment or prospectus including the amended “Calculation of Registration Fee” table is filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(c)(1) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, an asset-backed issuer that registers asset-backed securities offerings on Form SF-3 (§ 239.45 of this chapter), may, but is not required to, defer payment of all or any part of the registration fee to the Commission required by section 6(b)(1) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77f(b)(1)) on the following conditions:

(i) If the issuer elects to defer payment of the registration fee, it shall pay the registration fees (pay-as-you-go registration fees) calculated in accordance with § 230.457(s) in advance of or in connection with an offering of securities from the registration statement at the time of filing the prospectus pursuant to § 230.424(h) for the offering; and

(ii) The issuer reflects the amount of the pay-as-you-go registration fee paid or to be paid in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section by updating the “Calculation of Registration Fee” table to indicate the class and aggregate offering price of securities offered and the amount of registration fee paid or to be paid in connection with the offering or offerings on the cover page of a prospectus filed pursuant to § 230.424(h).

(2) A registration statement filed relying on the pay-as-you-go registration fee payment provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be considered filed as to the securities or classes of securities identified in the registration statement for purposes of this section and section 5 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77e) when it is received by the Commission, if it complies with all other requirements of the Act and the rules with respect to it.

(3) The securities sold pursuant to a registration statement will be considered registered, for purpose of section 6(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 77f(a)), if the pay-as-you-go registration fee has been paid and the prospectus including the amended “Calculation of Registration Fee” table is filed pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
