##### ยง 230.484 Undertaking required in certain registration statements. #####

If a registration statement is prepared on a form available solely to investment companies registered under the investment Company Act of 1940, or a business development company which is selling or proposing to sell its securities pursuant to a registration statement which has been filed under the Act, if

(a) Any acceleration is requested of the effective date of the registration statement pursuant to Rule 461 (ยง 230.461), and

(b)(1) Any provision or arrangement exists whereby the registrant may indemnify a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant against liabilities arising under the Act, or

(2) The underwriting agreement contains provisions by which indemnification against such liabilities is given by the registrant to the underwriter or controlling persons of the underwriter and the director, officer or controlling person of the registrant is such an underwriter or controlling person thereof or a member of any firm which is an underwriter, and

(3) The benefits of such indemnification are not waived by such persons; the registration statement shall include a brief description of the indemnification provisions and an undertaking in substantially the following form:

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
