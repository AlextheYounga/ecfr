(a) *Prospectus.* Except as provided by this section, Item 1100(c) of Regulation AB (§ 229.1100(c) of this chapter) for registered offerings of asset-backed securities, or unless otherwise provided in the appropriate form, information shall not be incorporated by reference in a prospectus. Where a summary or outline of the provisions of any document is required in the prospectus, the summary or outline may incorporate by reference particular items, sections or paragraphs of any exhibit and may be qualified in its entirety by such reference.

(b) *Information not required in a prospectus.* Except for exhibits covered by paragraph (c) of this section, information may be incorporated by reference in answer, or partial answer, to any item that calls for information not required to be included in a prospectus subject to the following provisions:

(1) Non-financial information may be incorporated by reference to any document;

(2) Financial information may be incorporated by reference to any document, provided any financial statement so incorporated meets the requirements of the forms on which the statement is filed. Financial statements or other financial data required to be given in comparative form for two or more fiscal years or periods shall not be incorporated by reference unless the information incorporated by reference includes the entire period for which the comparative data is given;

(3) Information contained in any part of the registration statement, including the prospectus, may be incorporated by reference in answer, or partial answer, to any item that calls for information not required to be included in the prospectus; and

(4) Unless the information is incorporated by reference to a document which complies with the time limitations of § 228.10(f) and § 229.10(d) of this chapter, then the document, or part thereof, containing the incorporated information is required to be filed as an exhibit.

(c) *Exhibits.* Any document or part thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to any Act administered by the Commission may, subject to the limitations of § 228.10(f) and § 229.11(d) of this chapter, be incorporated by reference as an exhibit to any registration statement. If any modification has occurred in the text of any document incorporated by reference since the filing thereof, the registrant shall file with the reference a statement containing the text of such modification and the date thereof.

(d) *General.* Any incorporation by reference of information pursuant to this section shall be subject to the provisions of Rule 24 of the Commission's Rules of Practice restricting incorporation by reference of documents which incorporate by reference other information. Information incorporated by reference shall be clearly identified in the reference by page, paragraph, caption or otherwise. If the information is incorporated by reference to a previously filed document, the file number of such document shall be included. Where only certain pages of a document are incorporated by reference and filed with the statement, the document from which the information is taken shall be clearly identified in the reference. An express statement that the specified matter is incorporated by reference shall be made at the particular place in the registration statement where the information is required. Information shall not be incorporated by reference in any case where such incorporation would render the statement incomplete, unclear or confusing.
