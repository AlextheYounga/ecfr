Form N-27F-1 Notice to Periodic Payment Plan Certificate Holders of 45-Day Withdrawal Right With Respect to Periodic Payment Plan CertificatesImportant(Date of mailing)Re: \_\_ (1) \_\_

Dear \_\_ (2) \_\_: This notice is required to be sent to all purchasers of plan certificates pursuant to laws administered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should read it carefully and retain it with your financial records.

Of the $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (3) \_\_ you have paid on your \_\_ (4) \_\_ plan, representing \_\_ (5) \_\_ regular monthly payments, $\_\_\_\_\_ (6) \_\_ or \_\_ (7) \_\_ percent has been deducted for various charges.

[The following sentence is to be included when any periodic payment remains outstanding in which the sales load charges exceed 9 percent of such payment.]

A total of $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (8) \_\_ or \_\_ (9) \_\_ percent of your first \_\_ (10) \_\_ monthly payments will be deducted from those payments for similar charges.

Charges of $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (11) \_\_ or \_\_ (12) \_\_ percent will be deducted from each subsequent payment. You have until \_\_ (13) \_\_ to surrender your certificate for any reason and receive a refund of all of the charges which have been deducted from your payments, and, in addition, the value of your account on the date your certificate is received.

In determining whether or not to exercise your right you should consider, among other things, the projected cost of your investment and your ability to make the scheduled payments over the life of your plan as they become due. Your plan provides for \_\_ (14) \_\_ payments of $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (15) \_\_ per \_\_ (16) \_\_, or total payments of $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (17) \_\_. If you made all of the scheduled payments over the full term of your plan, the total deductions would be $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (18) \_\_ or an effective charge of \_\_ (19) \_\_ percent of your total payments. However, if you do not complete your program, the deduction of various charges from your initial payments will result in your paying effective charges in excess of that rate. For a more complete description of the charges deducted under your plan, carefully review your prospectus.

If you wish to exercise your right of withdrawal, return your plan certificate to \_\_ (20) \_\_ by \_\_ (21) \_\_ in accordance with the enclosed instructions.

Very truly yours,

\_\_ (22) \_\_.
