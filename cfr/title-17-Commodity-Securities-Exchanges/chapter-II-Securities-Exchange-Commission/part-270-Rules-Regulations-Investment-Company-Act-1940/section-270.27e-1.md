Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 26110, May 1, 2020.

(a) The notice required by section 27(e) of the Act shall be sent by first class mail and shall be accompanied by a written instruction sheet and a return form to be used in connection with the exercise of the surrender right described in the notice. No other written or graphic material may be included with such notice.

(b) In the event that regular payments throughout the first 18 months of the plan are required less frequently than monthly, such a notice shall be mailed to any certificate holder who has missed any payment or payments equal to or greater in amount than the amount of payments which, if missed, would have required the mailing of a notice if equal monthly payments had been required during such 15- or 18-month periods.

(c) Any payment not made within 31 days after it is due shall be deemed a missed payment whether or not an equivalent payment is made subsequently by the certificate holder.

(d) In the event any such notice is not mailed prior to 15 days before the expiration of the 18th month, the certificate holder shall have 15 days from the date such notice is mailed within which to exercise the right of surrender described therein. Nothing herein contained shall require a second notice to be mailed to any certificate holder who has been mailed a notice within 30 days following 15 months after the issuance of his certificate.

(e) Notwithstanding the requirements of section 27(e) of the Act, no notice need be mailed to a certificate holder if, at the time such notice would be required to be mailed, he would not be entitled to receive any refund of sales loading upon surrender of his certificate.

(f) Form N-27E-1 is hereby prescribed to inform certificate holders of their right to surrender their certificates pursuant to section 27(d) of the Act. The text of Form N-27E-1 is as follows:

Form N-27E-1 - Notice to Periodic Payment Plan Certificate Holders of 8 Months Surrender Rights With Respect to Periodic Payment Plan Certificates2

2 See the General Instructions to Form N-27E-1 in paragraph (f) of § 270.27e-1 of this chapter, 36 FR 13138.

Important(Date of mailing)Re: \_(1) \_\_\_.

Dear \_(2) \_\_\_: This notice is required to be sent to all purchasers of plan certificates pursuant to laws administered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. You should read it carefully and retain it with your financial records.

You have missed \_(3) \_\_\_ after your \_ (4) \_\_\_ plan certificate was issued. Until \_ (5) \_\_\_ you will be entitled to surrender your plan certificate and receive, in addition to the value of your account on the date your certificate is received, a refund of that portion of the sales charges you have paid in excess of 15 percent of the gross payments under your plan.

For example, if your certificate had been received for surrender \_ (6) \_\_\_ you would have received a total of $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (7) \_\_\_ for it (the value of your account $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (8) \_\_\_ plus a refund of $\_\_\_\_\_\_ (9) \_\_\_ of the sales charges you have paid). After your right expires you will be entitled to receive only the value of your account. Of course, the value of your account will vary from day to day and by the date your right expires it may be more or less than it is today.

In determining whether to exercise your right to terminate your plan, you should consider that, while the average sales charge deducted from your payments has amounted to \_ (10) \_\_\_ percent of the total payments made, the sales charge for the remainder of the payments under the plan, if you continue the plan, will be \_ (11) \_\_\_and the average sales charge if you complete the plan will be \_ (12) \_\_\_ percent. Exercising your right to terminate your plan, however, will result in a net sales charge of 15 percent of your total payments. Accordingly, if you believe you may discontinue making further payments on your plan, it would probably be to your advantage to exercise this right now.

If you wish to exercise your right to terminate your plan, you may return your certificate to \_ (13) \_\_\_ by \_ (14) \_\_\_ in accordance with the enclosed instructions.

Very truly yours,\_ (15) \_\_\_.Form N-27E-1 Instructions
