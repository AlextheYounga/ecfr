(b) Paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to a registered closed-end management investment company whose registration statement was filed on Form N-2; provided that the following information is transmitted to shareholders in its annual report to shareholders:

(1) If the company offers a dividend reinvestment plan to shareholders, information about the plan required to be disclosed in the company's prospectus by Item 10.1.e of Form N-2 (17 CFR 274.11a-1);

(2) Any material changes in the company's investment objectives or policies (described in Item 8.2 of Form N-2) that have not been approved by shareholders;

(3) Any changes in the company's charter or by-laws that would delay or prevent a change of control of the company (described in Item 10.1.f of Form N-2) that have not been approved by shareholders;

(4) Any material changes in the principal risk factors associated with investment in the company (described in Item 8.3 of Form N-2); and
