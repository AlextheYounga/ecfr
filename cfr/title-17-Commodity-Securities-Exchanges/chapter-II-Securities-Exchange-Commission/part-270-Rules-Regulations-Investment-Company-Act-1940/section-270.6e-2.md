(1) Such separate account is established and maintained by a life insurance company pursuant to the insurance laws or code of (i) any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia, or (ii) Canada or any province thereof, if it complies to the extent necessary with Rule 7d-1 (17 CFR 270.7d-1) under the Act;

(2) The assets of the separate account are derived solely from the sale of variable life insurance contracts as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this Rule 6e-2, and advances made by the life insurance company which established and maintains the separate account (“life insurer”) in connection with the operation of such separate account;

(3) The separate account is not used for variable annuity contracts or for funds corresponding to dividend accumulations or other contract liabilities not involving life contingencies;

(6) The assets of the separate account have, at each time during the year that adjustments in the reserves are made, a value at least equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to such separate account, and at all other times, except pursuant to an order of the Commission, have a value approximately equal to or in excess of such reserves and liabilities; and

(7) The investment adviser of the separate account is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

(5) Section 13(a) to the extent that:

(B) Such change would be inconsistent with the investment objectives of the separate account or would result in the purchase of securities for the separate account which vary from the general quality and nature of investments and investment techniques utilized by other separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company, which separate accounts have investment objectives similar to the separate account;

(A) Surrender the contract at any time during the first 24 months after issuance and receive in cash an amount not less than the sum of the present value of his contract which is the cash surrender value next computed after receipt by the life insurer of the request for surrender in proper form, plus, depending upon the period over which such contract has been retained by the contractholder, an amount which is a refund of any excess paid for sales loading prior to surrender: *Provided, however,* That if payments for the contract have not been duly paid on the date the request for surrender is received by the life insurer, and if the sum of the cash surrender value and the amount of any excess sales loading which would otherwise be refundable in cash were applied to provide (without sales loading) a nonforfeiture benefit in accordance with the contract, then the contractholder shall be entitled to receive in cash the present value, next computed after receipt by the life insurer of the request for surrender in proper form, of any non-forfeiture benefit then in force. The amount of sales loading to be refunded shall be equal to that part of the excess paid for sales loading which is over the sum of 30 per centum of payments made for the first contract year plus 10 per centum of the payments made for the second contract year; and

(vii) Section 27(e) and Rule 27e-1 thereunder to the extent that the separate account and the depositor and principal underwriter therefor, when such persons are subject to paragraph (b)(13)(v) of this Rule, are required to provide a notice of right of withdrawal and refund to holders of variable life insurance contracts, if the life insurer or a duly authorized agent provides a notice of withdrawal and refund rights on Form N-27I-1, to the holder of any variable life insurance contract under which a refund may be available, provided that such notice shall be sent by first class mail to the contractholder:

(A) At issuance of the variable life insurance contract, which notice may be sent together with the issued variable life insurance contract and an illustration, in a form appropriate for inclusion in the prospectus for the variable life insurance contract, of gross annual payments, death benefits and cash surrender values applicable to the age, sex and underwriting classification of the insured; and

(c) When used in this rule:

(1) *Variable life insurance contract* means a contract of life insurance, subject to regulation under the insurance laws or code of every jurisdiction in which it is offered, funded by a separate account of a life insurer, which contract, so long as payments are duly paid in accordance with its terms, provides for:

(i) A death benefit and cash surrender value which vary to reflect the investment experience of the separate account;

(ii) An initial stated dollar amount of death benefit, and payment of a death benefit guaranteed by the life insurer to be at least equal to such stated amount; and

(iii) Assumption of the mortality and expense risks thereunder by the life insurer for which a charge against the assets of the separate account may be assessed. Such charge shall be disclosed in the prospectus and shall not be less than fifty per centum of the maximum charge for risk assumption as disclosed in the prospectus and as provided for in the contract.

(2) *Incidental insurance benefits* means insurance benefits provided pursuant to the variable life insurance contract, other than the minimum and variable death benefit, which do not vary in amount or duration in accordance with the investment performance of the separate account, and include, but are not limited to, accidental death and dismemberment benefits, disability income benefits, guaranteed insurability options, and family income or fixed benefit term riders.

(3) *Minimum death benefit* is the amount guaranteed by the life insurer to be paid pursuant to a variable life insurance contract in the event of the death of the insured without regard to the investment performance of the separate account funding the variable life insurance contract, if payments are duly made and if there are no outstanding loans, partial withdrawals or partial surrenders, but does not include any incidental insurance benefits.

(4) *Sales load* charged on any payment is the excess of the payment over the sum of the following:

(i) The amount of the cash value for the first contract year, if any, and the amount of the increase in the cash value for each subsequent contract year, that is attributable to payments made and not attributable to investment earnings;

(ii) The cost of insurance for the period for which the payment is made based on the 1958 Commissioners Standard Ordinary Mortality Table and the assumed investment rate specified in the contract;

(iii) A reasonable charge necessary to cover the risk assumed by the life insurer that the variable death benefit will be less than the guaranteed minimum death benefit;

(iv) Any administrative expenses or fees which are reasonable and in amounts not exceeding anticipated administrative expenses and fees not properly chargeable to sales or promotional activities;

(v) A deduction approximately equal to state premium taxes;

(vi) Any additional charge assessed if the insured does not meet standard underwriting requirements;

(vii) Any additional charge assessed specifically for any incidental insurance benefits which do not vary in relation to the performance of the separate account;

(viii) Any additional charge, in the nature of an interest or service charge or administrative fee, assessed when payments are made more frequently than annually;

(ix) For a participating variable life insurance contract, a deduction for dividends to be paid or credited in accordance with the dividend scale in effect on the issue date of the contract assuming a gross annual investment return for the separate account which funds such contract of 4 percent after deduction for any Federal income taxes, which deduction may be determined pursuant to either of the following methods, provided that the same method must be applied with respect to each payment under the contract:

(A) The actuarial level annual equivalent of dividends to be paid or credited over the period described in paragraph (b)(13)(i) of this section, based upon the mortality, interest and lapse assumptions used in computing the dividend scale for such contract multiplied by the fraction of the contract year for which the payment is made; or

(B) That portion of the dividend to be paid for the contract year which does not depend on the making of additional payments.

(5) *Assumed investment rate* is the rate of investment return specified in the contract which would be required to be credited to a variable life insurance contract, after deduction of charges for Federal income taxes, investment management fees, portfolio transaction expenses and mortality and expense guarantees, to maintain the variable death benefit equal at all times to the amount of death benefit, other than incidental insurance benefits, which would be payable pursuant to the variable life insurance contract if the death benefit did not vary according to the investment experience of the separate account.
