<sup>1</sup> Information as to put options shall be shown separately from information as to call options.

<sup>2</sup> Options where descriptions, counterparties, exercise prices or expiration dates differ shall be listed separately.

<sup>3</sup> Options on underlying investments where the underlying investment would otherwise be presented in accordance with §§ 210.12-12, 12-13A, 12-13B, 12-13C, or 12-13D should include the description of the underlying investment as would be required by §§ 210.12-12, 12-13A, 12-13B, 12-13C, or 12-13D as part of the description of the option.

If the underlying investment is an index or basket of investments, and the components are publicly available on a Web site as of the balance sheet date, identify the index or basket. If the underlying investment is an index or basket of investments, the components are not publicly available on a Web site as of the balance sheet date, and the notional amount of the option contract does not exceed one percent of the net asset value of the registrant as of the close of the period, identify the index or basket. If the underlying investment is an index or basket of investments, the components are not publicly available on a Web site as of the balance sheet date, and the notional amount of the option contract exceeds one percent of the net asset value of the registrant as of the close of the period, provide a description of the index or custom basket and list separately: (i) The 50 largest components in the index or custom basket and (ii) any other components where the notional value for that components exceeds 1% of the notional value of the index or custom basket.
