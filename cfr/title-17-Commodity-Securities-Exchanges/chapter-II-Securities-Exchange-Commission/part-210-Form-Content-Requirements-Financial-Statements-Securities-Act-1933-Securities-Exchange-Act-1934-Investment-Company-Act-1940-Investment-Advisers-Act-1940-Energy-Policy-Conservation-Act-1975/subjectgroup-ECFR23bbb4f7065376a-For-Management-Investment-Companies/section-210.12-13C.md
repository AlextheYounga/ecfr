If the reference instrument is an index or basket of investments, the components are not publicly available on a Web site as of the balance sheet date, and the notional amount of the swap contract exceeds one percent of the net asset value of the registrant as of the close of the period provide a description of the index or custom basket and list separately: (i) The 50 largest components in the index or custom basket and (ii) any other components where the notional value for that components exceeds 1% of the notional value of the index or custom basket.
