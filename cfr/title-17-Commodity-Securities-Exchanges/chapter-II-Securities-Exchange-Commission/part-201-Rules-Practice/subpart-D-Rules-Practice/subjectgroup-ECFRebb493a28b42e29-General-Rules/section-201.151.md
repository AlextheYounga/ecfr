##### ยง 201.151 Filing of papers with the Commission: Procedure. #####

(a) *When to file.* All papers required to be served by a party upon any person shall be filed contemporaneously with the Commission. Papers required to be filed with the Commission must be received within the time limit, if any, for such filing. Filing with the Commission may be made by facsimile transmission if the party also contemporaneously transmits to the Commission a non-facsimile original with a manual signature. However, any person filing with the Commission by facsimile transmission will be responsible for assuring that the Commission receives a complete and legible filing within the time limit set for such filing.

(b) *Where to file.* Filing of papers with the Commission shall be made by filing them with the Secretary. When a proceeding is assigned to a hearing officer, a person making a filing with the Secretary shall promptly provide to the hearing officer a copy of any such filing, provided, however, that the hearing officer may direct or permit filings to be made with him or her, in which event the hearing officer shall note thereon the filing date and promptly provide the Secretary with either the original or a copy of any such filings.

(c) *To whom to direct the filing.* Unless otherwise provided, where the Commission has assigned a case to a hearing officer, all motions, objections, applications or other filings made during a proceeding prior to the filing of an initial decision therein, or, if no initial decision is to be filed, prior to the time fixed for the filing of briefs with the Commission, shall be directed to and decided by the hearing officer.

(d) *Certificate of service.* Papers filed with the Commission or a hearing officer shall be accompanied by a certificate stating the name of the person or persons served, the date of service, the method of service and the mailing address or facsimile telephone number to which service was made, if not made in person. If the method of service to any party is different from the method of service to any other party or the method for filing with the Commission, the certificate shall state why a different means of service was used.
