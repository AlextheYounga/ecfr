##### § 275.203-1 Application for investment adviser registration. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 33630, July 12, 2019.

(a) *Form ADV.* To apply for registration with the Commission as an investment adviser, you must complete Form ADV [17 CFR 279.1] by following the instructions in the form and you must file Part 1A of Form ADV and the firm brochure(s) required by Part 2A of Form ADV electronically with the Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD) unless you have received a hardship exemption under § 275.203-3. You are not required to file with the Commission the brochure supplements required by Part 2B of Form ADV.

Note to paragraph (a):

Information on how to file with the IARD is available on the Commission's Web site at *http://www.sec.gov/iard.* If you are not required to deliver a brochure to any clients, you are not required to prepare or file a brochure with the Commission. If you are not required to deliver a brochure supplement to any clients for any particular supervised person, you are not required to prepare a brochure supplement for that supervised person.

(b) *When filed.* Each Form ADV is considered filed with the Commission upon acceptance by the IARD.

(c) *Filing fees.* You must pay FINRA (the operator of the IARD) a filing fee. The Commission has approved the amount of the filing fee. No portion of the filing fee is refundable. Your completed application for registration will not be accepted by FINRA, and thus will not be considered filed with the Commission, until you have paid the filing fee.
