##### § 275.205-1 Definition of “investment performance” of an investment company and “investment record” of an appropriate index of securities prices. #####

(a) *Investment performance* of an investment company for any period shall mean the sum of:

(1) The change in its net asset value per share during such period;

(2) The value of its cash distributions per share accumulated to the end of such period; and

(3) The value of capital gains taxes per share paid or payable on undistributed realized long-term capital gains accumulated to the end of such period; expressed as a percentage of its net asset value per share at the beginning of such period. For this purpose, the value of distributions per share of realized capital gains, of dividends per share paid from investment income and of capital gains taxes per share paid or payable on undistributed realized long-term capital gains shall be treated as reinvested in shares of the investment company at the net asset value per share in effect at the close of business on the record date for the payment of such distributions and dividends and the date on which provision is made for such taxes, after giving effect to such distributions, dividends and taxes.

(b) *Investment record* of an appropriate index of securities prices for any period shall mean the sum of:

(1) The change in the level of the index during such period; and

(2) The value, computed consistently with the index, of cash distributions made by companies whose securities comprise the index accumulated to the end of such period; expressed as a percentage of the index level at the beginning of such period. For this purpose cash distributions on the securities which comprise the index shall be treated as reinvested in the index at least as frequently as the end of each calendar quarter following the payment of the dividend.

Change in index value for 1971: 102.09 − 92.15 = 9.94. Accumulated value of dividends for 1971:![](/graphics/ec14no91.094.gif)

Aggregate value of dividends paid, assuming quarterly reinvestment and computed consistently with the index:

(Percent yield as computed above) × (ending index value) = Aggregate value of dividends paid

For 1971:

.0314 × 102.09 = 3.21

The same method can be extended to cases where an investment company's fiscal quarters do not coincide with the fiscal quarters of the S & P dividend record or to instances where a “rolling period” is used for performance comparisons as indicated by the following example of the calculation of the investment record of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Composite Index for the 12 months ended November 1971:

|Index value Nov. 30, 1971|93.99|

Accumulated value of dividends reinvested:

December = 1.0028

January-March = 1.0078

April-June = 1.0078

July-September = 1.0079

October-November = 1.0053 4

4 The rate for October and November would be two-thirds of the yield for the quarter ended Sept. 30 (i.e. .667 × .79 = 5269) since the yield for the quarter ended Dec. 31 would not be available as of Nov. 30.

Dividend yield:

(1.0028 × 1.0078 × 1.0078 × 1.0079 × 1.0053) − 1.00 = .0320

Aggregate value of dividends paid computed consistently with the index:

.0320 × 93.99 = 3.01

The same method can be extended to cases where an investment company's fiscal quarters do not coincide with the fiscal quarters of the NYSE dividend record or to instances where a “rolling period” is used for performance comparisons as indicated by the following example of the calculation of the investment record of the NYSE Composite Index for the 12 months ended November 1971:

|Index value Nov. 30, 1971|51.84|
|-------------------------|-----|
|Index value Nov. 30, 1970|47.41|
|  Change in index value  |4.43 |

|Quarter ending|Dividend yield quarterly percent|Rate for each month of quarter (1/12 of annual)\>|
|--------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|  Dec. 1970   |              0.79              |                      0.26                       |
|  Mar. 1971   |              .72               |                       .24                       |

|  Sept. 1971  |              .71               |                       .24                       |

Accumulated value of dividends reinvested:

December = 1.0026

January-March = 1.0072

April-June = 1.0070

July-September = 1.0071

October-November = 1.0047 4

4 The rate for October and November would be two thirds of the yield for the quarter ended September 30 (i.e. .667 × .71 = 4736), since the yield for the quarter ended December 31 would not be available as of November 30.

Dividend yield:

(1.0026 × 1.0072 × 1.0070 × 1.0071 × 1.0047) − 1.00 = .0289

Aggregate value of dividends paid computed consistently with the index:

.0289 × 51.84 = 1.50
