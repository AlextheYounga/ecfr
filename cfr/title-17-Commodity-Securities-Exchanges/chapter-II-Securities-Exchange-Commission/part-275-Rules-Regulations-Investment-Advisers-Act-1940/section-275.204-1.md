##### § 275.204-1 Amendments to Form ADV. #####

(a) *When amendment is required.* You must amend your Form ADV (17 CFR 279.1):

(1) At least annually, within 90 days of the end of your fiscal year; and

(2) More frequently, if required by the instructions to Form ADV.

(b) *Electronic filing of amendments.* (1) You must file all amendments to Part 1A of Form ADV and Part 2A of Form ADV electronically with the IARD, unless you have received a continuing hardship exemption under § 275.203-3. You are not required to file with the Commission amendments to brochure supplements required by Part 2B of Form ADV.

(2) If you have received a continuing hardship exemption under § 275.203-3, you must, when you are required to amend your Form ADV, file a completed Part 1A and Part 2A of Form ADV on paper with the SEC by mailing it to FINRA.

Note to paragraphs (a) and (b):

Information on how to file with the IARD is available on our Web site at *http://www.sec.gov/iard.* For the annual updating amendment: Summaries of material changes that are not included in the adviser's brochure must be filed with the Commission as an exhibit to Part 2A in the same electronic file; and if you are not required to prepare a brochure, a summary of material changes, or an annual updating amendment to your brochure, you are not required to file them with the Commission. See the instructions for Part 2A of Form ADV.

(c) *Filing fees.* You must pay FINRA (the operator of the IARD) an initial filing fee when you first electronically file Part 1A of Form ADV. After you pay the initial filing fee, you must pay an annual filing fee each time you file your annual updating amendment. No portion of either fee is refundable. The Commission has approved the filing fees. Your amended Form ADV will not be accepted by FINRA, and thus will not be considered filed with the Commission, until you have paid the filing fee.

(d) *Amendments to Form ADV are reports.* Each amendment required to be filed under this section is a “report” within the meaning of sections 204 and 207 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 80b-4 and 80b-7).
