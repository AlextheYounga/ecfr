(2) Provide information regarding the portfolio holdings or exposures of the private fund, or of a similar pool of assets, to any investor in the private fund if the adviser reasonably expects that providing the information would have a material, negative effect on other investors in that private fund or in a similar pool of assets, except if the investment adviser offers such information to all other existing investors in the private fund and any similar pool of assets at the same time or substantially the same time.
