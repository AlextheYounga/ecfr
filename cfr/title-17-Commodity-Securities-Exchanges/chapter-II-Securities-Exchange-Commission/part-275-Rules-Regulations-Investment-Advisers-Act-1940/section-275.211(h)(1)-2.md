(b) *Fund table.* The quarterly statement must include a table for the private fund that discloses, at a minimum, the following information, presented both before and after the application of any offsets, rebates, or waivers for the information required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section:

(2) A detailed accounting of all fees and expenses allocated to or paid by the private fund during the reporting period (other than those listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section), with separate line items for each category of fee or expense reflecting the total dollar amount, including, but not limited to, organizational, accounting, legal, administration, audit, tax, due diligence, and travel fees and expenses; and

(3) The amount of any offsets or rebates carried forward during the reporting period to subsequent periods to reduce future payments or allocations to the adviser or its related persons.

(c) *Portfolio investment table.* The quarterly statement must include a separate table for the private fund's covered portfolio investments that discloses, at a minimum, the following information for each covered portfolio investment: a detailed accounting of all portfolio investment compensation allocated or paid to the investment adviser or any of its related persons by the covered portfolio investment during the reporting period, with separate line items for each category of allocation or payment reflecting the total dollar amount, presented both before and after the application of any offsets, rebates, or waivers.

(d) *Calculations and cross-references.* The quarterly statement must include prominent disclosure regarding the manner in which all expenses, payments, allocations, rebates, waivers, and offsets are calculated and include cross references to the sections of the private fund's organizational and offering documents that set forth the applicable calculation methodology.

(e) *Performance.* (1) No later than the time the adviser sends the initial quarterly statement, the adviser must determine that the private fund is an illiquid fund or a liquid fund.

(2) The quarterly statement must present the following with equal prominence:

(i) *Liquid funds.* For a liquid fund:

(A) Annual net total returns for each fiscal year over the past 10 fiscal years or since inception, whichever time period is shorter;

(B) Average annual net total returns over the one-, five-, and 10-fiscal-year periods; and

(C) The cumulative net total return for the current fiscal year as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter covered by the quarterly statement.

(ii) *Illiquid funds.* For an illiquid fund:

(A) The following performance measures, shown since inception of the illiquid fund through the end of the quarter covered by the quarterly statement (or, to the extent quarter-end numbers are not available at the time the adviser distributes the quarterly statement, through the most recent practicable date) and computed with and without the impact of any fund-level subscription facilities:

(*1*) Gross IRR and gross MOIC for the illiquid fund;

(*2*) Net IRR and net MOIC for the illiquid fund; and

(*3*) Gross IRR and gross MOIC for the realized and unrealized portions of the illiquid fund's portfolio, with the realized and unrealized performance shown separately.

(B) A statement of contributions and distributions for the illiquid fund.

(iii) *Other matters.* The quarterly statement must include the date as of which the performance information is current through and prominent disclosure of the criteria used and assumptions made in calculating the performance.

(f) *Consolidated reporting.* To the extent doing so would provide more meaningful information to the private fund's investors and would not be misleading, the adviser must consolidate the reporting required by paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section to cover *similar pools of assets.*

(g) *Format and content.* The quarterly statement must use clear, concise, plain English and be presented in a format that facilitates review from one quarterly statement to the next.
