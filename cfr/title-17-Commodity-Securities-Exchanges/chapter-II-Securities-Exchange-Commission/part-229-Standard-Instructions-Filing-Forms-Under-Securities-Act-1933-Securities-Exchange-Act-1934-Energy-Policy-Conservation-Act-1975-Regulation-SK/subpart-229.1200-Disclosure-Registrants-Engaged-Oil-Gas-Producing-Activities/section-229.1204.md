##### § 229.1204 (Item 1204) Oil and gas production, production prices and production costs. #####

(a) For each of the last three fiscal years disclose production, by final product sold, of oil, gas, and other products. Disclosure shall be made by geographical area and for each country and field that contains 15% or more of the registrant's total proved reserves expressed on an oil-equivalent-barrels basis unless prohibited by the country in which the reserves are located.

(b) For each of the last three fiscal years disclose, by geographical area:

(1) The average sales price (including transfers) per unit of oil, gas and other products produced; and

(2) The average production cost, not including ad valorem and severance taxes, per unit of production.

*Instruction 1 to Item 1204:* Generally, net production should include only production that is owned by the registrant and produced to its interest, less royalties and production due others. However, in special situations (e.g., foreign production) net production before any royalties may be provided, if more appropriate. If “net before royalty” production figures are furnished, the change from the usage of “net production” should be noted.

*Instruction 2 to Item 1204:* Production of natural gas should include only marketable production of natural gas on an “as sold” basis. Production will include dry, residue, and wet gas, depending on whether liquids have been extracted before the registrant transfers title. Flared gas, injected gas, and gas consumed in operations should be omitted. Recovered gas-lift gas and reproduced gas should not be included until sold. Synthetic gas, when marketed as such, should be included in natural gas sales.

*Instruction 3 to Item 1204:* If any product, such as bitumen, is sold or custody is transferred prior to conversion to synthetic oil or gas, the product's production, transfer prices, and production costs should be disclosed separately from all other products.

*Instruction 4 to Item 1204:* The transfer price of oil and gas (natural and synthetic) produced should be determined in accordance with FASB ASC paragraph 932-235-50-24 (Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas Topic).

*Instruction 5 to Item 1204:* The average production cost, not including ad valorem and severance taxes, per unit of production should be computed using production costs disclosed pursuant to FASB ASC Topic 932, *Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas.* Units of production should be expressed in common units of production with oil, gas, and other products converted to a common unit of measure on the basis used in computing amortization.
