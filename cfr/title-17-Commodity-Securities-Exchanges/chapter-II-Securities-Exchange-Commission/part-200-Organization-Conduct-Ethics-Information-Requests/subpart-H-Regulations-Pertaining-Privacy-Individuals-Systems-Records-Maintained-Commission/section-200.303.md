##### § 200.303 Times, places and requirements for requests pertaining to individual records in a record system and for the identification of individuals making requests for access to the records pertaining to them. #####

(a) *Place to make request.* Any request by an individual to be advised whether any system of records maintained by the Commission and named by the individual contains a record pertaining to him or her, or any request by an individual for access to a record pertaining to him or her that is contained in a system of records maintained by the Commission, shall be submitted by mail to the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, or by facsimile (202-772-9337). All requests will be required to be put in writing and signed by the individual making the request. In the case of requests for access that are made by mail, the envelope should be clearly marked “Privacy Act Request.”

(1) *Information to be included in requests.* Each request by an individual concerning whether the Commission maintains in a system of records a record that pertains to him, or for access to any record pertaining to the individual that is maintained by the Commission in a system of records, shall include such information as will assist the Commission in identifying those records as to which the individual is seeking information or access. Where practicable, the individual should identify the system of records that is the subject of his request by reference to the Commission's notices of systems of records, which are published in the Federal Register, as required by section (e)(4) of the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4). Where a system of records is compiled on the basis of a specific identification scheme, the individual should include in his request the identification number or other identifier assigned to him. In the event the individual does not know the specific identifier assigned to him, he shall provide other information, including his full name, address, date of birth and subject matter of the record, to aid in processing his request. If additional information is required before a request can be processed, the individual shall be so advised.

(2) *Verification of identity.* When the fact of the existence of a record is not required to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, or when a record as to which access has been requested is not required to be disclosed under that Act, the individual seeking the information or requesting access to the record shall be required to verify his or her identity before access will be granted or information given. For this purpose, individuals shall appear at the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, during normal business hours of 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. E.S.T., Monday through Friday, or at one of the Commission's Regional Offices.

Requests will be processed as promptly as possible and a response to such requests will be given within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) unless, within the 30 day period and for cause shown, the individual making the request is notified in writing that a longer period is necessary.

(2) When an individual appears in person at the Office of Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Operations, SEC, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, or at one of its Regional Offices to request access to records pertaining to him, and such individual provides the required information and verification of identity, the Commission's staff, if practicable, will indicate at that time whether it is likely that the individual will be given access to the records and, if so, when and under what circumstances such access will be given. In the case of requests received by mail, whenever practicable, acknowledgement of the receipt of the request will be given within 10 days after receipt (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays). The acknowledgement will indicate, if practicable, whether or not access likely will be granted and, if so, when and under what circumstances.
