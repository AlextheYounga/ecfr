Note:

The Commission intends, to the extent convenient, to adhere to the following schedule in organizing its weekly agenda: Closed meetings to consider matters concerning the enforcement of the federal securities laws and the conduct of related investigations will generally be held on Tuesdays and on Thursday afternoons. An open meeting will generally be held each Thursday morning to consider matters of any appropriate nature. On Wednesdays, either open or closed meetings, or both, will generally be held according to the requirements of the Commission's agenda for the week in question. Normally, no meetings will be scheduled on Mondays, Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays.

The foregoing tentative general schedule is set forth for the guidance of the public, but is not, in any event, binding upon the Commission. In every case, the scheduling of Commission meetings shall be determined by the demands of Commission business, consistent with the requirements of this subpart I. When feasible, the Commission will endeavor to announce the subject matter of all then-contemplated open meetings during a particular month at least one week prior to the commencement of that month.

When and if convenient after the conclusion of a closed Commission meeting, the Commission will endeavor to make publicly available a notice describing (subject to the provision in ยง 200.402(d) regarding nonpublic matter in announcements) the items considered at that meeting and any action taken thereon.
