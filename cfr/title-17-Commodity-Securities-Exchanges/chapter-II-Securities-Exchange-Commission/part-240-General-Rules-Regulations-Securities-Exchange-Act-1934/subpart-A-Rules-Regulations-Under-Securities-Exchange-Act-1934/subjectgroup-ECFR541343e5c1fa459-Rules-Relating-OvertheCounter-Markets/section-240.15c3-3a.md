Notes Regarding the Customer Reserve Bank Account Computation

Note A. Item 1 must include all outstanding drafts payable to customers which have been applied against free credit balances or other credit balances and must also include checks drawn in excess of bank balances per the records of the broker or dealer.

Note B. Item 2 must include the amount of options-related or security futures product-related Letters of Credit obtained by a member of a registered clearing agency or a derivatives clearing organization which are collateralized by customers' securities, to the extent of the member's margin requirement at the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization. Item 2 must also include the amount of Letters of Credit which are collateralized by customers' securities and related to other futures contracts (and options thereon) carried in a securities account pursuant to an SRO portfolio margining rule. Item 2 must include the market value of customers' securities on deposit at a “qualified clearing agency” as defined in Note H below.

Note C. Item 3 must include in addition to monies payable against customers' securities loaned the amount by which the market value of securities loaned exceeds the collateral value received from the lending of such securities.

Note D. Item 4 must include in addition to customers' securities failed to receive the amount by which the market value of securities failed to receive and outstanding more than thirty (30) calendar days exceeds their contract value.

Note E. (1) Debit balances in margin accounts must be reduced by the amount by which a specific security (other than an exempted security) which is collateral for margin accounts exceeds in aggregate value 15 percent of the aggregate value of all securities which collateralize all margin accounts receivable; provided, however, the required reduction must not be in excess of the amounts of the debit balance required to be excluded because of this concentration rule. A specified security is deemed to be collateral for a margin account only to the extent it represents in value not more than 140 percent of the customer debit balance in a margin account.

(2) Debit balances in special omnibus accounts, maintained in compliance with the requirements of Section 7(f) of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.7(f)) or similar accounts carried on behalf of another broker or dealer, must be reduced by any deficits in such accounts (or if a credit, such credit must be increased) less any calls for margin, mark to the market, or other required deposits which are outstanding five business days or less.

(3) Debit balances in customers' cash and margin accounts included in the formula under Item 10 must be reduced by an amount equal to 1 percent of their aggregate value.

(4) Debit balances in cash and margin accounts of household members and other persons related to principals of a broker or dealer and debit balances in cash and margin accounts of affiliated persons of a broker or dealer must be excluded from the Reserve Formula, unless the broker or dealer can demonstrate that such debit balances are directly related to credit items in the formula.

(5) Debit balances in margin accounts (other than omnibus accounts) must be reduced by the amount by which any single customer's debit balance exceeds 25 percent (to the extent such amount is greater than $50,000) of the broker-dealer's tentative net capital (*i.e.,* net capital prior to securities haircuts) unless the broker or dealer can demonstrate that the debit balance is directly related to credit items in the Reserve Formula. Related accounts (*e.g.,* the separate accounts of an individual, accounts under common control or subject to cross guarantees) will be deemed to be a single customer's accounts for purposes of this provision. If the registered national securities exchange or the registered national securities association having responsibility for examining the broker or dealer (“designated examining authority”) is satisfied, after taking into account the circumstances of the concentrated account including the quality, diversity, and marketability of the collateral securing the debit balances or margin accounts subject to this provision, that the concentration of debit balances is appropriate, then such designated examining authority may grant a partial or plenary exception from this provision. The debit balance may be included in the reserve formula computation for five business days from the day the request is made.

(6) Debit balances in joint accounts, custodian accounts, participation in hedge funds or limited partnerships or similar type accounts or arrangements that include both assets of a person or persons who would be excluded from the definition of customer (“noncustomer”) and assets of a person or persons who would be included in the definition of customer must be included in the Reserve Formula in the following manner: if the percentage ownership of the non-customer is less than 5 percent then the entire debit balance shall be included in the formula; if such percentage ownership is between 5 percent and 50 percent then the portion of the debit balance attributable to the non-customer must be excluded from the formula unless the broker or dealer can demonstrate that the debit balance is directly related to credit items in the formula; or if such percentage ownership is greater than 50 percent, then the entire debit balance must be excluded from the formula unless the broker or dealer can demonstrate that the debit balance is directly related to credit items in the formula.

Note F. Item 13 must include the amount of margin required and on deposit with the Options Clearing Corporation to the extent such margin is represented by cash, proprietary qualified securities and letters of credit collateralized by customers' securities.

Note G. (a) Item 14 must include the amount of margin required and on deposit with a clearing agency registered with the Commission under section 17A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) or a derivatives clearing organization registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under section 5b of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 7a-1) for customer accounts to the extent that the margin is represented by cash, proprietary qualified securities, and letters of credit collateralized by customers' securities.

(b) Item 14 will apply only if the broker or dealer has the margin related to security futures products, or futures (and options thereon) carried in a securities account pursuant to an approved SRO portfolio margining program on deposit with:

(1) A registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization that:

(i) Maintains security deposits from clearing members in connection with regulated options or futures transactions and assessment power over member firms that equal a combined total of at least $2 billion, at least $500 million of which must be in the form of security deposits. For the purposes of this Note G, the term “security deposits” refers to a general fund, other than margin deposits or their equivalent, that consists of cash or securities held by a registered clearing agency or derivative clearing organization; or

(ii) Maintains at least $3 billion in margin deposits; or

(iii) Does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this Note G, if the Commission has determined, upon a written request for exemption by or for the benefit of the broker or dealer, that the broker or dealer may utilize such a registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization. The Commission may, in its sole discretion, grant such an exemption subject to such conditions as are appropriate under the circumstances, if the Commission determines that such conditional or unconditional exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors; and

(2) A registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization that, if it holds funds or securities deposited as margin for security futures products or futures in a portfolio margin account in a bank, as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6)), obtains and preserves written notification from the bank at which it holds such funds and securities or at which such funds and securities are held on its behalf. The written notification will state that all funds and/or securities deposited with the bank as margin (including customer security futures products and futures in a portfolio margin account), or held by the bank and pledged to such registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing agency as margin, are being held by the bank for the exclusive benefit of clearing members of the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization (subject to the interest of such registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization therein), and are being kept separate from any other accounts maintained by the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization with the bank. The written notification also will provide that such funds and/or securities will at no time be used directly or indirectly as security for a loan to the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization by the bank, and will be subject to no right, charge, security interest, lien, or claim of any kind in favor of the bank or any person claiming through the bank. This provision, however, will not prohibit a registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization from pledging customer funds or securities as collateral to a bank for any purpose that the rules of the Commission or the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization otherwise permit; and

(3) A registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization establishes, documents, and maintains:

(i) Safeguards in the handling, transfer, and delivery of cash and securities;

(ii) Fidelity bond coverage for its employees and agents who handle customer funds or securities. In the case of agents of a registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization, the agent may provide the fidelity bond coverage; and

(iii) Provisions for periodic examination by independent public accountants; and

(iv) A derivatives clearing organization that, if it is not otherwise registered with the Commission, has provided the Commission with a written undertaking, in a form acceptable to the Commission, executed by a duly authorized person at the derivatives clearing organization, to the effect that, with respect to the clearance and settlement of the customer security futures products and futures in a portfolio margin account of the broker or dealer, the derivatives clearing organization will permit the Commission to examine the books and records of the derivatives clearing organization for compliance with the requirements set forth in § 240.15c3-3a, Note G (b)(1) through (3).

(c) Item 14 will apply only if a broker or dealer determines, at least annually, that the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization with which the broker or dealer has on deposit margin related to securities future products or futures in a portfolio margin account meets the conditions of this Note G.

Note H. (a) Item 15 must include the amount of margin required and on deposit with a clearing agency registered with the Commission under section 17A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1) that clears, settles, and novates transactions in U.S. Treasury securities (“qualified clearing agency”) to the extent that the margin is:

(1) In the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities, or qualified customer securities; and

(2) Being used to margin U.S. Treasury securities positions of the customers of the broker or dealer that are cleared, settled, and novated by the qualified clearing agency.

(b) Item 15 will apply only if the cash and securities required and on deposit at the qualified clearing agency:

(1)(i) Are cash owed by the broker or dealer to the customer of the broker or dealer that was delivered by the broker or dealer to the qualified clearing agency to meet a margin requirement resulting from that customer's U.S. Treasury securities positions cleared, settled, and novated at the qualified clearing agency and not for any other customer's or the broker's or dealer's U.S. Treasury securities positions cleared, settled, and novated at the qualified clearing agency;

(ii) U.S. Treasury securities or qualified customer securities held in custody by the broker or dealer for the customer of the broker or dealer that were delivered by the broker or dealer to the qualified clearing agency to meet a margin requirement resulting from that customer's U.S. Treasury securities positions cleared, settled, and novated at the qualified clearing agency and not for any other customer's or the broker's or dealer's U.S. Treasury securities positions cleared, settled, and novated at the qualified clearing agency; or

(iii) U.S. Treasury securities owned by the broker or dealer that were delivered by the broker or dealer to the qualified clearing agency to meet a margin requirement resulting from a customer's U.S. Treasury securities positions cleared, settled, and novated at the qualified clearing agency under the following conditions:

(A) The broker or dealer did not owe to the customer or hold in custody for the customer sufficient cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and/or qualified customer securities to meet a margin requirement resulting from that customer's U.S. Treasury securities positions cleared, settled, and novated at the qualified clearing agency at the time the margin requirement arose;

(B) The broker or dealer calls for the customer to deliver a sufficient amount of cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and/or qualified customer securities to meet the margin requirement on the day the margin requirement arose; and

(C) The broker or dealer receives a sufficient amount of cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and/or qualified customer securities to meet the margin requirement by the close of the next business day after the margin requirement arose.

(2) Are treated in accordance with rules of the qualified clearing agency that impose the following requirements and the qualified clearing agency and broker or dealer are in compliance with the requirements of the rules (as applicable):

(i) Rules requiring the qualified clearing agency to calculate a separate margin amount for each customer of the broker or dealer and the broker or dealer to deliver that amount of margin for each customer on a gross basis;

(ii) Rules limiting the qualified clearing agency from investing cash delivered by the broker or dealer to margin U.S. Treasury security transactions of the customers of the broker or dealer or cash realized through using U.S. Treasury securities delivered by the broker or dealer for that purpose in any asset other than U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity of one year or less;

(iii) Rules requiring that the cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and qualified customer securities used to margin the U.S. Treasury securities positions of the customers of the broker or dealer be held in an account of the broker or dealer at the qualified clearing agency that is segregated from any other account of the broker or dealer at the qualified clearing agency and that is:

(A) Used exclusively to clear, settle, novate, and margin U.S. Treasury securities transactions of the customers of the broker or dealer;

(D) Subject to a written contract between the broker or dealer and the qualified clearing agency which provides that the cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and qualified customer securities in the account are not available to cover claims arising from the broker or dealer or any other clearing member defaulting on an obligation to the qualified clearing agency or subject to any other right, charge, security interest, lien, or claim of any kind in favor of the qualified clearing agency or any person claiming through the qualified clearing agency, except a right, charge, security interest, lien, or claim resulting from a cleared U.S. Treasury securities transaction of a customer of the broker or dealer effected in the account;

(iv) Rules requiring the qualified clearing agency to hold the customer cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and qualified customer securities used to margin the U.S. Treasury securities positions of the customers of the broker or dealer itself or in an account of the clearing agency at a U.S. Federal Reserve Bank or a “bank,” as that term is defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6)), that is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and that the account at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank or bank must be:

(A) Segregated from any other account of the qualified clearing agency or any other person at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank or bank and used exclusively to hold cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and qualified customer securities to meet current margin requirements of the qualified clearing agency resulting from positions in U.S. Treasury securities of the customers of the broker or dealer members of the qualified clearing agency;

(B) Subject to a written notice of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank or bank provided to and retained by the qualified clearing agency that the cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and qualified customer securities in the account are being held by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank or bank pursuant to § 240.15c3-3 and are being kept separate from any other accounts maintained by the qualified clearing agency or any other person at the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank or bank; and

(v) Rules requiring systems, controls, policies, and procedures to return cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and qualified customer securities to the broker or dealer that are no longer needed to meet a current margin requirement resulting from positions in U.S. Treasury securities of the customers of the broker or dealer; and

(3) The Commission has approved rules of the qualified clearing agency that meet the conditions of this Note H and has published (and not subsequently withdrawn) a notice that brokers or dealers may include a debit in the customer reserve formula when depositing cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and/or qualified customer securities to meet a margin requirement of the qualified clearing agency resulting from positions in U.S. Treasury securities of the customers of the broker or dealer.

(c) As used in this Note H, the term “qualified customer securities” means the securities of a customer of the broker or dealer (other than U.S. Treasury securities) that are held in custody by the broker or dealer for the customer and that under the rules of the qualified clearing agency are eligible to be used to margin U.S. Treasury securities positions of the customer that are cleared, settled, and novated by the qualified clearing agency.

Notes Regarding the PAB Reserve Bank Account Computation

Note 1. Broker-dealers should use the formula in Exhibit A for the purposes of computing the PAB reserve requirement, except that references to “accounts,” “customer accounts, or “customers” will be treated as references to PAB accounts.

Note 2. Any credit (including a credit applied to reduce a debit) that is included in the computation required by § 240.15c3-3 with respect to customer accounts (the “customer reserve computation”) may not be included as a credit in the computation required by § 240.15c3-3 with respect to PAB accounts (the “PAB reserve computation”).

Note 3. Note E(1) to § 240.15c3-3a does not apply to the PAB reserve computation.

Note 4. Note E(3) to § 240.15c3-3a which reduces debit balances by 1 percent does not apply to the PAB reserve computation.

Note 5. Interest receivable, floor brokerage, and commissions receivable of another broker or dealer from the broker or dealer (excluding clearing deposits) that are otherwise allowable assets under § 240.15c3-1 need not be included in the PAB reserve computation, provided the amounts have been clearly identified as payables on the books of the broker or dealer. Commissions receivable and other receivables of another broker or dealer from the broker or dealer that are otherwise non-allowable assets under § 240.15c3-1 and clearing deposits of another broker or dealer may be included as “credit balances” for purposes of the PAB reserve computation, provided the commissions receivable and other receivables are subject to immediate cash payment to the other broker or dealer and the clearing deposit is subject to payment within 30 days.

Note 6. Credits included in the PAB reserve computation that result from the use of securities held for a PAB account (“PAB securities”) that are pledged to meet intra-day margin calls in a cross-margin account established between the Options Clearing Corporation and any regulated derivatives clearing organization may be reduced to the extent that the excess margin held by the other clearing corporation in the cross-margin relationship is used the following business day to replace the PAB securities that were previously pledged. In addition, balances resulting from a portfolio margin account that are segregated pursuant to Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations need not be included in the PAB Reserve Bank Account computation.

Note 7. Deposits received prior to a transaction pending settlement which are $5 million or greater for any single transaction or $10 million in aggregate may be excluded as credits from the PAB reserve computation if such balances are placed and maintained in a separate PAB Reserve Bank Account by 12 p.m. Eastern Time on the following business day. Thereafter, the money representing any such deposits may be withdrawn to complete the related transactions without performing a new PAB reserve computation.

Note 8. A credit balance resulting from a PAB reserve computation may be reduced by the amount that items representing such credits are swept into money market funds or mutual funds of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 on or prior to 10 a.m. Eastern Time on the deposit date provided that the credits swept into any such fund are not subject to any right, charge, security interest, lien, or claim of any kind in favor of the investment company or the broker or dealer. Any credits that have been swept into money market funds or mutual funds must be maintained in the name of a particular broker or for the benefit of another broker.

Note 9. Clearing deposits required to be maintained at registered clearing agencies may be included as debits in the PAB reserve computation to the extent the percentage of the deposit, which is based upon the clearing agency's aggregate deposit requirements (*e.g.,* dollar trading volume), that relates to the proprietary business of other brokers and dealers can be identified. However, Note H to Item 15 of § 240.15c3-3a applies with respect to margin delivered to a U.S. Treasury securities clearing agency.

Note 10. A broker or dealer that clears PAB accounts through an affiliate or third party clearing broker must include these PAB account balances and the omnibus PAB account balance in its PAB reserve computation.
