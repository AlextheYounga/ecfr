Eligibility Requirements for Use of Schedule 14D-1F

A. Schedule 14D-1F may be used by any person making a cash tender or exchange offer (the “bidder”) for securities of any issuer incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any Canadian province or territory that is a foreign private issuer, where less than 40 percent of the outstanding class of such issuer's securities that is the subject of the offer is held by U.S. holders. The calculation of U.S. holders shall be made as of the end of the subject issuer's last quarter or, if such quarter terminated within 60 days of the filing date, as of the end of such issuer's preceding quarter.

Instructions

1. For purposes of this Schedule, “foreign private issuer” shall be construed in accordance with Rule 405 under the Securities Act.

2. For purposes of this Schedule, the term “U. S. holder” shall mean any person whose address appears on the records of the issuer, any voting trustee, any depositary, any share transfer agent or any person acting in a similar capacity on behalf of the issuer as being located in the United States.

3. With respect to any tender offer, including any exchange offer, otherwise eligible to proceed in accordance with Rule 14d-1(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), the issuer of the subject securities will be presumed to be a foreign private issuer and U. S. holders will be presumed to hold less than 40 percent of such outstanding securities, unless (a) the aggregate trading volume of that class on national securities exchanges in the United States and on NASDAQ exceeded its aggregate trading volume on securities exchanges in Canada and on the Canadian Dealing Network, Inc. (“CDN”) over the 12 calendar month period prior to commencement of this offer, or if commenced in response to a prior offer, over the 12 calendar month period prior to commencement of the initial offer (based on volume figures published by such exchanges and NASDAQ and CDN) ; (b) the most recent annual report or annual information form filed or submitted by the issuer with securities regulators of Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia or Alberta (or, if the issuer of the subject securities is not a reporting issuer in any of such provinces, with any other Canadian securities regulator) or with the Commission indicates that U. S. holders hold 40 percent or more of the subject class of securities; or (c) the offeror has actual knowledge that the level of U. S. ownership equals or exceeds 40 percent of such securities.

4. If this Schedule is filed during the pendency of one or more ongoing cash tender or exchange offers for securities of the class subject to this offer that was commenced or was eligible to be commenced on Schedule 13E-4F, Schedule 14D-1F and/or Form F-8 or Form F-80, the date for calculation of U. S. ownership for purposes of this Schedule shall be the same as that date used by the initial bidder or issuer.

5. For purposes of this Schedule, the class of subject securities shall not include any securities that may be converted into or are exchangeable for the subject securities.

B. Any bidder using this Schedule must extend the cash tender or exchange offer to U. S. holders of securities of the subject company upon terms and conditions not less favorable than those extended to any other holder of such securities, and must comply with the requirements of any Canadian federal, provincial and/or territorial law, regulation or policy relating to the terms and conditions of the offer.

C. This Schedule shall not be used if the subject company is an investment company registered or required to be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

D. This Schedule shall not be used to comply with the reporting requirements of section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. Persons using this Schedule are reminded of their obligation to file or update a Schedule 13D where required by section 13(d)(1) of the Exchange Act and the Commission's rules and regulations thereunder.

“This tender offer is made for the securities of a foreign issuer and while the offer is subject to disclosure requirements of the country in which the subject company is incorporated or organized, investors should be aware that these requirements are different from those of the United States. Financial statements included herein, if any, have been prepared in accordance with foreign generally accepted accounting principles and thus may not be comparable to financial statements of United States companies.

“The enforcement by investors of civil liabilities under the federal securities laws may be affected adversely by the fact that the subject company is located in a foreign country, and that some or all of its officers and directors are residents of a foreign country.

“Investors should be aware that the bidder or its affiliates, directly or indirectly, may bid for or make purchases of the issuer's securities subject to the offer, or of the issuer's related securities, during the period of the tender offer, as permitted by applicable Canadian laws or provincial laws or regulations. ”

“Investors should be aware that the bidder or its affiliates, directly or indirectly, may bid for or make purchases of the issuer's securities subject to the offer or of the issuer's related securities, or of the bidder's securities to be distributed or of the bidder's related securities, during the period of the tender offer, as permitted by applicable Canadian laws or provincial laws or regulations. ”

Note to Item 2.

If the home-jurisdiction document(s) are delivered through an electronic medium, the issuer may satisfy the legibility requirements for the required legends relating to type size and font by presenting the legend in any manner reasonably calculated to draw security holder attention to it.
