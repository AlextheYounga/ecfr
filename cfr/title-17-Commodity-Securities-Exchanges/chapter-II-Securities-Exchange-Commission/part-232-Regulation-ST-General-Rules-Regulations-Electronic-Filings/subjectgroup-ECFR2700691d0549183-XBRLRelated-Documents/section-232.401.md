(ii) That the purpose of submitting the XBRL-Related Documents is to test the related format and technology and, as a result, investors should not rely on the XBRL-Related Documents in making investment decisions; and

Note to § 232.401:

Although XBRL-Related Documents are required by this section to comply with content and format requirements related to the corresponding official EDGAR filing, the purpose of submitting the XBRL-Related Documents is to test the related format and technology and, as a result, investors and others should continue to rely on the official version of the filing and not rely on the XBRL-Related Documents in making investment decisions.
