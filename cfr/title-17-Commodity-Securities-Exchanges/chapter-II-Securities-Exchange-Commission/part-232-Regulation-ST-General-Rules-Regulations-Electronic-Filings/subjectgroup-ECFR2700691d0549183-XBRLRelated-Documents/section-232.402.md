(1) Are not deemed filed for purposes of section 11 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77k), section 18 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78r), or section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act (15 U.S.C. 80a-33(b)), or otherwise subject to the liabilities of these sections, and are not part of any registration statement to which they relate;

(2) Are not deemed incorporated by reference;

(b) *Accurate reflection of underlying documents.* An electronic filer is not liable under the Securities Act, Exchange Act, Trust Indenture Act or Investment Company Act for information in its XBRL-Related Documents that complies with the requirements of Rule 401 of Regulation S-T (§ 232.401) to the extent that such information was not materially false or misleading in the corresponding official EDGAR filing. To the extent the information in an electronic filer's XBRL-Related Documents does not comply with the requirements of Rule 401, the information in the XBRL-Related Documents will be deemed to comply with Rule 401 for purposes of this paragraph if the electronic filer makes a good faith and reasonable attempt to comply with Rule 401 and, as soon as reasonably practicable after the electronic filer becomes aware that the information in the XBRL-Related Documents does not comply with Rule 401, the electronic filer amends the XBRL-Related Documents and, as a result, the information complies with Rule 401.
