##### § 232.10 Application of part 232. #####

(a) This part, in conjunction with the EDGAR Filer Manual and the electronic filing provisions of applicable rules, regulations and forms, shall govern the electronic submission of documents filed or otherwise submitted to the Commission and shall be controlling for an electronic format document in the manner and respects provided in this part.

(b) Each registrant, third party filer, or agent to whom the Commission previously has not assigned a Central Index Key (CIK) code, must, before filing on EDGAR:

(1) File electronically the information required by Form ID (§§ 239.63, 249.446, 269.7 and 274.402 of this chapter), the uniform application form for access codes to file on EDGAR, and

(2) File, by uploading as a Portable Document Format (PDF) attachment to the Form ID filing, a notarized document, manually signed by the applicant over the applicant's typed signature, that includes the information required to be included in the Form ID filing and confirms the authenticity of the Form ID filing.

(c) Temporary relief from Form ID notarization requirement is provided as follows:

(1) An applicant subject to the notarization requirement under paragraph (b) of this section who is unable to obtain the notarization due to circumstances relating to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may upload the manually signed PDF copy of the attachment to the Form ID filing without the notarization *provided that* the applicant indicates on the face of the signed document that the applicant could not provide the required notarization due to circumstances relating to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

(2) Commission staff will issue codes necessary to file on the EDGAR system in the cases described in paragraph (c)(1) from March 26, 2020, to July 1, 2020, to allow filers to proceed with required electronic filings. The required notarized document must be submitted as correspondence via EDGAR within 90 days of EDGAR codes issuance; if it is not, the Commission staff is authorized to inactivate the filer's EDGAR codes.

(3) The Commission or its staff may inactivate or terminate codes issued under this paragraph (c) if the staff has reason to believe that such action is necessary for the protection of investors.

Note to § 232.10:

The Commission strongly urges any person or entity about to become subject to the disclosure and filing requirements of the federal securities laws to submit a Form ID well in advance of the first required filing, including a registration statement relating to an initial public offering, in order to facilitate electronic filing on a timely basis.
