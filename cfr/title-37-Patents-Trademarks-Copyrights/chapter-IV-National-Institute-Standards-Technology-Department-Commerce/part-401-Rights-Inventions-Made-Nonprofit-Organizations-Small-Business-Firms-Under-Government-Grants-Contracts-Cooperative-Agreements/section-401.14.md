(b) Allocation of Principal Rights

The *Contractor* may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the *Contractor* retains title, the Federal government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world.

(c) Invention Disclosure, Election of Title and Filing of Patent Application by *Contractor*

(1) The *contractor* will disclose each subject invention to the *Federal Agency* within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to *contractor* personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the *contract* under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the *agency,* the *Contractor* will promptly notify the *agency* of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any on sale or public use planned by the *contractor.*

(2) The *contractor* will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying the *Federal agency* within two years of disclosure to the *Federal agency*. However, in any case where a patent, a printed publication, public use, sale, or other availability to the public has initiated the one year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the *agency* to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.

(3) The *contractor* will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. If the *contractor* files a provisional application as its initial patent application, it shall file a non-provisional application within 10 months of the filing of the provisional application. The *contractor* will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either ten months of the first filed patent application or six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.

(4) For any subject invention with *Federal agency* and *contractor* co-inventors, where the *Federal agency* employing such co-inventor determines that it would be in the interest of the government, pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 207(a)(3), to file an initial patent application on the subject invention, the *Federal agency* employing such co-inventor, at its discretion and in consultation with the *contractor,* may file such application at its own expense, provided that the *contractor* retains the ability to elect title pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 202(a).

(5) Requests for extension of the time for disclosure, election, and filing under paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this clause may, at the discretion of the *Federal agency,* be granted. When a *contractor* has requested an extension for filing a non-provisional application after filing a provisional application, a one-year extension will be granted unless the *Federal agency* notifies the *contractor* within 60 days of receiving the request.

(d) Conditions When the Government May Obtain Title

The *contractor* will convey to the *Federal agency,* upon written request, title to any subject invention -

(1) If the *contractor* fails to disclose or elect title to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, or elects not to retain title.

(2) In those countries in which the *contractor* fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause; provided, however, that if the *contractor* has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the *Federal agency,* the *contractor* shall continue to retain title in that country.

(3) In any country in which the *contractor* decides not to continue the prosecution of any non-provisional patent application for, to pay a maintenance, annuity or renewal fee on, or to defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.

(e) Minimum Rights to *Contractor* and Protection of the *Contractor* Right to File

(1) The *contractor* will retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the *contractor* fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in (c), above. The *contractor's* license extends to its domestic subsidiary and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the *contractor* is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the *contractor* was legally obligated to do so at the time the *contract* was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of the *Federal agency* except when transferred to the sucessor of that party of the *contractor's* business to which the invention pertains.

(2) The *contractor's* domestic license may be revoked or modified by the *funding Federal agency* to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of the subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR part 404 and *agency* licensing regulations (if any). This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the *contractor* has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of the *funding Federal agency* to the extent the *contractor,* its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.

(3) Before revocation or modification of the license, the *funding Federal agency* will furnish the *contractor* a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the *contractor* will be allowed thirty days (or such other time as may be authorized by the *funding Federal agency* for good cause shown by the *contractor*) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The *contractor* has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR part 404 and *agency* regulations (if any) concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.

(f) *Contractor* Action to Protect the Government's Interest

(1) The *contractor* agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to the *Federal agency* all instruments necessary to (i) establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which the *contractor* elects to retain title, and (ii) convey title to the *Federal agency* when requested under paragraph (d) above and to enable the government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.

(2) The *contractor* agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the *contractor* each subject invention made under contract in order that the *contractor* can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this clause, to assign to the *contractor* the entire right, title and interest in and to each subject invention made under contract, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this clause. The *contractor* shall instruct such employees through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.

(3) For each subject invention, the *contractor* will, no less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the statutory deadline, notify the *Federal agency* of any decision: Not to continue the prosecution of a non-provisional patent application; not to pay a maintenance, annuity or renewal fee; not to defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country; to request, be a party to, or take action in a trial proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeals Board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including but not limited to post-grant review, review of a business method patent, *inter partes* review, and derivation proceeding; or to request, be a party to, or take action in a non-trial submission of art or information at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including but not limited to a pre-issuance submission, a post-issuance submission, and supplemental examination.

(4) The *contractor* agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent applications and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement, โThis invention was made with government support under (identify the *contract*) awarded by (identify the Federal agency). The government has certain rights in the invention.โ

(g) Subcontracts

(1) The *contractor* will include this clause, suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental or research work to be performed by a subcontractor.. The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the *contractor* in this clause, and the *contractor* will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.

(2) The *contractor* will include in all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental developmental or research work the patent rights clause required by (*cite section of agency implementing regulations or FAR*).

(3) In the case of subcontracts, at any tier, when the prime award with the Federal agency was a contract (but not a grant or cooperative agreement), the *agency,* subcontractor, and the contractor agree that the mutual obligations of the parties created by this clause constitute a contract between the subcontractor and the Federal agency with respect to the matters covered by the clause; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph is intended to confer any jurisdiction under the Contract Disputes Act in connection with proceedings under paragraph (j) of this clause.

(h) Reporting on Utilization of Subject Inventions

The *Contractor* agrees to submit on request periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the *contractor* or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the contractor, and such other data and information as the *agency* may reasonably specify. The *contractor* also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the *agency* in connection with any march-in proceeding undertaken by the *agency* in accordance with paragraph (j) of this clause. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the *agency* agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the government without permission of the *contractor.*

(i) Preference for United States Industry

Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the *contractor* agrees that neither it nor any assignee will grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject inventions in the United States unless such person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement for such an agreement may be waived by the *Federal agency* upon a showing by the *contractor* or its assignee that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the United States or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.

(j) March-in Rights

The *contractor* agrees that with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, the *Federal agency* has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the *agency* to require the *contractor,* an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the *contractor,* assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request the *Federal agency* has the right to grant such a license itself if the *Federal agency* determines that:

(1) Such action is necessary because the *contractor* or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use.

(2) Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the *contractor,* assignee or their licensees;

(3) Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the *contractor,* assignee or licensees; or

(4) Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this clause has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.

(k) Special Provisions for *Contracts* with Nonprofit Organizations

If the *contractor* is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that:

(1) Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of the *Federal agency,* except where such assignment is made to an organization which has as one of its primary functions the management of inventions, provided that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the *contractor;*

(2) The *contractor* will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when the agency deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;

(3) The balance of any royalties or income earned by the *contractor* with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidential to the administration of subject inventions, will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and

(4) It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the *contractor* determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided, that the *contractor* is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the contractor. However, the *contractor* agrees that the *Federal agency* may review the *contractor's* licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the *contractor* will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the *Federal agency* when the *Federal agency's* review discloses that the *contractor* could take reasonable steps to implement more effectively the requirements of this paragraph (k)(4). In accordance with 37 CFR 401.7, the *Federal agency* or the *contractor* may request that the Secretary review the *contractor's* licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants.
