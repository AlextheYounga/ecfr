##### § 1.823 Requirements for nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as part of the application. #####

(a)(1) If the “Sequence Listing” required by § 1.821(c) is submitted on paper: The “Sequence Listing,” setting forth the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence and associated information in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must begin on a new page and must be titled “Sequence Listing.” The pages of the “Sequence Listing” preferably should be numbered independently of the numbering of the remainder of the application. Each page of the “Sequence Listing” shall contain no more than 66 lines and each line shall contain no more than 72 characters. The sheet or sheets presenting a sequence listing may not include material other than part of the sequence listing. A fixed-width font should be used exclusively throughout the “Sequence Listing.”

(2) If the “Sequence Listing” required by § 1.821(c) is submitted on compact disc: The “Sequence Listing” must be submitted on a compact disc in compliance with § 1.52(e). The compact disc may also contain table information if the application contains table information that may be submitted on a compact disc (§ 1.52(e)(1)(iii)). The specification must contain an incorporation-by-reference of the Sequence Listing as required by § 1.52(e)(5). The presentation of the “Sequence Listing” and other materials on compact disc under § 1.821(c) does not substitute for the Computer Readable Form that must be submitted on disk, compact disc, or tape in accordance with § 1.824.

(b) The “Sequence Listing” shall, except as otherwise indicated, include the actual nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, the numeric identifiers and their accompanying information as shown in the following table. The numeric identifier shall be used only in the “Sequence Listing.” The order and presentation of the items of information in the “Sequence Listing” shall conform to the arrangement given below. Each item of information shall begin on a new line and shall begin with the numeric identifier enclosed in angle brackets as shown. The submission of those items of information designated with an “M” is mandatory. The submission of those items of information designated with an “O” is optional. Numeric identifiers \<110\>through \<170\>shall only be set forth at the beginning of the “Sequence Listing.” The following table illustrates the numeric identifiers.
