A Licensee's Unique Sound Recordings Count for an Annual Calculation Period will be calculated by adding together the counts of unique and royalty-bearing sound recordings reported by such Licensee to the MLC during each month of that twelve-month period, and dividing that sum by twelve. Within each month's usage reports from a particular Licensee, a sound recording reported multiple times with the same metadata would be counted as a single sound recording, and a sound recording reported multiple times each with different metadata would be counted multiple times, once for each reporting with new or different metadata.
