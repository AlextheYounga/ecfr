##### § 381.6 Performance of musical compositions by other public broadcasting entities. #####

(a) *Scope.* This section applies to the performance of copyrighted published nondramatic musical compositions by radio stations not licensed to colleges, universities, or other nonprofit educational institutions and not affiliated with NPR. In the event that a station owned by a public broadcasting entity broadcasts programming by means of an in-band, on-channel (“IBOC”) digital radio signal and such programming is different than the station's analog broadcast programming, then any such programming shall be deemed to be provided by a separate station requiring a separate royalty payment.

(b) *Definitions.* As used in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the following terms and their variant forms mean the following:

(1) *Feature Music* shall mean any performance of a musical work, whether live or recorded, that is the principal focus of audience attention. Feature Music does not include bridge, background, or underscore music, themes or signatures, interstitial music between programs such as in public service announcements or program sponsorship identifications, brief musical transitions in and out of program segments (not to exceed 60 seconds in duration), incidental performances of music during broadcasts of public, religious, or sports events, or brief performances during news, talk, religious, and sports programming of no more than 30 seconds in duration.

(2) *Population Count.* The combination of:

(i) The number of persons estimated to reside within a station's Predicted 60 dBu Contour, based on the most recent available census data; and

(ii) The nonduplicative number of persons estimated to reside in the Predicted 60 dBu Contour of any Translator or Booster Station that extends a public broadcasting entity's signal beyond the contours of a station's Predicted 60 dBu Contour.

(iii) In determining Population Count, a station or a Translator or Booster Station may use and report the total population data, from a research company generally recognized in the broadcasting industry, for the radio market within which the station's community license is located.

(3) *Predicted 60 dBu Contour* shall be calculated as set forth in 47 CFR 73.313.

(4) *Talk Format Station* shall mean a noncommercial radio station:

(i) Whose program content primarily consists of talk shows, news programs, sports, community affairs or religious sermons (or other non-music-oriented programming);

(ii) That performs Feature Music in less than 20% of its programming annually; and

(iii) That performs music-oriented programming for no more than four (4) programming hours during the hours from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. each weekday, with no two (2) hours of such programming occurring consecutively, with the exception of up to five (5) weekdays during the year.

(5) *Weekday* shall mean the 24-hour period starting at 12 a.m. through 11:59 p.m. on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays occurring between January 1 of a given year up to and including Thanksgiving day of that year.

(6) *Translator Station* and *Booster Station* shall have the same meanings as set forth in 47 CFR 74.1201.

(c) *Voluntary license agreements.* Notwithstanding the schedule of rates and terms established in this section, the rates and terms of any license agreements entered into by copyright owners and noncommercial radio stations within the scope of this section concerning the performance of copyrighted musical compositions, including performances by noncommercial radio stations, shall apply in lieu of the rates and terms of this section.
