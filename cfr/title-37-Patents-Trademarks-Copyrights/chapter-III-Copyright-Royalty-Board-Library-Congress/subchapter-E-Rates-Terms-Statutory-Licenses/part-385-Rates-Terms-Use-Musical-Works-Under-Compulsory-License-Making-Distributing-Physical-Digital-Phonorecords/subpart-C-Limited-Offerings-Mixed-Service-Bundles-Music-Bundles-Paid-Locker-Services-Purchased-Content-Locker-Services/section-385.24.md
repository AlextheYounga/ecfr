##### § 385.24 Free trial periods. #####

(a) *General provisions.* This section establishes a royalty rate of zero in the case of certain free trial periods for mixed service bundles, paid locker services and limited offerings under a license pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115. Subject to the requirements of 17 U.S.C. 115 and the additional provisions of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section, the free trial royalty rate shall apply to a musical work when a record company transmits or authorizes the transmission, as part of a mixed service bundle, paid locker service or limited offering, of a sound recording that embodies such musical work, only if -

(1) The primary purpose of the record company in providing or authorizing the free trial period is to promote the applicable subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21;

(2) No applicable consideration for making or authorizing the transmissions is received by the record company, or any other person or entity acting on behalf of or in lieu of the record company, except for in-kind promotional consideration used to promote the sale or paid use of sound recordings or audiovisual works embodying musical works or the paid use of music services through which sound recordings or audiovisual works embodying musical works are available;

(3) The free trial period does not exceed 30 consecutive days per subscriber per two-year period;

(4) In connection with authorizing the transmissions, the record company has obtained from the service provider it authorizes a written representation that -

(i) The service provider agrees to maintain for a period of no less than 5 years from the end of each relevant accounting period complete and accurate records of the relevant authorization, and identifying each sound recording of a musical work made available through the free trial period, the licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, involved, and the number of plays or downloads, as applicable, of such recording;

(ii) The service is in all material respects operating with appropriate license authority with respect to the musical works it is using; and

(iii) The representation is signed by a person authorized to make the representation on behalf of the service provider;

(5) Upon receipt by the record company of written notice from the copyright owner of a musical work or agent of the copyright owner stating in good faith that a particular service is in a material manner operating without appropriate license authority from such copyright owner, the record company shall within 5 business days withdraw by written notice its authorization of such uses of such copyright owner's musical works under the free trial royalty rate by that service;

(6) The free trial period is offered free of any charge to the end user; and

(7) End users are periodically offered an opportunity to subscribe to the service during such free trial period.

(b) *Recordkeeping by record companies.* To rely upon the free trial royalty rate for a free trial period, a record company making or authorizing the free trial period shall keep complete and accurate contemporaneous written records of the contractual terms that bear upon the free trial period; and further provided that, if the record company itself is conducting the free trial period, it shall also maintain any additional records described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section. The records required by this paragraph (b) shall be maintained for no less time than the record company maintains records of usage of royalty-bearing uses involving the same type of licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, in the ordinary course of business, but in no event for less than 5 years from the conclusion of the licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, to which they pertain. If the copyright owner of a musical work or its agent requests a copy of the information to be maintained under this paragraph (b) with respect to a specific free trial period, the record company shall provide complete and accurate documentation within 10 business days, except for any information required under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, which shall be provided within 20 business days, and provided that if the copyright owner or agent requests information concerning a large volume of free trial periods or sound recordings, the record company shall have a reasonable time, in view of the amount of information requested, to respond to any request of such copyright owner or agent. If the record company does not provide required information within the required time, and upon receipt of written notice citing such failure does not provide such information within a further 10 business days, the uses will be considered not to be subject to the free trial royalty rate and the record company (but not any third-party service it has authorized) shall be liable for any payment due for such uses; provided, however, that all rights and remedies of the copyright owner with respect to unauthorized uses shall be preserved.

(c) *Recordkeeping by services.* If the copyright owner of a musical work or its agent requests a copy of the information to be maintained under paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section by a service authorized by a record company with respect to a specific promotion, the service provider shall provide complete and accurate documentation within 20 business days, provided that if the copyright owner or agent requests information concerning a large volume of free trial periods or sound recordings, the service provider shall have a reasonable time, in view of the amount of information requested, to respond to any request of such copyright owner or agent. If the service provider does not provide required information within the required time, and upon receipt of written notice citing such failure does not provide such information within a further 10 business days, the uses will be considered not to be subject to the free trial royalty rate and the service provider (but not the record company) will be liable for any payment due for such uses; provided, however, that all rights and remedies of the copyright owner with respect to unauthorized uses shall be preserved.

(d) *Interpretation.* The free trial royalty rate is exclusively for audio-only licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, involving musical works subject to licensing under 17 U.S.C. 115. The free trial royalty rate does not apply to any other use under 17 U.S.C. 115; nor does it apply to public performances, audiovisual works, lyrics or other uses outside the scope of 17 U.S.C. 115. Without limitation, uses subject to licensing under 17 U.S.C. 115 that do not qualify for the free trial royalty rate (including without limitation licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, beyond the time limitations applicable to the free trial royalty rate) require payment of applicable royalties. This section is based on an understanding of industry practices and market conditions at the time of its development, among other things. The terms of this section shall be subject to de novo review and consideration (or elimination altogether) in future proceedings before the Copyright Royalty Judges. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted or construed in such a manner as to nullify or diminish any limitation, requirement or obligation of 17 U.S.C. 115 or other protection for musical works afforded by the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. 101, *et seq.*
