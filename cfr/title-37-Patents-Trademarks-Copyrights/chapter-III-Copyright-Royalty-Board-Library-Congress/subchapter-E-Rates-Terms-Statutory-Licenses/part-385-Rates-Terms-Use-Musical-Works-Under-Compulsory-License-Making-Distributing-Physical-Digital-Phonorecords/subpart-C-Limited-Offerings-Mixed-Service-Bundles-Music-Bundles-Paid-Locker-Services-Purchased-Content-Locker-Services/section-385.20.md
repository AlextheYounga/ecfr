(a) *Scope.* This subpart establishes rates and terms of royalty payments for certain reproductions or distributions of musical works through limited offerings, mixed service bundles, music bundles, paid locker services and purchased content locker services provided in accordance with the provisions of 17 U.S.C. 115. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that product configurations for which rates are specified in subpart A of this part are included within licensed subpart C activity, as defined in ยง 385.21, the rates specified in subpart A of this part shall not apply, except that in the case of a music bundle the compulsory licensee may elect to pay royalties for the music bundle pursuant to subpart C of this part or for the components of the bundle pursuant to subpart A of this part.

(b) *Legal compliance.* A licensee that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115, makes or authorizes reproduction or distribution of musical works in limited offerings, mixed service bundles, music bundles, paid locker services or purchased content locker services shall comply with the requirements of that section, the rates and terms of this subpart, and any other applicable regulations, with respect to such musical works and uses licensed pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115.

(c) *Interpretation.* This subpart is intended only to set rates and terms for situations in which the exclusive rights of a copyright owner are implicated and a compulsory license pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115 is obtained. Neither this subpart nor the act of obtaining a license under 17 U.S.C. 115 is intended to express or imply any conclusion as to the circumstances in which any of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner are implicated or a license, including a compulsory license pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115, must be obtained.
