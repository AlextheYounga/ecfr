##### § 385.22 Calculation of royalty payments in general. #####

(a) *Applicable royalty.* Licensees that make or authorize licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115 shall pay royalties therefor that are calculated as provided in this section, subject to the royalty rates and subscriber-based royalty floors for specific types of services provided in § 385.23, except as provided for certain free trial periods in § 385.24.

(b) *Rate calculation methodology.* Royalty payments for licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, shall be calculated as provided in this paragraph (b). If a service provides different subpart C offerings, as defined in § 385.21, royalties must be separately calculated with respect to each such subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, taking into consideration service revenue and expenses associated with such offering. Uses subject to the free trial royalty rate shall be excluded from the calculation of royalties due, as further described in this section and § 385.23.

(1) *Step 1:* Calculate the All-In Royalty for the Subpart C Offering, as Defined in § 385.21. For each accounting period, the all-in royalty for each subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, of the service provider is the greater of:

(i) The applicable percentage of subpart C service revenue, as defined in § 385.21, associated with the relevant offering as set forth in § 385.23(a) (excluding any subpart C service revenue, as defined in § 385.21, derived solely from licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, uses subject to the free trial royalty rate); and

(ii) The minimum specified in § 385.23(a) for the subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, involved.

(2) *Step 2:* Subtract applicable performance royalties to determine the payable royalty pool, which is the amount payable for the reproduction and distribution of all musical works used by the service provider by virtue of its licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, for a particular subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, during the accounting period. From the amount determined in step 1 in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for each subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, of the service provider, subtract the total amount of royalties for public performance of musical works that has been or will be expensed pursuant to public performance licenses in connection with uses of musical works through such subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, during the accounting period that constitute licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, (other than licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, subject to the free trial royalty rate), or in connection with previewing of such subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, during the accounting period. Although this amount may be the total of the payments with respect to the service for that subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, for the accounting period, it will be less than the total of such public performance payments if the service is also engaging in public performance of musical works that does not constitute licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, or previewing of such licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21. In the case where the service is also engaging in the public performance of musical works that does not constitute licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, the amount to be subtracted for public performance payments shall be the amount of such payments allocable to licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, uses (other than free trial royalty rate uses), and previewing of such uses, in connection with the relevant subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, as determined in relation to all uses of musical works for which the public performance payments are made for the accounting period. Such allocation shall be made on the basis of plays of musical works or, where per-play information is unavailable due to bona fide technical limitations as described in step 3 in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, using the same alternative methodology as provided in step 3 in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

(3) *Step 3:* Calculate the Per-Work Royalty Allocation for Each Relevant Work. This is the amount payable for the reproduction and distribution of each musical work used by the service provider by virtue of its licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, through a particular subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21, during the accounting period. To determine this amount, the result determined in step 2 in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be allocated to each musical work used through the subpart C offering, as defined in § 385.21. The allocation shall be accomplished as follows:

(i) In the case of limited offerings (but not limited offerings that are part of mixed service bundles), by dividing the payable royalty pool determined in step 2 in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for such offering by the total number of plays of all musical works through such offering during the accounting period (other than free trial royalty rate plays) to yield a per-play allocation, and multiplying that result by the number of plays of each musical work (other than free trial royalty rate plays) through the offering during the accounting period. For purposes of determining the per-work royalty allocation in all calculations under this step 3 only (i.e., after the payable royalty pool has been determined), for sound recordings of musical works with a playing time of over 5 minutes, each play shall be counted as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the service provider is not capable of tracking play information due to bona fide limitations of the available technology for services of that nature or of devices usable with the service, the per-work royalty allocation may instead be accomplished in a manner consistent with the methodology used by the service provider for making royalty payment allocations for the use of individual sound recordings.

(ii) In the case of mixed service bundles and locker services, by -

(A) Determining a constructive number of plays of all licensed musical works that is the sum of the total number of interactive streams of all licensed musical works made through such offering during the accounting period (other than free trial royalty rate interactive streams), plus the total number of plays of restricted downloads of all licensed musical works made through such offering during the accounting period as to which the service provider tracks plays (other than free trial royalty rate restricted downloads), plus 5 times the total number of downloads of all licensed musical works made through such offering during the accounting period as to which the service provider does not track plays (other than free trial royalty rate downloads);

(B) Determining a constructive per-play allocation that is the payable royalty pool determined in step 2 of paragraph (b)(2) of this section for such offering divided by the constructive number of plays of all licensed musical works determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section;

(C) For each licensed musical work, determining a constructive number of plays of that musical work that is the sum of the total number of interactive streams of such licensed musical work made through such offering during the accounting period (other than free trial royalty rate interactive streams), plus the total number of plays of restricted downloads of such licensed musical work made through such offering during the accounting period as to which the service provider tracks plays (other than free trial royalty rate restricted downloads), plus 5 times the total number of downloads of such licensed musical work made through such offering during the accounting period as to which the service provider does not track plays (other than free trial royalty rate downloads); and

(D) For each licensed musical work, determining the per-work royalty allocation by multiplying the constructive per-play allocation determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section by the constructive number of plays of that musical work determined in paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section.

(E) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a service provider offers both a paid locker service and a purchased content locker service, and with respect to the purchased content locker service there is no subpart C service revenue, as defined in § 385.21, and the applicable subminimum is zero dollars, then the service provider shall be permitted to include within the calculation of constructive plays under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A) and (C) of this section for the paid locker service, the licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, made through the purchased content locker service (i.e., the total number of interactive streams of all licensed musical works made through the purchased content locker service during the accounting period (other than free trial royalty rate interactive streams), plus the total number of plays of restricted downloads of all licensed musical works made through the purchased content locker service during the accounting period as to which the service provider tracks plays (other than free trial royalty rate restricted downloads), plus 5 times the total number of downloads of all licensed musical works made through the purchased content locker service during the accounting period as to which the service provider does not track plays (other than free trial royalty rate downloads)); provided that the relevant licensed subpart C activity, as defined in § 385.21, made through the purchased content locker service is similarly included within the play calculation for the paid locker service for the corresponding sound recording rights.

(iii) In the case of music bundles, by -

(A) Allocating the payable royalty pool determined in step 2 of paragraph (b)(2) of this section to separate pools for each type of product configuration included in the music bundle (e.g., CD, permanent digital download, ringtone) in accordance with the ratios that the standalone published prices of the products that are included in the music bundle bear to each other; provided that, if there is no such standalone published price for such a product, then the average standalone published price for end users for the most closely comparable product in the U.S. shall be used or, if more than one such comparable exists, the average of such standalone prices for such comparables shall be used; and

(B) Allocating the product configuration pools determined in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(A) of this section to individual musical works by dividing each such pool by the total number of sound recordings of musical works included in products of that configuration in the music bundle.

(c) *Overtime adjustment.* For purposes of the calculations in step 3 of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section only, for sound recordings of musical works with a playing time of over 5 minutes, adjust the number of plays as follows:

(1) 5:01 to 6:00 minutes - Each play = 1.2 plays

(2) 6:01 to 7:00 minutes - Each play = 1.4 plays

(3) 7:01 to 8:00 minutes - Each play = 1.6 plays

(4) 8:01 to 9:00 minutes - Each play = 1.8 plays

(5) 9:01 to 10:00 minutes - Each play = 2.0 plays

(6) For playing times of greater than 10 minutes, continue to add .2 plays for each additional minute or fraction thereof.
