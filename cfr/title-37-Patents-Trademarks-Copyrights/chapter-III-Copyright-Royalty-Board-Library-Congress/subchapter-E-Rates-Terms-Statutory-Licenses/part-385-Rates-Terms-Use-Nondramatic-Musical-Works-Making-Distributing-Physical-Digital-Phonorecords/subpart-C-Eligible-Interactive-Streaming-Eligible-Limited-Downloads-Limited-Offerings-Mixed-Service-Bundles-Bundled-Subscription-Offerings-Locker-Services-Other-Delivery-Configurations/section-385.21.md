##### ยง 385.21 Royalty rates and calculations. #####

(a) *Applicable royalty.* Licensees that engage in Licensed Activity covered by this subpart pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 115 shall pay royalties therefor that are calculated as provided in this section, subject to the royalty floors for specific types of services described in ยง 385.22.

(b) *Rate calculation.* Royalty payments for Licensed Activity in this subpart shall be calculated as provided in paragraph (b) of this section. If a Service Provider includes different Offerings, royalties must be calculated separately with respect to each Offering taking into consideration Service Provider Revenue and expenses associated with each Offering.

(1) *Step 1: Calculate the all-In royalty for the Offering.* For each Accounting Period, the all-in royalty shall be the greater of the applicable percent of Service Provider Revenue and the applicable percent of TCC set forth in the following table.

Table 1 to Paragraph (b)(1) - 2018-2022 All-In Royalty Rates

|   Royalty year   |2018  <br/>(%)|2019  <br/>(%)|2020  <br/>(%)|2021  <br/>(%)|2022  <br/>(%)|
|------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|Percent of Revenue|     11.4     |     12.3     |     13.3     |     14.2     |     15.1     |
|  Percent of TCC  |     22.0     |     23.1     |     24.1     |     25.2     |     26.2     |

(2) *Step 2: Subtract applicable Performance Royalties.* From the amount determined in step 1 in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, for each Offering of the Service Provider, subtract the total amount of Performance Royalty that the Service Provider has expensed or will expense pursuant to public performance licenses in connection with uses of musical works through that Offering during the Accounting Period that constitute Licensed Activity. Although this amount may be the total of the Service Provider's payments for that Offering for the Accounting Period, it will be less than the total of the Performance Royalties if the Service Provider is also engaging in public performance of musical works that does not constitute Licensed Activity. In the case in which the Service Provider is also engaging in the public performance of musical works that does not constitute Licensed Activity, the amount to be subtracted for Performance Royalties shall be the amount allocable to Licensed Activity uses through the relevant Offering as determined in relation to all uses of musical works for which the Service Provider pays Performance Royalties for the Accounting Period. The Service Provider shall make this allocation on the basis of Plays of musical works or, where per-play information is unavailable because of *bona fide* technical limitations as described in step 3 in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, using the same alternative methodology as provided in step 4 in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.

(3) *Step 3: Determine the payable royalty pool.* The payable royalty pool is the amount payable for the reproduction and distribution of all musical works used by the Service Provider by virtue of its Licensed Activity for a particular Offering during the Accounting Period. This amount is the greater of:

(i) The result determined in step 2 in paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and

(ii) The royalty floor (if any) resulting from the calculations described in ยง 385.22.

(4) *Step 4: Calculate the per-work royalty allocation.* This is the amount payable for the reproduction and distribution of each musical work used by the Service Provider by virtue of its Licensed Activity through a particular Offering during the Accounting Period. To determine this amount, the result determined in step 3 in paragraph (b)(3) of this section must be allocated to each musical work used through the Offering. The allocation shall be accomplished by dividing the payable royalty pool determined in step 3 for the Offering by the total number of Plays of all musical works through the Offering during the Accounting Period (other than Plays subject to subpart D of this part) to yield a per-Play allocation, and multiplying that result by the number of Plays of each musical work (other than Plays subject to subpart D of this part)) through the Offering during the Accounting Period. For purposes of determining the per-work royalty allocation in all calculations under step 4 in this paragraph (b)(4) only (*i.e.,* after the payable royalty pool has been determined), for sound recordings of musical works with a playing time of over 5 minutes, each Play shall be counted as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Service Provider is not capable of tracking Play information because of *bona fide* limitations of the available technology for Offerings of that nature or of devices useable with the Offering, the per-work royalty allocation may instead be accomplished in a manner consistent with the methodology used for making royalty payment allocations for the use of individual sound recordings.

(c) *Overtime adjustment.* For purposes of the calculations in step 4 in paragraph (b)(4) of this section only, for sound recordings of musical works with a playing time of over 5 minutes, adjust the number of Plays as follows.

(1) 5:01 to 6:00 minutes - Each play = 1.2 plays.

(2) 6:01 to 7:00 minutes - Each play = 1.4 plays.

(3) 7:01 to 8:00 minutes - Each play = 1.6 plays.

(4) 8:01 to 9:00 minutes - Each play = 1.8 plays.

(5) 9:01 to 10:00 minutes - Each play = 2.0 plays.

(6) For playing times of greater than 10 minutes, continue to add 0.2 plays for each additional minute or fraction thereof.

(d) *Accounting.* The calculations required by paragraph (b) of this section shall be made in good faith and on the basis of the best knowledge, information, and belief at the time payment is due, and subject to the additional accounting and certification requirements of 17 U.S.C. 115(c)(2)(I), 17 U.S.C. 115(d)(4)(A)(i), and part 210 of this title. Without limitation, statements of account shall set forth each step of the calculations with sufficient information to allow the assessment of the accuracy and manner in which the payable royalty pool and per-play allocations (including information sufficient to demonstrate whether and how a royalty floor pursuant to ยง 385.22 does or does not apply) were determined and, for each Offering reported, also indicate the type of Licensed Activity involved and the number of Plays of each musical work (including an indication of any overtime adjustment applied) that is the basis of the per-work royalty allocation being paid.
