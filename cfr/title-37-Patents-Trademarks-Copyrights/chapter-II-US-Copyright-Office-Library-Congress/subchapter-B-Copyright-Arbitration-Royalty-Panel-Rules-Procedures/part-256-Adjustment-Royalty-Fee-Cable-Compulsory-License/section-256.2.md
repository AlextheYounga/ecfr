##### § 256.2 Royalty fee for compulsory license for secondary transmission by cable systems. #####

(a) Commencing with the second semiannual accounting period of 2005 and for each semiannual accounting period thereafter, the royalty rates established by 17 U.S.C. 111(d)(1)(B) shall be as follows:

(1) 1.013 of 1 per centum of such gross receipts for the privilege of further transmitting any nonnetwork programming of a primary transmitter in whole or in part beyond the local service area of such primary transmitter, such amount to be applied against the fees, if any, payable pursuant to paragraphs (a) (2) through (4) and (c);

(2) 1.013 of 1 per centum of such gross receipts for the first distant signal equivalent;

(3) .668 of 1 per centum of such gross receipts for each of the second, third and fourth distant signal equivalents; and

(4) .314 of 1 per centum of such gross receipts for the fifth distant signal equivalent and each additional distant signal equivalent thereafter.

(b) Commencing with the second semiannual accounting period of 2005 and for each semiannual accounting period thereafter, the gross receipts limitations established by 17 U.S.C. 111(d)(1) (C) and (D) shall be adjusted as follows:

(1) If the actual gross receipts paid by subscribers to a cable system for the period covered by the statement for the basic service of providing secondary transmission of primary broadcast transmitters total $263,800 or less, gross receipts of the cable system for the purpose of this paragraph shall be computed by subtracting from such actual gross receipts the amount by which $263,800 exceeds such actual gross receipts, except that in no case shall a cable system's gross receipts be reduced to less than $10,400. The royalty fee payable under this paragraph shall be 0.5 of 1 per centum regardless of the number of distant signal equivalents, if any; and

(2) If the actual gross receipts paid by the subscribers to a cable system for the period covered by the statement, for the basic service of providing secondary transmissions of primary broadcast transmitters, are more than $263,800 but less than $527,600, the royalty fee payable under this paragraph shall be:

(i) 0.5 of 1 per centum of any gross receipts up to $263,800 and

(ii) 1 per centum of any gross receipts in excess of $263,800 but less than $527,600, regardless of the number of distant signal equivalents, if any.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, commencing with the first accounting period of 1983 and for each semiannual accounting period thereafter, for each distant signal equivalent or fraction thereof not represented by the carriage of:

(1) Any signal which was permitted (or, in the case of cable systems commencing operations after June 24, 1981, which would have been permitted) under the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on June 24, 1981, or

(2) A signal of the same type (that is, independent, network, or non-commercial educational) substituted for such permitted signal, or

(3) A signal which was carried pursuant to an individual waiver of the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission, as such rules were in effect on June 24, 1981;

the royalty rate shall be, in lieu of the royalty rates specified in paragraphs (a) (2) through (4) and (d) of this section, 3.75 per centum of the gross receipts of the cable systems for each distant signal equivalent; any fraction of a distant signal equivalent shall be computed at its fractional value.

(d) Commencing with the first semiannual accounting period of 1990 and for each semiannual accounting period thereafter, in the case of a cable system located outside the 35-mile specified zone of a commercial VHF station that places a predicted Grade B contour, in whole or in part, over the cable system, and that is not significantly viewed or otherwise exempt from the FCC's syndicated exclusivity rules in effect on June 24, 1981, for each distant signal equivalent or fraction thereof represented by the carriage of such commercial VHF station, the royalty rate shall be, in addition to the amount specified in paragraph (a) of this section,

(1) For cable systems located wholly or in part within a top 50 television market,

(i) .599 per centum of such gross receipts for the first distant signal equivalent;

(ii) .377 per centum of such gross receipts for each of the second, third, and fourth distant signal equivalents; and

(iii) .089 per centum of such gross receipts for the fifth distant signal equivalent and each additional distant signal equivalent thereafter;

(3) For purposes of this section *top 50 television markets* and “second 50 television markets” shall be defined as the comparable terms are defined or interpreted in accordance with 47 CFR 76.51, as effective June 24, 1981.
