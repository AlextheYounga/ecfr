##### § 202.4 Effective date of registration. #####

The effective date of registration for claims received in the Copyright Office on or after January 3, 1991, and through December 31, 1991, with a short fee of $10 is the date on which the application, deposit, and $10 fee have all been received in the Copyright Office, provided, the claim is later determined to be acceptable for registration by the Register of Copyrights and a supplementary fee of $10 is received in the Copyright Office. If the supplementary fee is not received promptly after notification of the short fee, the Copyright Office will initiate a proceeding to cancel the copyright registration. If the supplementary fee of $10 is not received in the Copyright Office before the cancellation proceeding is completed, the cancellation will become final and will result in the loss of the effective date of registration. After cancellation, registration could be obtained only by submitting a new application, deposit, and filing fee.
