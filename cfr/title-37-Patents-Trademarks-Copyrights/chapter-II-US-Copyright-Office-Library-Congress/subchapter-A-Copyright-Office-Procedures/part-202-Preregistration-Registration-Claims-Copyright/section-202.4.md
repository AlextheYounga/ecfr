(c) [Reserved]

(d) *Group registration of serials.* Pursuant to the authority granted by 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(1), the Register of Copyrights has determined that a group of serial issues may be registered with one application, the required deposit, and the filing fee required by § 201.3(c) of this chapter, if the following conditions are met:

(1) *Eligible works.* (i) All the issues in the group must be serials.

(ii) The group must include at least two issues.

(iii) Each issue in the group must be an all-new collective work that has not been previously published, each issue must be fixed and distributed as a discrete, self-contained collective work, and the claim in each issue must be limited to the collective work.

(iv) Each issue in the group must be a work made for hire, and the author and claimant for each issue must be the same person or organization.

(v) The serial generally must be published at intervals of a week or longer. All of the issues must be published within three months, under the same continuing title, within the same calendar year, and the applicant must specify the date of publication for each issue in the group.

(2) *Application.* The applicant may complete and submit the online application designated for a group of serial issues. Alternatively, the applicant may complete and submit a paper application using Form SE/Group, provided that the application is received on or before December 30, 2019. The application may be submitted by any of the parties listed in § 202.3(c)(1).

(3) *Deposit.* The applicant must submit one complete copy of each issue that is included in the group. Copies submitted under this paragraph will be considered solely for the purpose of registration under 17 U.S.C. 408, and will not satisfy the mandatory deposit requirement under 17 U.S.C. 407.

(i) The issues may be submitted in digital form if the following requirements have been met. Each issue must be contained in a separate electronic file. The applicant must use the file-naming convention and submit digital files in accordance with instructions specified on the Copyright Office's website. The files must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF), they must be assembled in an orderly form, and they must be uploaded to the electronic registration system as individual electronic files (*i.e.,* not .zip files). The files must be viewable and searchable, contain embedded fonts, and be free from any access restrictions (such as those implemented through digital rights management) that prevent the viewing and examination of the work. The file size for each uploaded file must not exceed 500 megabytes, but files may be compressed to comply with this requirement.

(ii) Alternatively, the applicant may submit a physical copy of each issue, provided that the deposit is received on or before December 30, 2019. If the claim is submitted with an online application, the copies must be accompanied by the required shipping slip generated by the electronic registration system, the shipping slip must be attached to one of the copies, the copies and the shipping slip must be included in the same package, and the package must be sent to the address specified on the shipping slip.

(4) *Exceptional cases.* In an exceptional case, the Copyright Office may waive the online filing requirement set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section or may grant special relief from the deposit requirement under § 202.20(d), subject to such conditions as the Associate Register of Copyrights and Director of the Office of Registration Policy and Practice may impose on the applicant.

(e) *Group registration of newspapers.* Pursuant to the authority granted by 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(1), the Register of Copyrights has determined that a group of newspaper issues may be registered with one application, the required deposit, and the filing fee required by § 201.3(c) of this chapter, if the following conditions are met:

(1) *Issues must be newspapers.* All the issues in the group must be newspapers. For purposes of this section, a newspaper is a periodical (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that is mainly designed to be a primary source of written information on current events, either local, national, or international in scope. A newspaper contains a broad range of news on all subjects and activities and is not limited to any specific subject matter. Newspapers are intended either for the general public or for a particular ethnic, cultural, or national group.

(2) *Requirements for newspaper issues.* Each issue in the group must be an all-new collective work that has not been previously published (except where earlier editions of the same newspaper are included in the deposit together with the final edition), each issue must be fixed and distributed as a discrete, self-contained collective work, and the claim in each issue must be limited to the collective work.

(3) *Author and claimant.* Each issue in the group must be a work made for hire, and the author and claimant for each issue must be the same person or organization.

(4) *Time period covered.* All the issues in the group must be published under the same continuing title, and they must be published within the same calendar month and bear issue dates within that month. The applicant must identify the earliest and latest date that the issues were published.

(5) *Application.* The applicant must complete and submit the online application designated for a group of newspaper issues. The application may be submitted by any of the parties listed in § 202.3(c)(1).

(6) *Deposit.* (i) The applicant must submit one complete copy of the final edition of each issue published in the calendar month designated in the application. Each submission may also include earlier editions of the same newspaper issue, provided that they were published on the same date as the final edition. Each submission may also include local editions of the newspaper issue that were published within the same metropolitan area, but may not include national or regional editions that were distributed outside that metropolitan area.

(ii)(A) The issues must be submitted in a digital form, and each issue must be contained in a separate electronic file. The applicant must use the file-naming convention and submit digital files in accordance with instructions specified on the Copyright Office's website. The files must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF), they must be assembled in an orderly form, and they must be uploaded to the electronic registration system as individual electronic files (*i.e.,* not .zip files). The files must be viewable and searchable, contain embedded fonts, and be free from any access restrictions (such as those implemented through Digital Rights Management (DRM)). The file size for each uploaded file must not exceed 500 megabytes, but files may be compressed to comply with this requirement.

(B) Until December 31, 2019, the applicant may also submit the complete issues on positive 35mm silver halide microfilm at the same time as the application, in addition to providing electronic copies of the newspaper issues pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section. The issues should be arranged on the microfilm in chronological order, and should be sent to: Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office, Attn: 407 Deposits, 101 Independence Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20559. Should the applicant submit microfilm copies in addition to electronic files under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, the effective date of registration for a group registration under paragraph (e) of this section will be the date on which the Office received an acceptable application, the electronic files submitted under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A), and the proper filing fee. If the electronic files submitted under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) are deficient and the applicant also submits microfilm copies, the Register shall have discretion in determining whether the microfilm copies may be used to cure deficiencies in the electronic files (*e.g.,* an electronic file is missing some pages from one newspaper issue, but the microfilm contains a complete version of each issue in the group). In cases where the Register determines that microfilm copies can be used to cure deficiencies in the electronic files submitted under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A), the effective date of registration for a group registration under paragraph (e) of this section will be the date on which the Office received an acceptable application, the electronic files submitted under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A), and the proper filing fee.

(7) The application, the filing fee, and files specified in paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section must be received by the Copyright Office within three months after the date of publication for the earliest issue in the group.
