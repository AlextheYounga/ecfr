(2) For purposes of this section, the term *Library* means the Library of Congress.

(c)-(d) [Reserved]

(e) *Group registration of newspapers.* Pursuant to the authority granted by 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(1), the Register of Copyrights has determined that a group of newspaper issues may be registered with one application, the required deposit, and the filing fee required by § 201.3(c) of this chapter, if the following conditions are met:

(1) *Issues must be newspapers.* All the issues in the group must be newspapers. For purposes of this section, a newspaper is a periodical (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) that is mainly designed to be a primary source of written information on current events, either local, national, or international in scope. A newspaper contains a broad range of news on all subjects and activities and is not limited to any specific subject matter. Newspapers are intended either for the general public or for a particular ethnic, cultural, or national group.

(2) *Requirements for newspaper issues.* Each issue in the group must be an all-new collective work that has not been previously published (except where earlier editions of the same newspaper are included in the deposit together with the final edition), each issue must be fixed and distributed as a discrete, self-contained collective work, and the claim in each issue must be limited to the collective work.

(3) *Author and claimant.* Each issue in the group must be a work made for hire, and the author and claimant for each issue must be the same person or organization.

(4) *Time period covered.* All the issues in the group must be published under the same continuing title, and they must be published within the same calendar month and bear issue dates within that month. The applicant must identify the earliest and latest date that the issues were published.

(5) *Application.* The applicant must complete and submit the online application designated for a group of newspaper issues. The application may be submitted by any of the parties listed in § 202.3(c)(1).

(6) *Deposit.* (i) The applicant must submit one complete copy of the final edition of each issue published in the calendar month designated in the application. Each submission may also include earlier editions of the same newspaper issue, provided that they were published on the same date as the final edition. Each submission may also include local editions of the newspaper issue that were published within the same metropolitan area, but may not include national or regional editions that were distributed outside that metropolitan area.

(ii)(A) The issues must be submitted in a digital form, and each issue must be contained in a separate electronic file. The applicant must use the file-naming convention and submit digital files in accordance with instructions specified on the Copyright Office's website. The files must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF), they must be assembled in an orderly form, and they must be uploaded to the electronic registration system as individual electronic files (*i.e.,* not .zip files). The files must be viewable and searchable, contain embedded fonts, and be free from any access restrictions (such as those implemented through Digital Rights Management (DRM)). The file size for each uploaded file must not exceed 500 megabytes, but files may be compressed to comply with this requirement.

(B) Until December 31, 2019, the applicant may also submit the complete issues on positive 35mm silver halide microfilm at the same time as the application, in addition to providing electronic copies of the newspaper issues pursuant to paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section. The issues should be arranged on the microfilm in chronological order, and should be sent to: Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office, Attn: 407 Deposits, 101 Independence Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20559. Should the applicant submit microfilm copies in addition to electronic files under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, the effective date of registration for a group registration under paragraph (e) of this section will be the date on which the Office received an acceptable application, the electronic files submitted under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A), and the proper filing fee. If the electronic files submitted under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) are deficient and the applicant also submits microfilm copies, the Register shall have discretion in determining whether the microfilm copies may be used to cure deficiencies in the electronic files (*e.g.,* an electronic file is missing some pages from one newspaper issue, but the microfilm contains a complete version of each issue in the group). In cases where the Register determines that microfilm copies can be used to cure deficiencies in the electronic files submitted under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A), the effective date of registration for a group registration under paragraph (e) of this section will be the date on which the Office received an acceptable application, the electronic files submitted under paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A), and the proper filing fee.

(7) The application, the filing fee, and files specified in paragraph (e)(6)(ii)(A) of this section must be received by the Copyright Office within three months after the date of publication for the earliest issue in the group.

(f) [Reserved]

(g) *Group registration of contributions to periodicals.* Pursuant to the authority granted by 17 U.S.C. 408(c)(2), the Register of Copyrights has determined that a group of contributions to periodicals may be registered in Class TX or Class VA with one application, one filing fee, and the required deposit, if the following conditions are met:

(2) The copyright claimant must be the same person or organization for all the contributions.

(3) The contributions must not be works made for hire.

(4) Each work must be first published as a contribution to a periodical, and all the contributions must be first published within a twelve-month period (e.g., January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015; February 1, 2015 through January 31, 2016).

(5) If any of the contributions were first published before March 1, 1989, those works must bear a separate copyright notice, the notice must contain the copyright owner's name (or an abbreviation by which the name can be recognized, or a generally known alternative designation for the owner), and the name that appears in each notice must be the same.

(6) The applicant must complete and submit the online application designated for a group of contributions to periodicals. The application must identify each contribution that is included in the group, including the date of publication for each contribution and the periodical in which it was first published. The application may be submitted by any of the parties listed in § 202.3(c)(1). The application should be filed in Class TX if a majority of the contributions predominantly consist of text, and the application should be filed in Class VA if a majority of the contributions predominantly consist of photographs, illustrations, artwork, or other works of the visual arts.

(7) The appropriate filing fee, as required by § 201.3(c) of this chapter, must be included with the application or charged to an active deposit account.

(8) The applicant must submit one copy of each contribution that is included in the group, either by submitting the entire issue of the periodical where the contribution was first published, the entire section of the newspaper where it was first published, or the specific page(s) from the periodical where the contribution was first published. The contributions must be contained in separate electronic files that comply with § 202.20(b)(2)(iii). The files must be submitted in a PDF, JPG, or other electronic format approved by the Office, and they must be uploaded to the electronic registration system, preferably in a .zip file containing all the files. The file size for each uploaded file must not exceed 500 megabytes; the files may be compressed to comply with this requirement.

(9) In an exceptional case, the Copyright Office may waive the online filing requirement set forth in paragraph (g)(6) of this section or may grant special relief from the deposit requirement under § 202.20(d), subject to such conditions as the Associate Register of Copyrights and Director of the Office of Registration Policy and Practice may impose on the applicant.

The file size for each uploaded file must not exceed 500 megabytes; the photographs may be compressed to comply with this requirement. Alternatively, the photographs and the required numbered list may be saved on a physical storage device, such as a flash drive, CD-R, or DVD-R, and delivered to the Copyright Office together with the required shipping slip generated by the electronic registration system.

(10) The applicant must submit a sequentially numbered list containing a title and file name for each photograph in the group (matching the corresponding file names for each photograph specified in paragraph (h)(9) of this section).
