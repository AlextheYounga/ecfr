A group filing is permitted provided that:

The system allows an individual or firm to establish a Deposit Account in the Copyright Office and to make advance deposits into that account. Deposit Account holders can charge copyright fees against the balance in their accounts instead of sending separate remittances with each request for service. For information on Deposit Accounts, see Circular 5 on the Copyright Office's website, or request a copy at the address specified in § 201.1(b).
