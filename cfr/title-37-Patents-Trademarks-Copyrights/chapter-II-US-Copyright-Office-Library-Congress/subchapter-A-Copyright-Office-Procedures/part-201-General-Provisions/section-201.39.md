Each additional work in the group must be identified on a separate continuation sheet. The required format for the continuation sheet is set out in Appendix B to this section, and is available from the Copyright Office website (*http://lcweb.loc.gov/copyright*). A group filing is permitted provided that:

Postal money orders that are negotiable only at a post office and international money orders are not acceptable. CURRENCY IS NOT ACCEPTED.

(ii) *Copyright Office Deposit Account.* The Copyright Office maintains a system of Deposit Accounts for the convenience of those who frequently use its services. The system allows an individual or firm to establish a Deposit Account in the Copyright Office and to make advance deposits into that account. Deposit Account holders can charge copyright fees against the balance in their accounts instead of sending separate remittances with each request for service. For information on Deposit Accounts, see Circular 5 on the Copyright Office's website, or request a copy at the address specified in § 201.1(b).
