##### ยง 201.35 Schedules of pre-1972 sound recordings. #####

(a) *General.* This section prescribes the rules under which rights owners, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 1401(f)(5)(A), may file schedules listing their pre-1972 sound recordings with the Copyright Office to be eligible for statutory damages and/or attorneys' fees for violations of 17 U.S.C. 1401(a).

(b) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section:

(1) Unless otherwise specified, the terms used have the meanings set forth in 17 U.S.C. 1401.

(2) A *pre-1972 sound recording* is a sound recording fixed before February 15, 1972.

(c) *Form and submission.* A rights owner seeking to comply with 17 U.S.C. 1401(f)(5)(A) must submit a schedule listing the owner's pre-1972 sound recordings using an appropriate form provided by the Copyright Office on its website and following the instructions for completion and submission provided on the Office's website or the form itself. The Office may reject any submission that fails to comply with these requirements.

(d) *Content.* A schedule of pre-1972 sound recordings shall contain the following:

(1) For each sound recording listed, the right's owner name, sound recording title, and featured artist;

(2) A certification that the individual submitting the schedule of pre-1972 sound recordings has appropriate authority to submit the schedule and that all information submitted to the Office is true, accurate, and complete to the best of the individual's knowledge, information, and belief, and is made in good faith.

(3) For each sound recording listed, the rights owner may opt to include additional information as permitted and in the format specified by the Office's form or instructions, such as publication date, or alternate title information.

(e) *Transfer of rights ownership.* If ownership of a pre-1972 sound recording changes after its inclusion in a schedule filed with the Office under this section, the Office will consider the schedule to be effective as to any successor in interest. A successor in interest may, but is not required, to file a new schedule under this section.

(f) *Legal sufficiency of schedules.* The Copyright Office does not review schedules submitted under paragraph (c) of this section for legal sufficiency, interpret their content, or screen them for errors or discrepancies. The Office's review is limited to whether the procedural requirements established by the Office (including payment of the proper filing fee) have been met. Rights owners are therefore cautioned to review and scrutinize schedules to assure their legal sufficiency before submitting them to the Office.

(g) *Filing date.* The date of filing of a schedule of pre-1972 sound recordings is the date when a proper submission, including the prescribed fee, is received in the Copyright Office. The filing date may not necessarily be the same date that the schedule, for purposes of 17 U.S.C. 1401(f)(5)(A)(i)(II), is indexed into the Office's public records.

(h) *Fee.* The filing fee to submit a schedule of pre-1972 sound recordings pursuant to this section is prescribed in ยง 201.3(c).

(i) *Third-party notification.* A person may request timely notification of filings made under this section by following the instructions provided by the Copyright Office on its website.
