##### § 418.36 Incentives for additional long term conservation. #####

(a) As an incentive for the District to increase the efficiency of the delivery system beyond the expected efficiency of 65.7 percent (66.9 percent with full delivery) as shown in the Newlands Project Water Budget table, 1995 Example, the District will be allowed to store and use the Carson River portion of the saved water at its discretion, in accordance with Nevada State Law and this part.

(1) If the District is able to exceed its expected efficiency, the District may store in Lahontan Reservoir two-thirds (2/3) of the additional water saved. (The remaining one-third (1/3) of the water saved will remain in the Truckee River through reduced diversions to Lahontan Reservoir). This water will be considered incentive water saved from the Carson River and will not be counted as storage in determining diversions from the Truckee River or computing the target storage levels for Lahontan Reservoir under this part.

(2) For purposes of this part, incentive water is no longer considered Project water. The District may use the water for any purpose (e.g., wetlands, storage for recreation, power generation, shortage reduction) that is consistent with Nevada State Law and Federal Law. The water will be managed under the District's discretion and may be stored in Lahontan Reservoir until needed subject to the limitations in (a)(3) of this section.

(3) The amount of incentive water stored in Lahontan Reservoir will be reduced under the following conditions:

(i) There is a deficit created and remaining in Lahontan Reservoir from operations penalties in a prior year;

(ii) The District releases the water from the reservoir for its designated use;

(iii) During a spill of the reservoir, the amount of incentive water must be reduced by the amount of spill; and

(iv) At the discretion of the District, incentive water may be used to offset the precautionary drawdown adjustment to the Lahontan storage objective.

(v) At the end of each year, the amount of incentive water will be reduced by the incremental amount of evaporation which occurs as a result of the increased surface area of the reservoir due to the additional storage. The evaporation rate used will be either the net evaporation measured or the net historical average after precipitation is taken into account. The method of calculation will be agreed to by the District and the Bureau in advance of any storage credit.

(b) An example of this concept is:

Example:Incentive Operation—(1) At the end of the 1996 irrigation season, the Bureau and the District audit the District's water records for 1996. The District's water delivery records show that 194,703 acre-feet of water were delivered to farm headgates. On the basis of their irrigated acreage that year (59,075) the farm headgate entitlement would have been 216,337 acre-feet. On the basis of 90 percent deliveries for 59,075 acres (194,203 divided by 216,337 = 0.90) the established Project efficiency requirement was 65.1 percent.

(2) On the basis of the established Project efficiency (66.1 percent), the Project diversion required to make the headgate deliveries would be expected to be 291,909 acre-feet (194,703 divided by 0.651 = 291,909). An examination of Project records reveals that the District only diverted 286,328 acre-feet which demonstrated actual Project efficiency was 68 percent and exceeded requirements of this part.

(3) The 5,581 acre-feet of savings (291,909-286,328 = 5,581) constitutes the savings achieved through efficiency improvements and the District would then be credited two-thirds (3,721 acre-feet = 5,581 × 2/3) of this water (deemed to be Carson River water savings) as incentive water.

(4) This incentive water may be stored in Lahontan Reservoir or otherwise used by the District in its discretion consistent with State and Federal Law (e.g., power generation, recreation storage, wildlife, drought protection, etc.).
