##### § 428.8 What can happen if a farm operator makes false statements on the required forms. #####

If you make a false statement on the required RRA form(s), Reclamation can prosecute you under the following statement:

Under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001, it is a crime punishable by 5 years imprisonment or a fine of up to $10,000, or both, for any person knowingly and willfully to submit or cause to be submitted to any agency of the United States any false or fraudulent statement(s) as to any matter within the agency's jurisdiction. False statements by the farm operator will also result in loss of eligibility. Eligibility can only be regained upon the approval of the Commissioner.
