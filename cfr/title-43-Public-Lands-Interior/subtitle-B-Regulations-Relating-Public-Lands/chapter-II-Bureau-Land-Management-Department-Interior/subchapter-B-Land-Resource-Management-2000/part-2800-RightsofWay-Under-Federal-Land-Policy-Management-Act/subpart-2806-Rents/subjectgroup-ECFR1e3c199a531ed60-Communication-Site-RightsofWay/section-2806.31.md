##### § 2806.31 How will BLM calculate rent for a right-of-way for communication uses in the schedule? #####

(a) *Basic rule.* BLM calculates rents for:

(1) Single-use facilities by applying the rent from the communication use rent schedule (*see* § 2806.30 of this subpart) for the type of use and the population strata served; and

(2) Multiple-use facilities, whose authorizations provide for subleasing, by setting the rent of the highest value use in the facility or facilities as the base rent (taken from the rent schedule) and adding to it 25 percent of the rent from the rent schedule for all tenant uses in the facility or facilities, if a tenant use is not used as the base rent (rent = base rent + 25 percent of all rent due to additional tenant uses in the facility or facilities) (see also §§ 2806.32 and 2806.34 of this subpart).

(b) *Exclusions.* When calculating rent, BLM will exclude customer uses, except as provided for at §§ 2806.34(b)(4) and 2806.42 of this subpart. BLM will also exclude those uses exempted from rent by § 2806.14 of this subpart, and any uses whose rent has been waived or reduced to zero as described in § 2806.15 of this subpart.

(c) *Annual statement.* By October 15 of each year, you, as a grant or lease holder, must submit to BLM a certified statement listing any tenants and customers in your facility or facilities and the category of use for each tenant or customer as of September 30 of the same year. BLM may require you to submit any additional information needed to calculate your rent. BLM will determine the rent based on the certified statement provided. We require only facility owners or facility managers to hold a grant or lease (unless you are an occupant in a federally-owned facility as described in § 2806.42 of this subpart), and will charge you rent for your grant or lease based on the total number of communication uses within the right-of-way and the type of uses and population strata the facility or site serves.
