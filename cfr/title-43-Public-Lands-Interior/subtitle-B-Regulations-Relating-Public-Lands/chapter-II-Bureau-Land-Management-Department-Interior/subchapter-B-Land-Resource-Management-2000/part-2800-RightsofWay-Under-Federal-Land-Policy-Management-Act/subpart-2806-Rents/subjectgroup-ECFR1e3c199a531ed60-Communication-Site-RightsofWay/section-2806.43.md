##### ยง 2806.43 How does BLM calculate rent for passive reflectors and local exchange networks? #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 92217, December 19, 2016.

(a) BLM calculates rent for passive reflectors and local exchange networks by using the same rent schedules for passive reflectors and local exchange networks as the Forest Service uses for the region in which the facilities are located. You may obtain the pertinent schedules from the Forest Service or from any BLM state or field office in the region in question. For passive reflectors and local exchange networks not covered by a Forest Service regional schedule, BLM uses the provisions in ยง 2806.50 of this subpart to determine rent. See Forest Service regulations at 36 CFR chapter II.

(b) For the purposes of this subpart, the term:

(1) *Passive reflector* includes various types of nonpowered reflector devices used to bend or ricochet electronic signals between active relay stations or between an active relay station and a terminal. A passive reflector commonly serves a microwave communication system. The reflector requires point-to-point line-of-sight with the connecting relay stations, but does not require electric power; and

(2) *Local exchange network* means radio service which provides basic telephone service, primarily to rural communities.
