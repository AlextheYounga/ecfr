##### ยง 2806.50 How will BLM determine the rent for a grant when neither the linear rent schedule at ยง 2806.20 nor the communication use rent schedule at ยง 2806.30 applies? #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 92217, December 19, 2016.

When neither the linear nor the communication use rent schedule is appropriate, BLM determines your rent through a process based on comparable commercial practices, appraisals, competitive bid, or other reasonable methods. BLM will notify you in writing of the rent determination. If you disagree with the rent determination, you may appeal BLM's final determination under ยง 2801.10 of this part.
