##### § 2806.13 What happens if I pay the rent late? #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 92216, December 19, 2016.

(a) If BLM does not receive the rent payment within 15 calendar days after the rent was due under § 2806.12 of this subpart, BLM will charge you a late payment fee of $25.00 or 10 percent of the rent you owe, whichever is greater, not to exceed $500 per authorization.

(b) If BLM does not receive your rent payment and late payment fee within 30 calendar days after rent was due, BLM may collect other administrative fees provided by statute.

(c) If BLM does not receive your rent, late payment fee, and any administrative fees within 90 calendar days after the rent was due, BLM may terminate your grant under § 2807.17 of this part and you may not remove any facility or equipment without BLM's written permission (*see* § 2807.19 of this part). The rent due, late payment fees, and any administrative fees remain a debt that you owe to the United States.

(d) If you pay the rent, late payment fee, and any administrative fees after BLM has terminated the grant, BLM does not automatically reinstate the grant. You must file a new application with BLM. BLM will consider the history of your failure to timely pay rent in deciding whether to issue you a new grant.

(e) You may appeal any adverse decision BLM takes against your grant under § 2801.10 of this part.
