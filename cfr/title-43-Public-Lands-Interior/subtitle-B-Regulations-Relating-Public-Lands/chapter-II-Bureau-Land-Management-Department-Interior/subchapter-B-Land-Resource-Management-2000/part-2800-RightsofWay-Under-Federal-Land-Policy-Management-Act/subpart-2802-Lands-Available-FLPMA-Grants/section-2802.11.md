##### ยง 2802.11 How does BLM designate corridors? #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 92207, December 19, 2016.

(a) BLM may determine the locations and boundaries of right-of-way corridors during the land-use planning process described in part 1600 of this chapter. During this process BLM coordinates with other Federal agencies, state, local, and tribal governments, and the public to identify resource-related issues, concerns, and needs. The process results in a resource management plan or plan amendment, which addresses to what extent you may use public lands and resources for specific purposes.

(b) When determining which lands may be suitable for right-of-way corridors, the factors BLM considers include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) Federal, state, and local land use plans, and applicable Federal, state, local, and tribal laws;

(2) Environmental impacts on cultural resources and natural resources, including air, water, soil, fish, wildlife, and vegetation;

(3) Physical effects and constraints on corridor placement due to geology, hydrology, meteorology, soil, or land forms;

(4) Costs of construction, operation, and maintenance and costs of modifying or relocating existing facilities in a proposed right-of-way corridor (i.e., the economic efficiency of placing a right-of-way within a proposed corridor);

(5) Risks to national security;

(6) Potential health and safety hazards imposed on the public by facilities or activities located within the proposed right-of-way corridor;

(7) Social and economic impacts of the right-of-way corridor on public land users, adjacent landowners, and other groups or individuals;

(8) Transportation and utility corridor studies previously developed by user groups; and

(9) Engineering and technological compatibility of proposed and existing facilities.

(c) BLM may designate any transportation and utility corridor existing prior to October 21, 1976, as a transportation and utility corridor without further review.

(d) The resource management plan or plan amendment may also identify areas where BLM will not allow right-of-way corridors for environmental, safety, or other reasons.
