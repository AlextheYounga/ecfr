##### ยง 2807.21 May I assign my grant? #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 92223, December 19, 2016.

(a) With BLM's approval, you may assign, in whole or in part, any right or interest in a grant.

(b) In order to assign a grant, the proposed assignee must file an application and satisfy the same procedures and standards as for a new grant, including paying processing fees (*see* subpart 2804 of this part).

(c) The assignment application must also include:

(1) Documentation that the assignor agrees to the assignment; and

(2) A signed statement that the proposed assignee agrees to comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions of the grant that is being assigned and all applicable laws and regulations.

(d) BLM will not recognize an assignment until it approves it in writing. BLM will approve the assignment if doing so is in the public interest. BLM may modify the grant or add bonding and other requirements, including additional terms and conditions, to the grant when approving the assignment. BLM may decrease rents if the new holder qualifies for an exemption (*see* ยง 2806.14 of this part), or waiver or reduction (*see* ยง 2806.15 of this part) and the previous holder did not. Similarly, BLM may increase rents if the previous holder qualified for an exemption or waiver or reduction and the new holder does not. If BLM approves the assignment, the benefits and liabilities of the grant apply to the new grant holder.

(e) The processing time and conditions described at ยง 2804.25(c) of this part apply to assignment applications.
