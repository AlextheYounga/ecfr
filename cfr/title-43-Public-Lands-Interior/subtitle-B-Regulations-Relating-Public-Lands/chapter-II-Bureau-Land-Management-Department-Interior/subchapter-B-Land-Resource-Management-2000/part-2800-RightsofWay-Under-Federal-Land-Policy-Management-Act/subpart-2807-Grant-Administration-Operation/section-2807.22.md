BLM will renew the grant if you are complying with the terms, conditions, and stipulations of the grant and applicable laws and regulations.

In your application you must show that you are complying with the terms, conditions, and stipulations of the grant and applicable laws and regulations. BLM has the discretion to renew the grant if doing so is in the public interest.

(c) Submit your application under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section and include the same information necessary for a new application (*see* subpart 2804 of this part).
