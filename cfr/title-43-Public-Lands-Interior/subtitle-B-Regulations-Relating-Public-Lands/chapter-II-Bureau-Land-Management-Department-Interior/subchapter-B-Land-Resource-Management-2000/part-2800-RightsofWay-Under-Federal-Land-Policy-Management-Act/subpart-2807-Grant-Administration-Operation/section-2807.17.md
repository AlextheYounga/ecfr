##### ยง 2807.17 Under what conditions may BLM suspend or terminate my grant? #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 92223, December 19, 2016.

(a) BLM may suspend or terminate your grant if you do not comply with applicable laws and regulations or any terms, conditions, or stipulations of the grant (such as rent payments), or if you abandon the right-of-way.

(b) A grant also terminates when:

(1) The grant contains a term or condition that has been met that requires the grant to terminate;

(2) BLM consents in writing to your request to terminate the grant; or

(3) It is required by law to terminate.

(c) Your failure to use your right-of-way for its authorized purpose for any continuous 5-year period creates a presumption of abandonment. BLM will notify you in writing of this presumption. You may rebut the presumption of abandonment by proving that you used the right-of-way or that your failure to use the right-of-way was due to circumstances beyond your control, such as acts of God, war, or casualties not attributable to you.

(d) You may appeal a decision under this section under ยง 2801.10 of this part.
