You do not have to file an application using Standard Form 299 if:

(a) BLM determines that competition exists (*see* ยง 2804.23(c) of this subpart); or

(b) You are an oil and gas operator. You may include your right-of-way requirements for a FLPMA grant as part of your Application for Permit to Drill or Sundry Notice under the regulations in parts 3160 through 3190 of this chapter.
