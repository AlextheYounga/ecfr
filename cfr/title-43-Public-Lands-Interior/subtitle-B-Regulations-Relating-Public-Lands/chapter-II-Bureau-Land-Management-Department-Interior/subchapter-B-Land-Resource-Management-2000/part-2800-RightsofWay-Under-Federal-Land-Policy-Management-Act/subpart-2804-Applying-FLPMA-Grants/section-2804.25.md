##### § 2804.25 How will BLM process my application? #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 92209, December 19, 2016.

(a) BLM will notify you in writing when it receives your application and will identify your processing fee described at § 2804.14 of this subpart.

(b) BLM may require you to submit additional information necessary to process the application. This information may include a detailed construction, operation, rehabilitation, and environmental protection plan, *i.e.*, a “Plan of Development,” and any needed cultural resource surveys or inventories for threatened or endangered species. If BLM needs more information, we will identify this information in a written deficiency notice asking you to provide the additional information within a specified period of time. BLM will notify you of any other grant applications which involve all or part of the lands for which you applied.

(c) *Customer service standard.* BLM will process your completed application as follows:

|Processing category|          Processing time           |                                                                                                         Conditions                                                                                                          |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|        1-4        |          60 calendar days          |If processing your application will take longer than 60 calendar days, BLM will notify you in writing of this fact prior to the 30th calendar day and inform you of when you can expect a final decision on your application.|
|         5         |As specified in the Master Agreement|                                                                                BLM will process applications as specified in the Agreement.                                                                                 |
|         6         |       Over 60 calendar days        |                                                        BLM will notify you in writing within the initial 60-day processing period of the estimated processing time.                                                         |

(d) Before issuing a grant, BLM will:

(1) Complete a NEPA analysis for the application or approve a NEPA analysis previously completed for the application, as required by 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508;

(2) Determine whether or not your proposed use complies with applicable Federal and state laws;

(3) If your application is for a road, determine whether it is in the public interest to require you to grant the United States an equivalent authorization across lands that you own;

(4) Consult, as necessary, with other governmental entities;

(5) Hold public meetings if sufficient public interest exists to warrant their time and expense. BLM will publish a notice in the Federal Register, a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the lands involved, or both, announcing in advance any public hearings or meetings; and

(6) Take any other action necessary to fully evaluate and decide whether to approve or deny your application.

(e)(1) The BLM may segregate, if it finds it necessary for the orderly administration of the public lands, lands included in a right-of-way application under 43 CFR subpart 2804 for the generation of electrical energy from wind or solar sources. In addition, the Bureau of Land Management may also segregate lands that it identifies for potential rights-of-way for electricity generation from wind or solar sources when initiating a competitive process for solar or wind development on particular lands. Upon segregation, such lands would not be subject to appropriation under the public land laws, including location under the Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 22 *et seq.*), but would remain open under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 181 *et seq.*) or the Materials Act of 1947 (30 U.S.C. 601 *et seq.*). The BLM would effect a segregation by publishing a Federal Register notice that includes a description of the lands being segregated. The BLM may effect segregation in this way for both pending and new right-of-way applications.

(2) The effective date of segregation is the date of publication of the notice in the Federal Register. Consistent with 43 CFR 2091-3.2, the segregation terminates and the lands automatically open on the date that is the earliest of the following:

(i) When the BLM issues a decision granting, granting with modifications, or denying the application for a right-of-way;

(ii) Automatically at the end of the segregation period stated in the Federal Register notice initiating the segregation; or

(iii) Upon publication of a Federal Register notice terminating the segregation and opening the lands.

(3) The segregation period may not exceed 2 years from the date of publication in the Federal Register of the notice initiating the segregation, unless the State Director determines and documents in writing, prior to the expiration of the segregation period, that an extension is necessary for the orderly administration of the public lands. If the State Director determines an extension is necessary, the BLM will extend the segregation for up to 2 years by publishing a notice in the Federal Register, prior to the expiration of the initial segregation period. Segregations under this part may only be extended once and the total segregation period may not exceed 4 years.
