(c) Retain ownership of the resources of the land, including timber and vegetative or mineral materials and any other living or non-living resources. You have no right to use these resources, except as noted in ยง 2805.14(e) of this subpart;

(d) Determine whether or not your grant is renewable; and

(e) Change the terms and conditions of your grant as a result of changes in legislation, regulation, or as otherwise necessary to protect public health or safety or the environment.
