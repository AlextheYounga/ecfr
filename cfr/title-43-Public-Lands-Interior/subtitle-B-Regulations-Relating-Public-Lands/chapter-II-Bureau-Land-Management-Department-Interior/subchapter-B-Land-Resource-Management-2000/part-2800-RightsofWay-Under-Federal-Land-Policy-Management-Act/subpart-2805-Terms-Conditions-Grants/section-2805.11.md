(1) You will occupy with authorized facilities;

(2) Are necessary for constructing, operating, maintaining, and terminating the authorized facilities;

(3) Are necessary to protect the public health and safety;

(4) Will not unnecessarily damage the environment; and

(5) Will not result in unnecessary or undue degradation.

(b) *How long you can use the right-of-way.* Each grant will state the length of time that you are authorized to use the right-of-way.

(1) BLM will consider the following factors in establishing a reasonable term:

(i) The public purpose served;

(ii) Cost and useful life of the facility;

(iii) Time limitations imposed by licenses or permits required by other Federal agencies and state, tribal, or local governments; and

(iv) The time necessary to accomplish the purpose of the grant.

(2) All grants, except those issued for a term of 3 years or less and those issued in perpetuity, will expire on December 31 of the final year of the grant.

(c) *How you can use the right-of-way.* You may only use the right-of-way for the specific use the grant authorizes.
