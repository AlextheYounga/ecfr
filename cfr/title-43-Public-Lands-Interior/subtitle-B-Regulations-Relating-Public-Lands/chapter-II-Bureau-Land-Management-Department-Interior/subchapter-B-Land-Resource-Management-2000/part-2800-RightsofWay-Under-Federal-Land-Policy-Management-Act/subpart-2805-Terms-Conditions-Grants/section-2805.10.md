Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 92212, December 19, 2016.

(a) BLM will send you a written response on your application. If we do not deny the application, we will send you an unsigned grant for your review and signature that:

(1) Includes any terms, conditions, and stipulations that BLM determines to be in the public interest. This includes modifying your proposed use or changing the route or location of the facilities;

(2) May include terms that prevent your use of the right-of-way until you have an approved Plan of Development and BLM has issued a Notice to Proceed; and

(3) Will impose a specific term for the grant. Each grant that BLM issues for 20 or more years will contain a provision requiring periodic review at the end of the twentieth year and subsequently at 10-year intervals. BLM may change the terms and conditions of the grant as a result of these reviews in accordance with § 2805.15(e) of this subpart.

(b) If you agree with the terms and conditions of the unsigned grant, you should sign and return it to BLM with any payment required under § 2805.16 of this subpart. BLM will sign the grant and return it to you with a final decision issuing the grant if the regulations in this part, including § 2804.26, remain satisfied. You may appeal this decision under § 2801.10 of this part.

(c) If BLM denies your application, we will send you a written decision that will:

(1) State the reasons for the denial (*see* § 2804.26 of this part);

(2) Identify any processing costs you must pay (*see* § 2804.14 of this part); and

(3) Notify you of your right to appeal this decision under § 2801.10 of this part.
