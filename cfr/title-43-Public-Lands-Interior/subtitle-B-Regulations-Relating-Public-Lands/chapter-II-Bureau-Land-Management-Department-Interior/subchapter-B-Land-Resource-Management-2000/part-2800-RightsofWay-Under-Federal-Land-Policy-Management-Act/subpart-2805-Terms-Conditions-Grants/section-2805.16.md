(a) *Monitoring fees.* You must pay a fee to BLM for the reasonable costs the Federal government incurs in monitoring the construction, operation, maintenance, and termination of the project and protection and rehabilitation of the public lands your grant covers. BLM categorizes the monitoring fees based on the estimated number of work hours necessary to monitor your grant. Monitoring Category 1 through 4 fees are one-time fees and are not refundable.
