##### ยง 2885.20 How will the BLM calculate my rent for linear rights-of-way the Per Acre Rent Schedule covers? #####

(a) Except as provided by ยง 2885.22, the BLM calculates your rent by multiplying the rent per acre for the appropriate county (or other geographical area) zone from the current schedule by the number of acres (as rounded up to the nearest tenth of an acre) in the right-of-way or TUP area that fall in each zone and multiplying the result by the number of years in the rental payment period (the length of time for which the holder is paying rent).

(b) You may obtain a copy of the current Per Acre Rent Schedule from any BLM State, district, or field office or by writing: U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, 20 M Street SE., Room 2134LM, Washington, DC 20003. The BLM also posts the current rent schedule at *http://www.blm.gov.*

(c) If the BLM has not previously used the rent schedule to calculate your rent, we may do so after giving you reasonable written notice.
