##### § 2884.12 What is the processing fee for a grant or TUP application? #####

(a) You must pay a processing fee with the application to cover the costs to the Federal Government of processing your application before the Federal Government incurs them. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, if processing your application will involve Federal agencies other than the BLM, your fee may also include the reasonable costs estimated to be incurred by those Federal agencies. Instead of paying the BLM a fee for the estimated work of other Federal agencies in processing your application, you may pay other Federal agencies directly for the costs estimated to be incurred by them in processing your application. The fees for Processing Categories 1 through 4 are one-time fees and are not refundable. The fees are categorized based on an estimate of the amount of time that the Federal Government will expend to process your application and issue a decision granting or denying the application.

(b) There is no processing fee if work is estimated to take 1 hour or less. Processing fees are based on categories. We update the processing fees for Categories 1 through 4 in the schedule each calendar year, based on the previous year's change in the IPD-GDP, as measured second quarter to second quarter. We will round these changes to the nearest dollar. We will update Category 5 processing fees as specified in the Master Agreement. These processing categories and the estimated range of Federal work hours for each category are:

|(6) Applications for new grants or TUPs, assignments, renewals, and amendments to existing grants or TUPs|  Estimated Federal work hours are \>50.  |

(c) You may obtain a copy of the current schedule from any BLM State, district, or field office or by writing: U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, 20 M Street SE., Room 2134LM, Washington, DC 20003. The BLM also posts the current schedule at *http://www.blm.gov.*

(d) After an initial review of your application, BLM will notify you of the processing category into which your application fits. You must then submit the appropriate payment for that category before BLM begins processing your application. Your signature on a cost recovery Master Agreement constitutes your agreement with the processing category decision. If you disagree with the category that BLM has determined for your application, you may appeal the decision under § 2881.10 of this part. If you paid the processing fee and you appeal a Processing Category 1 through 4 or a Processing Category 6 determination to IBLA, BLM will process your application while the appeal is pending. If IBLA finds in your favor, you will receive a refund or adjustment of your processing fee.

(e) In processing your application, BLM may determine at any time that the application requires preparing an EIS. If this occurs, BLM will send you a decision changing your processing category to Processing Category 6. You may appeal the decision under § 2881.10 of this part.

(f) If you hold an authorization relating to TAPS, BLM will send you a written statement seeking reimbursement of actual costs within 60 calendar days after the close of each quarter. Quarters end on the last day of March, June, September, and December. In processing applications and administering authorizations relating to TAPS, the Department of the Interior will avoid unnecessary employment of personnel and needless expenditure of funds.
