(a) When BLM receives your application, it will publish a notice in the Federal Register or a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the lands involved. If BLM determines the pipeline(s) will have only minor environmental impacts, it is not required to publish this notice. The notice will, at a minimum, contain:

(1) A description of the pipeline system; and

(2) A statement of where the application and related documents are available for review.

(b) BLM will send copies of the published notice for review and comment to the:

(1) Governor of each state within which the pipeline system would be located;

(2) Head of each local or tribal government or jurisdiction within which the pipeline system would be located; and

(3) Heads of other Federal agencies whose jurisdiction includes lands within which the pipeline system would be located.

(c) If your application involves a pipeline that is 24 inches or more in diameter, BLM will also send notice of the application to the appropriate committees of Congress in accordance with 30 U.S.C. 185(w).

(d) BLM may hold public hearings or meetings on your application if we determine there is sufficient interest to warrant the time and expense of such hearings or meetings. BLM will publish a notice of any such hearings or meetings in advance in the Federal Register or in a newspaper of general circulation in the vicinity of the lands involved.
