##### § 2883.14 What happens to my application, grant, or TUP if I die? #####

(a) If an applicant or grant or TUP holder dies, any inheritable interest in the application, grant, or TUP will be distributed under state law.

(b) If the distributee of a grant or TUP is not qualified to hold a grant or TUP under § 2883.10 of this subpart, BLM will recognize the distributee as grant or TUP holder and allow the distributee to hold its interest in the grant or TUP for up to two years.
