*Conformity or conformance* means that a resource management action shall be clearly consistent with the plan components of the approved resource management plan (see § 1610.6-3).

*Consistent with officially approved and adopted plans* means that resource management plans are compatible with the terms, conditions, and decisions of officially approved and adopted plans of other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes, to the maximum extent the BLM finds consistent with the purposes of FLPMA and other Federal law and regulations applicable to public lands, and the purposes, policies and programs implementing such laws and regulations, and subject to the qualifications in § 1610.3-3.

*Cooperating agency* means an eligible governmental entity (see 43 CFR 46.225(a)) that has entered into an agreement with the BLM to participate in the development of an environmental impact statement or environmental assessment as a cooperating agency under the National Environmental Policy Act and in the planning process as described in § 1610.3-2 of this part. The BLM and the cooperating agency will work together under the terms of the agreement.

*Mitigation* means the sequence of avoiding impacts, minimizing impacts, and compensating for remaining unavoidable impacts.

*Multiple use* means the management of the public lands and their various resource values so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people; making the most judicious use of the lands for some or all of these resources or related services over areas large enough to provide sufficient latitude for periodic adjustments in use to conform to changing needs and conditions; the use of some lands for less than all of the resources; a combination of balanced and diverse resource uses that takes into account the long term needs of future generations for renewable and non-renewable resources, including, but not limited to, recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish, and natural scenic, scientific and historical values; and harmonious and coordinated management of the various resources without permanent impairment of the productivity of the lands and the quality of the environment with consideration being given to the relative values of the resources and not necessarily to the combination of uses that will give the greatest economic return or the greatest unit output.
