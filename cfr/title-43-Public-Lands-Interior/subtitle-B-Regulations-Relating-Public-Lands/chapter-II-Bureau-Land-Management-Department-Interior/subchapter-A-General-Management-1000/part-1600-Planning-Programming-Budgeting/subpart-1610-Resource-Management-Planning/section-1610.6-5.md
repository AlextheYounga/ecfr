##### § 1610.6-5 Maintenance. #####

Resource management plans may be maintained as necessary to correct typographical or mapping errors or to reflect minor changes in mapping or data. Maintenance shall not change a plan component of the approved resource management plan, except to correct typographical or mapping errors or to reflect minor changes in mapping or data. Maintenance is not considered a resource management plan amendment and shall not require the formal public involvement and interagency coordination process described under §§ 1610.2 and 1610.3 of this part or the preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement. When changes are made to an approved resource management plan through plan maintenance, the BLM shall notify the public and make the changes available for public review at least 30 days prior to their implementation.
