##### ยง 1610.4 Planning assessment. #####

Before initiating the preparation of a resource management plan the BLM shall, consistent with the nature, scope, scale, and timing of the planning effort, complete a planning assessment.

(a) *Planning area.* The BLM shall identify a preliminary planning area for use as the basis for the planning assessment.

(1) In identifying the preliminary planning area, the BLM shall consider the following:

(i) Management concerns identified through monitoring and evaluation (see ยง 1610.6-4);

(ii) Relevant landscapes based on these management concerns;

(iii) Director and deciding official guidance;

(iv) Officially approved and adopted plans of other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes; and

(v) Other relevant information, as appropriate.

(2) The responsible official shall make a description of and a rationale for the preliminary planning area available for public review prior to the publication of the notice of intent in the Federal Register (see ยง 1610.2-1(f)).

(b) *Information gathering.* The responsible official shall:

(1) Arrange for relevant resource, environmental, ecological, social, economic, and institutional data and information to be gathered, or assembled if already available, including the identification of potential ACECs (see ยง 1610.8-2). To the extent consistent with the laws governing the administration of the public lands and as appropriate, inventory data and information shall be gathered or assembled in coordination with the land use planning and management programs of other Federal agencies, State and local governments, and Indian tribes within which the lands are located, and in a manner that aids the planning process and avoids unnecessary data-gathering;

(2) Identify relevant national, regional, State, tribal, or local laws, regulations, policies, guidance, strategies, or plans for consideration in the planning assessment. These may include, but are not limited to, Executive or Secretarial orders, Departmental or BLM policy, Director or deciding official guidance, mitigation strategies, interagency initiatives, and State, multi-state, tribal, or local resource plans;

(3) Provide opportunities for other Federal agencies, State and local governments, Indian tribes, and the public to provide existing data and information or suggest other laws, regulations, policies, guidance, strategies, or plans described under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for the BLM's consideration in the planning assessment; and

(4) Identify relevant public views concerning resource, environmental, ecological, social, or economic conditions of the planning area.

(c) *Information quality.* The responsible official shall evaluate the data and information gathered under paragraph (b) of this section to ensure the use of high quality information in the planning assessment and to identify any data gaps or further information needs.

(d) *Assessment.* The responsible official shall assess the resource, environmental, ecological, social, and economic conditions of the planning area. At a minimum, the responsible official shall consider and document the following factors in this assessment when they are applicable:

(1) Resource use and management authorized by FLPMA and other relevant authorities;

(2) Land status and ownership, existing resource management, infrastructure, and access patterns in the planning area, including any known valid existing rights;

(3) Current resource, environmental, ecological, social, and economic conditions, and any known trends related to these conditions;

(4) Known resource constraints, or limitations;

(5) Areas of potential importance within the planning area, including:

(i) Areas of tribal, traditional, or cultural importance;

(ii) Habitat for special status species, including State or federally-listed threatened and endangered species;

(iii) Other areas of key fish and wildlife habitat such as big game wintering and summer areas, bird nesting and feeding areas, habitat connectivity or wildlife migration corridors, and areas of large and intact habitat;

(iv) Areas of ecological importance, such as areas that increase the ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems within the planning area to adapt to, resist, or recover from change;

(v) Lands with wilderness characteristics, wild and scenic study rivers, or areas of significant scientific or scenic value;

(vi) Areas of significant historical value, including paleontological sites;

(vii) Existing designations located in the planning area, such as wilderness, wilderness study areas, wild and scenic rivers, national scenic or historic trails, or ACECs;

(viii) Areas with potential for renewable or non-renewable energy development or energy transmission;

(ix) Areas with known mineral potential;

(x) Areas with known potential for producing forest products, including timber;

(xi) Areas of importance for recreation activities or access;

(xii) Areas of importance for public health and safety, such as abandoned mine lands or natural hazards;

(6) Dominant ecological processes, disturbance regimes, and stressors, such as drought, wildland fire, invasive species, and climate change; and

(7) The various goods, services, and uses that people obtain from the planning area, such as ecological services, domestic livestock grazing, fish and wildlife development and utilization, mineral exploration and production, rights-of-way, outdoor recreation, and timber production; and

(i) The degree of local, regional, national, or international importance of these goods, services, and uses;

(ii) Available forecasts and analyses related to the supply and demand for these goods, services, and uses; and

(iii) The estimated levels of these goods, services, and uses that may be produced on a sustained yield basis.

(e) *Planning assessment report.* The responsible official shall document the planning assessment in a report made available for public review prior to the publication of the notice of intent, which includes the identification and rationale for potential ACECs. To the extent practical, any non-sensitive geospatial information used in the planning assessment should be made available to the public on the BLM's Web site.

(f) *Plan amendments.* Before initiating the preparation of a plan amendment for which an environmental impact statement will be prepared, the BLM shall complete a planning assessment consistent with the requirements of this section for the geographic area being considered for amendment. The deciding official may waive this requirement for project-specific or other minor amendments.
