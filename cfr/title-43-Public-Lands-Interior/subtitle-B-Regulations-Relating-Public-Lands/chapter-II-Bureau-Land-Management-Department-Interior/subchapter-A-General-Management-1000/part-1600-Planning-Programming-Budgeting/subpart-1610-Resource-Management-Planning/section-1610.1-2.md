##### ยง 1610.1-2 Plan components. #####

(a) Plan components guide future management actions within the planning area. Resource management plans shall include the following plan components:

(1) *Goals.* A goal is a broad statement of desired outcomes addressing resource, environmental, ecological, social, or economic characteristics within the planning area, or a portion of the planning area, toward which management of the land and resources should be directed.

(2) *Objectives.* An objective is a concise statement of desired resource conditions within the planning area, or a portion of the planning area, developed to guide progress toward one or more goals. An objective is specific, measurable, and should have established time-frames for achievement. As appropriate, objectives should also:

(i) Identify standards to mitigate undesirable impacts to resource conditions;

(ii) Provide integrated consideration of resource, environmental, ecological, social, and economic factors; and

(iii) Identify indicators for evaluating progress toward achievement of the objective.

(b) Resource management plans also shall include the following plan components in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the resource management plan, or applicable legal requirements or policies, consistent with the principles of multiple use and sustained yield unless otherwise specified by law:

(1) *Designations.* A designation identifies areas of public land where management is directed toward one or more priority resource values or resource uses.

(i) Planning designations are identified through the BLM's land use planning process in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the resource management plan or applicable legal requirements or policies such as the designation of areas of critical environmental concern (ACEC) (see ยง 1610.8-2).

(ii) Non-discretionary designations are designated by the President, Congress, or the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to other legal authorities.

(2) *Resource use determinations.* A resource use determination identifies areas of public lands or mineral estate where, subject to valid existing rights, specific uses are excluded, restricted, or allowed, in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the resource management plan or applicable legal requirements or policies. Resource use determinations shall be consistent with or support the management priorities identified through designations.

(3) *Monitoring and evaluation standards.* Monitoring and evaluation standards identify indicators and intervals for monitoring and evaluation to determine whether the resource management plan objectives are being met or there is relevant new information that may warrant amendment or revision of the resource management plan.

(4) Lands identified as available for disposal from BLM administration, including sales under section 203 of FLPMA, as applicable.

(c) A plan component may only be changed through a resource management plan amendment or revision, except to correct typographical or mapping errors or to reflect minor changes in mapping or data (see ยง 1610.6-5).
