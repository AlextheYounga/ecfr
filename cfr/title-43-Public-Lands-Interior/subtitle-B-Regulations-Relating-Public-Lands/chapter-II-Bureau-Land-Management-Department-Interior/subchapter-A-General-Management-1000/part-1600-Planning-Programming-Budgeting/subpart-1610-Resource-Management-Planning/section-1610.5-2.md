##### § 1610.5-2 Formulation of resource management alternatives. #####

(a) *Alternatives development.* The BLM shall consider all reasonable resource management alternatives (alternatives) and develop several complete alternatives for detailed study. The decision to designate alternatives for further development and analysis remains the exclusive responsibility of the BLM.

(1) The alternatives developed shall be informed by the Director and deciding official guidance (see § 1610.1(a)), the planning assessment (see § 1610.4), the statement of purpose and need (see § 1610.5-1), and the planning issues (see § 1610.5-1).

(2) In order to limit the total number of alternatives analyzed in detail to a manageable number for presentation and analysis, reasonable variations may be treated as sub-alternatives.

(3) One alternative shall be for no action, which means continuation of present level or systems of resource management.

(4) The resource management plan shall note any alternatives identified and eliminated from detailed study and shall briefly discuss the reasons for their elimination.

(b) *Rationale for alternatives.* The resource management plan shall describe the rationale for the differences between alternatives. The rationale shall include:

(1) A description of how each alternative addresses the planning issues, consistent with the principles of multiple use and sustained yield, unless otherwise specified by law;

(2) A description of management direction that is common to all alternatives; and

(3) A description of how management direction varies across alternatives to address the planning issues.

(c) *Public review of preliminary alternatives.* The responsible official shall make the preliminary alternatives and the preliminary rationale for alternatives available for public review prior to the publication of the draft resource management plan and draft environmental impact statement, and as appropriate, prior to the publication of draft plan amendments when an environmental impact statement is prepared to inform the amendment.

(d) *Changes to preliminary alternatives.* The BLM may change the preliminary alternatives and preliminary rationale for alternatives as planning proceeds if it determines that public suggestions or other new information make such changes necessary. A description of these changes shall be made available to the public in the draft resource management plan (see § 1610.5-4).
