##### § 1610.9 Transition period. #####

(a) Until superseded by resource management plans, management framework plans may be the basis for considering proposed actions as follows:

(1) The management framework plan must be in compliance with the principle of multiple use and sustained yield unless otherwise specified by law, and must have been developed with public involvement and governmental coordination, but not necessarily precisely as prescribed in §§ 1610.2 and 1610.3 of this part.

(2) For proposed actions a determination shall be made by the responsible official whether the proposed action is in conformance with the management framework plan. Such determination shall be in writing and shall explain the reasons for the determination.

(i) If the proposed action is in conformance with the management framework plan, it may be further considered for decision under procedures applicable to that type of action, including the regulatory provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act.

(ii) If the proposed action is not in conformance with the management framework plan, and if the proposed action warrants further consideration before a resource management plan is scheduled for preparation, such consideration shall be through an amendment to the management framework plan under the provisions of § 1610.6-6 of this part.

(b)(1) If an action is proposed where public lands are not covered by a management framework plan or a resource management plan, an environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement, if necessary, plus any other data and analysis deemed necessary by the BLM to make an informed decision, shall be used to assess the impacts of the proposal and to provide a basis for a decision on the proposal.

(2) A land disposal action may be considered before a resource management plan is scheduled for preparation, through a planning analysis, using the process described in § 1610.6-6 of this part for amending a plan.

(c)(1) When considering whether a proposed action is in conformance with a resource management plan, the BLM shall use an existing resource management plan approved prior to January 11, 2017 until it is superseded by a resource management plan or plan amendment prepared under the regulations in this part. In such circumstances, the proposed action must either be specifically provided for in the resource management plan or clearly consistent with the terms, conditions, and decisions of the approved plan.

(2) If a resource management plan is amended by a plan amendment prepared under the regulations in this part, a future proposed action must be clearly consistent with the plan components of the provisions of the approved resource management plan amended under the regulations in this part and the terms, conditions, and decisions of the provisions of the approved resource management plan that have not been amended under the regulations in this part.

(d) If the preparation, revision, or amendment of a plan was formally initiated by issuance of a notice of intent in the Federal Register prior to January 11, 2017, the BLM may complete and approve the resource management plan or plan amendment pursuant to the requirements of this part or to the provisions of the planning regulations in 43 CFR part 1600 in effect prior to the effective date of this rule.
