##### § 1610.6-8 Situations where action can be taken based on another agency's planning documents. #####

These regulations authorize the preparation of a resource management plan for whatever public land interests exist in a given land area, including mixed ownership where the public land estate is under non-Federal surface, or administration of the land is shared by the BLM and another Federal agency. The BLM may rely on the planning documents of other agencies when split or shared estate conditions exist in any of the following situations:

(a) Another agency's plan (Federal, tribal, State, or local) may be relied on as a basis for an action only if it is comprehensive and has considered the public land interest involved in a way comparable to the manner in which it would have been considered in a resource management plan, including the opportunity for public involvement, and is consistent with Federal laws and regulations applicable to public lands, and the purposes, policies and programs implementing such laws and regulations.

(b) After evaluation and review, the BLM may adopt another agency's plan for continued use as a resource management plan so long as the plan is consistent with Federal laws and regulations applicable to public lands, and the purposes, policies, and programs implementing such laws and regulations, and an agreement is reached between the BLM and the other agency to provide for maintenance and amendment of the plan, as necessary.

(c) Another agency's resource assessment may be relied on only if it is comprehensive and has considered the resource, environmental, ecological, social, and economic conditions in a way comparable to the manner in which these conditions would have been considered in a planning assessment (see § 1610.4), including the opportunity for public involvement, and is consistent with Federal laws and regulations applicable to public lands, and the purposes, policies, and programs implementing such laws and regulations.

(d) A land use analysis may be relied on to consider a coal lease when there is no Federal ownership interest in the surface or when coal resources are insufficient to justify plan preparation costs. The land use analysis process, as authorized by the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act, consists of an environmental assessment or impact statement, public involvement as required by § 1610.2, the consultation and consistency determinations required by § 1610.3, the protest procedure prescribed by § 1610.6-2, and a decision on the coal lease proposal. A land use analysis meets the planning requirements of section 202 of FLPMA.
