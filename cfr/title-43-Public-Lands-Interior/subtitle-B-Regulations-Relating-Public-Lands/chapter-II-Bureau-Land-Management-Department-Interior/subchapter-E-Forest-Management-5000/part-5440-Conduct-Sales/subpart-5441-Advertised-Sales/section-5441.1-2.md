Where a timber sale notice provides that the successful bidder may use a Small Business Administration road construction loan, and the bidder has reason to believe that he qualifies for such road construction loan under SBA regulations (13 CFR part 121), the bidder shall submit to the authorized officer a statement of his intention to file with SBA for such SBA road construction loan.
