(b) *Terms.* As used in this part, the term:

*Acreage rent* means rent assessed for solar and wind energy development grants and leases that is determined by the number of acres authorized for the grant or lease.

*Act* means the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*).

*Actual costs* means the financial measure of resources the Federal government expends or uses in processing a right-of-way application or in monitoring the construction, operation, and termination of a facility authorized by a grant or permit. Actual costs includes both direct and indirect costs, exclusive of management overhead costs.

*Application filing fee* means a filing fee specific to solar and wind energy applications. This fee is an initial payment for the reasonable costs for processing, inspecting, and monitoring a right-of-way.

*Assignment* means the transfer, in whole or in part, of any right or interest in a right-of-way grant or lease from the holder (assignor) to a subsequent party (assignee) with the BLM's written approval. A change in ownership of the grant or lease, or other related change-in-control transaction involving the holder, including a merger or acquisition, also constitutes an assignment for purposes of these regulations requiring the BLM's written approval, unless applicable statutory authority provides otherwise.

*Base rent* means the dollar amount required from a grant or lease holder on BLM managed lands based on the communication use with the highest value in the associated facility or facilities, as calculated according to the communication use rent schedule. If a facility manager's or facility owner's scheduled rent is equal to the highest rent charged a tenant in the facility or facilities, then the facility manager's or facility owner's use determines the dollar amount of the base rent. Otherwise, the facility owner's, facility manager's, customer's, or tenant's use with the highest value, and which is not otherwise excluded from rent, determines the base rent.

*Casual use* means activities ordinarily resulting in no or negligible disturbance of the public lands, resources, or improvements. *Examples of casual use include:* Surveying, marking routes, and collecting data to use to prepare grant applications.

*Commercial purpose or activity* refers to the circumstance where a holder attempts to produce a profit by allowing the use of its facilities by an additional party. BLM may assess an appropriate rent for such commercial activities. The holder's use may not otherwise be subject to rent charges under BLM's rental provisions.

*Communication use rent schedule* is a schedule of rents for the following types of communication uses, including related technologies, located in a facility associated with a particular grant or lease. All use categories include ancillary communications equipment, such as internal microwave or internal one-or two-way radio, that are directly related to operating, maintaining, and monitoring the primary uses listed below. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) may or may not license the primary uses. The type of use and community served, identified on an FCC license, if one has been issued, do not supersede either the definitions in this subpart or the procedures in § 2806.30 of this part for calculating rent for communication facilities and uses located on public land:

(1) *Television broadcast* means a use that broadcasts UHF and VHF audio and video signals for general public reception. This category does not include low-power television (LPTV) or rebroadcast devices, such as translators, or transmitting devices, such as microwave relays serving broadcast translators;

*Megawatt (MW) capacity fee* means the fee paid in addition to the acreage rent for solar and wind energy development grants and leases. The MW capacity fee is the approved MW capacity of the solar or wind energy grant or lease multiplied by the appropriate MW rate. A grant or lease may provide for stages of development, and the grantee or lessee will be charged a fee for each stage by multiplying the MW rate by the approved MW capacity for the stage of the project.

*Megawatt rate* means the price of each MW of capacity for various solar and wind energy technologies as determined by the MW rate formula. Current MW rates are found on the BLM's MW rate schedule, which can be obtained at any BLM office or at *http://www.blm.gov.* The MW rate is calculated by multiplying the total hours per year by the net capacity factor, by the MW hour (MWh) price, and by the rate of return, where:

(1) *Net capacity factor* means the average operational time divided by the average potential operational time of a solar or wind energy development, multiplied by the current technology efficiency rates. The BLM establishes net capacity factors for different technology types but may determine another net capacity factor to be more appropriate, on a case-by-case or regional basis, to reflect changes in technology, such as a solar or wind project that employs energy storage technologies, or if a grant or lease holder or applicant is able to demonstrate that another net capacity factor is appropriate for a particular project or region. The net capacity factor for each technology type is:
