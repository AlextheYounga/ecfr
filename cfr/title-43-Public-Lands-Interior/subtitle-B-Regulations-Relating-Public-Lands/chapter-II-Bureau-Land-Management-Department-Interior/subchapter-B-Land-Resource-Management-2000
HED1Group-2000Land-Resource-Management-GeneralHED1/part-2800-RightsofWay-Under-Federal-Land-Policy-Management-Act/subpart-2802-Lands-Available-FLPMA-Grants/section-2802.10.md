##### § 2802.10 What lands are available for grants? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 25959, Apr. 12, 2024.

(a) In its discretion, BLM may grant rights-of-way on any lands under its jurisdiction except when:

(1) A statute, regulation, or public land order specifically excludes rights-of-way;

(2) The lands are specifically segregated or withdrawn from right-of-way uses; or

(3) BLM identifies areas in its land use plans or in the analysis of an application as inappropriate for right-of-way uses.

(b) BLM may require common use of a right-of-way and may require, to the extent practical, location of new rights-of-way within existing or designated right-of-way corridors (*see* § 2802.11 of this subpart). Safety and other considerations may limit the extent to which you may share a right-of-way. BLM will designate right-of-way corridors through land use plan decisions.

(c) You should contact the BLM office nearest the lands you seek to use to:

(1) Determine whether or not the land you want to use is available for that use; and

(2) Begin discussions about any application you may need to file.
