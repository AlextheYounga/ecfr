The grant conveys to you only those rights which it expressly contains. BLM issues it subject to the valid existing rights of others, including the United States. Rights which the grant conveys to you include the right to:

(a) Use the described lands to construct, operate, maintain, and terminate facilities within the right-of-way for authorized purposes under the terms and conditions of the grant;

(b) If your grant specifically authorizes, allow other parties to use your facility for the purposes specified in your grant and you may charge for such use. If your grant does not specifically authorize it, you may not let anyone else use your facility and you may not charge for its use unless BLM authorizes or requires it in writing;

(c) Allow others to use the land as your agent in the exercise of the rights that the grant specifies;

(d) Do minor trimming, pruning, and removing of vegetation to maintain the right-of-way or facility;

(e) Use common varieties of stone and soil which are necessarily removed during construction of the project, without additional BLM authorization or payment, in constructing the project within the authorized right-of-way;

(f) Assign the grant to another, provided that you obtain the BLM's prior written approval, unless your grant specifically states that that such approval is unnecessary; and

(g) Apply to renew your solar or wind energy development grant or lease, under § 2807.22; and

(h) Apply to renew your energy project-area testing grant for one additional term of 3 years or less when the renewal application also includes an energy development application under § 2801.9(d)(2).
