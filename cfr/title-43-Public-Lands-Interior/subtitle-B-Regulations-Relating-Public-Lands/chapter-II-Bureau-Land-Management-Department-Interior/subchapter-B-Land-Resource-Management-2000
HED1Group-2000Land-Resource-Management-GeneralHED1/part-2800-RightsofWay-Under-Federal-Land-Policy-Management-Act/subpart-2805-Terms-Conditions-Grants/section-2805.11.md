(3) Are necessary to protect the public health and safety;

(4) Will not unnecessarily damage the environment; and

(5) Will not result in unnecessary or undue degradation.

(b) *How long you can use the right-of-way.* Each grant will state the length of time that you are authorized to use the right-of-way.

(1) BLM will consider the following factors in establishing a reasonable term:

(i) The public purpose served;

(ii) Cost and useful life of the facility;

(iii) Time limitations imposed by licenses or permits required by other Federal agencies and state, tribal, or local governments; and

(iv) The time necessary to accomplish the purpose of the grant.

(i) For an energy site-specific testing grant, the term is 3 years or less, without the option of renewal;

(ii) For an energy project-area testing grant, the initial term is 3 years or less, with the option to renew for one additional 3-year period when the renewal application is also accompanied by a solar or wind energy development application and a POD as required by ยง 2804.25(e)(3);

(iii) For a short-term grant for all other associated actions not specifically included in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, such as geotechnical testing and other temporary land disturbing activities, the term is 3 years or less;

(iv) For solar and wind energy development grants, the term is up to 30 years (plus the initial partial year of issuance) with adjustable terms and conditions. The grantee may submit an application for renewal under ยง 2805.14(g); and
