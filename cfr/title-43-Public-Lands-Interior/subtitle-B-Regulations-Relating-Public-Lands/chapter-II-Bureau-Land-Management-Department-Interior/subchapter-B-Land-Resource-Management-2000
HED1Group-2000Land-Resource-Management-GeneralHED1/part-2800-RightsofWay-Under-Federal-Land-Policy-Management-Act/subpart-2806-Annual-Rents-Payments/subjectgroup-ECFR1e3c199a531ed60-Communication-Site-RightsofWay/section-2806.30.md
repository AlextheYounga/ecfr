##### § 2806.30 What are the rents for communication site rights-of-way? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 25964, Apr. 12, 2024.

(a) *Rent schedule.* (1) The BLM uses a rent schedule to calculate the rent for communication site rights-of-way. The schedule is based on nine population strata (the population served), as depicted in the most recent version of the Ranally Metro Area (RMA) Population Ranking, and the type of communication use or uses for which we normally grant communication site rights-of-way. These uses are listed as part of the definition of “communication use rent schedule,” set out at § 2801.5(b). You may obtain a copy of the current schedule from any BLM State, district, or field office or by writing: U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, 20 M Street SE., Room 2134LM, Washington, DC 20003. We also post the current communication use rent schedule at *http://www.blm.gov*.

(2) We update the schedule annually based on two sources: The U.S. Department of Labor Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, U.S. City Average (CPI-U), as of July of each year (difference in CPI-U from July of one year to July of the following year), and the RMA population rankings.

(3) BLM will limit the annual adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index to no more than 5 percent. At least every 10 years BLM will review the rent schedule to ensure that the schedule reflects fair market value.

(b) *Uses not covered by the schedule.* The communication use rent schedule does not apply to:

(1) Communication site uses, facilities, and devices located entirely within the exterior boundaries of an oil and gas lease, and directly supporting the operations of the oil and gas lease (see parts 3160 through 3190 of this chapter);

(2) Communication facilities and uses ancillary to and authorized under a linear grant, such as a railroad grant or an oil and gas pipeline grant;

(3) Communication uses not listed on the schedule, such as telephone lines, fiber optic cables, and new technologies;

(4) Grants for which BLM determines the rent by competitive bidding; or

(5) Communication facilities and uses for which the BLM State Director concurs that:

(i) The expected annual rent, as BLM estimates from market data, exceeds the rent from the rent schedule by five times; or

(ii) The communication site serves a population of one million or more and the expected annual rent for the communication use or uses is more than $10,000 above the rent from the rent schedule.
