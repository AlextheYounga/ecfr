##### ยง 2806.41 How will BLM calculate rent for communication facilities ancillary to a linear grant or other use authorization? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 25964, Apr. 12, 2024.

When a communication facility is ancillary to, and authorized by BLM under, a grant for a linear use, or some other type of use authorization (e.g., a mineral lease or sundry notice), BLM will determine the rent using the linear rent schedule (*see* ยง 2806.20 of this subpart) or rent scheme associated with the other authorization, and not the communication use rent schedule.
