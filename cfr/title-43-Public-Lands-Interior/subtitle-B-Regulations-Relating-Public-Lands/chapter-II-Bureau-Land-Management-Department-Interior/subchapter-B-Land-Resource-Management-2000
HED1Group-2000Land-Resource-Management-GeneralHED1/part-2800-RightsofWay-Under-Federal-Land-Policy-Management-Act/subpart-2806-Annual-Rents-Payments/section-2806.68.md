Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 35682, May 1, 2024.

(a) *Grant for energy site-specific testing.* You must pay $100 per year for each meteorological tower or instrumentation facility location. BLM offices with approved small site rental schedules may use those fee structures if the fees in those schedules charge more than $100 per meteorological tower per year. In lieu of annual payments, you may instead pay for the entire term of the grant (3 years or less).

(b) *Grant for energy project-area testing.* You must pay $2,000 per year or $2 per acre per year for the lands authorized by the grant, whichever is greater. There is no additional rent for the installation of each meteorological tower or instrumentation facility located within the site testing and monitoring project area.
