(a) You must amend your application or seek an amendment of your grant when there is a proposed substantial deviation in location or use.

(b) The requirements to amend an application or grant are the same as those for a new application, including paying cost recovery fees and rent according to §§ 2804.14, 2805.16, and 2806.10.

(c) Any activity not authorized by your grant may subject you to prosecution under applicable law and to trespass charges under subpart 2808 of this part.

(d) Grants issued prior to October 21, 1976:

(1) If there is a proposed substantial deviation in the location or use, or terms and conditions of your right-of-way grant, you must apply for a new grant consistent with the remainder of this section.

(2) If you wish to renew your grant, you must apply for a new grant.

(3) If the BLM has terminated your grant due to non-compliance with the terms and conditions of your grant, you must apply for a new grant.

The BLM may include the same terms and conditions in the new grant as were in the original grant as to annual rent, duration, and nature of interest if the BLM determines, based on current land use plans and other management decisions, that it is in the public interest to do so.

(e) You must apply for a new grant to allow realignment of your railroad and appurtenant communication facilities. BLM must issue a decision within 6 months after it receives your complete application. BLM may include the same terms and conditions in the new grant as were in the original grant as to annual rent, duration, and nature of interest if:

(1) These terms are in the public interest;

(2) The lands are of approximately equal value; and

(3) The lands involved are not within an incorporated community.
