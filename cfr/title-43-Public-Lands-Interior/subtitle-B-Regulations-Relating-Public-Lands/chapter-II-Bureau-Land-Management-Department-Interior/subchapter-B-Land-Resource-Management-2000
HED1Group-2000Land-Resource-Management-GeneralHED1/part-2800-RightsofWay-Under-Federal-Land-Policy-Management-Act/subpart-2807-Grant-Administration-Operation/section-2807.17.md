##### § 2807.17 Under what conditions may BLM suspend or terminate my grant? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 35682, May 1, 2024.

(a) BLM may suspend or terminate your grant if you do not comply with applicable laws and regulations or any terms, conditions, or stipulations of the grant (such as rent payments), or if you abandon the right-of-way.

(b) A grant also terminates when:

(1) The grant contains a term or condition that has been met that requires the grant to terminate;

(2) BLM consents in writing to your request to relinquish the grant;

(3) A court terminates it or requires the BLM to terminate it; or

(4) It is required by law to terminate.

(c) Your failure to use your right-of-way for its authorized purpose for any continuous 5-year period creates a presumption of abandonment. BLM will notify you in writing of this presumption. You may rebut the presumption of abandonment by proving that you used the right-of-way or that your failure to use the right-of-way was due to circumstances beyond your control, such as acts of God, war, or casualties not attributable to you.

(d) The BLM may suspend or terminate another Federal agency's grant only if:

(1) The terms and conditions of the Federal agency's grant allow it; or

(2) The agency head holding the grant consents to it.

(e) You may appeal a decision under this section under § 2801.10 of this part.
