##### § 2809.11 How will the BLM solicit nominations? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 35683, May 1, 2024.

(a) *Call for nominations.* The BLM will publish a notice in the Federal Register and may use other notification methods, such as a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the potential offer of public land for solar and wind energy development or the Internet; to solicit nominations and expressions of interest for parcels of land inside designated leasing areas for solar or wind energy development.

(b) *Nomination submission.* A nomination must be in writing and must include the following:

(1) *Nomination fee.* If you nominate a specific parcel of land under paragraph (a) of this section, you must also include a non-refundable nomination fee of $5 per acre. We will adjust the nomination fee once every 10 years using the change in the IPD-GDP for the preceding 10-year period and round it to the nearest half dollar. This 10 year average will be adjusted at the same time as the per acre rent schedule for linear rights-of-way under § 2806.22;

(2) *Nominator's name and personal or business address.* The name of only one citizen, association, partnership, corporation, or municipality may appear as the nominator. All communications relating to leasing will be sent to that name and address, which constitutes the nominator's name and address of record; and

(3) The legal land description and a map of the nominated lands.

(c) We may consider informal expressions of interest suggesting lands to be included in a competitive offer. If you submit a written expression of interest, you must provide a description of the suggested lands and rationale for their inclusion in a competitive offer.

(d) In order to submit a nomination, you must be qualified to hold a grant or lease under § 2803.10.

(e) *Nomination withdrawals.* A nomination cannot be withdrawn, except by the BLM for cause, in which case all nomination monies will be refunded to the nominator.
