##### § 2804.14 What is the processing fee for a grant application? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 25959, Apr. 12, 2024.

(a) Unless you are exempt under § 2804.16, you must pay a fee to the BLM for the reasonable costs of processing your application. Subject to applicable laws and regulations, if processing your application involves Federal agencies other than the BLM, your fee may also include the reasonable costs estimated to be incurred by those Federal agencies. Instead of paying the BLM a fee for the reasonable costs incurred by other Federal agencies in processing your application, you may pay other Federal agencies directly for such costs. Reasonable costs are those costs as defined in Section 304(b) of FLPMA (43 U.S.C. 1734(b)). The fees for Processing Categories 1 through 4 (see paragraph (b) of this section) are one-time fees and are not refundable. The fees are categorized based on an estimate of the amount of time that the Federal Government will expend to process your application and issue a decision granting or denying the application.

(b) There is no processing fee if the Federal Government's work is estimated to take 1 hour or less. Processing fees are based on categories. The BLM will update the processing fees for Categories 1 through 4 in the schedule each calendar year, based on the previous year's change in the IPD-GDP, as measured second quarter to second quarter, rounded to the nearest dollar. The BLM will update Category 5 processing fees as specified in the Master Agreement. These categories and the estimated range of Federal work hours for each category are:

(c) You may obtain a copy of the current year's processing fee schedule from any BLM State, district, or field office or by writing: U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, 20 M Street SE., Room 2134LM, Washington, DC 20003. The BLM also posts the current processing fee schedule at *http://www.blm.gov.*

(d) After an initial review of your application, BLM will notify you of the processing category into which your application fits. You must then submit the appropriate payment for that category before BLM begins processing your application. Your signature on a cost recovery Master Agreement constitutes your agreement with the processing category decision. If you disagree with the category that BLM has determined for your application, you may appeal the decision under § 2801.10 of this part. For Processing Categories 5 and 6 applications, *see* §§ 2804.17, 2804.18, and 2804.19 of this subpart. If you paid the processing fee and you appeal a Processing Category 1 through 4 or a Processing Category 6 determination, BLM will process your application while the appeal is pending. If IBLA finds in your favor, you will receive a refund or adjustment of your processing fee.

(e) In processing your application, BLM may determine at any time that the application requires preparing an EIS. If this occurs, BLM will send you a decision changing your processing category to Processing Category 6. You may appeal this decision under § 2801.10 of this part.

(f) To expedite processing of your application, you may notify BLM in writing that you are waiving paying reasonable costs and are electing to pay the full actual costs incurred by BLM in processing your application and monitoring your grant.
