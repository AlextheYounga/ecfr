##### ยง 2804.23 When will the BLM use a competitive process? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 35678, May 1, 2024.

(a) If there are two or more competing applications for the same facility or system and your application is in:

(1) *Processing Category 1 through 4.* You must reimburse the Federal Government for processing costs as if the other application or applications had not been filed.

(2) *Processing Category 6.* You are responsible for processing costs identified in your application. If BLM cannot readily separate costs, such as costs associated with preparing environmental analyses, you and any competing applicants must pay an equal share or a proportion agreed to in writing among all applicants and BLM. If you agree to share costs that are common to your application and that of a competing applicant, and the competitor does not pay the agreed upon amount, you are liable for the entire amount due. The applicants must pay the entire processing fee in advance. BLM will not process your application until we receive the advance payments.

(b) *Who determines whether competition exists?* BLM determines whether the applications are compatible in a single right-of-way system or are competing applications for the same system.

(c) If we determine that competition exists, we will describe the procedures for a competitive bid through a bid announcement in the Federal Register. We may also provide notice by other methods, such as a newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the potential right-of-way, or the Internet. We may offer lands through a competitive process on our own initiative. The BLM will not competitively offer lands for which the BLM has accepted an application and received a plan of development and cost recovery agreement.

(d) *Competitive process for solar and wind energy development outside designated leasing areas.* Lands outside designated leasing areas may be made available for solar and wind energy applications through a competitive application process established by the BLM under ยง 2804.30.

(e) *Competitive process for solar and wind energy development inside designated leasing areas.* Lands inside designated leasing areas may be offered competitively under subpart 2809.
