##### ยง 3179.11 Other waste prevention measures. #####

(a) If production from an oil well newly connected to a gas pipeline results or is expected to result in one or more producing wells already connected to the pipeline being forced off the pipeline, the BLM may exercise its authority under applicable laws and regulations, as well as its authority under the terms of applicable permits, orders, leases, and unitization or communitization agreements, to limit the production level from the new well until the pressure of gas production from the new well stabilizes at levels that allow transportation of gas from all wells connected to the pipeline.

(b) If gas capture capacity is not yet available on a given lease, the BLM may exercise its authority under applicable laws and regulations, as well as its authority under the terms of applicable permits, orders, leases, and unitization or communitization agreements, to delay action on an APD for that lease, or approve the APD with conditions for gas capture or limitations on production. If the lease for which an APD is submitted is not yet producing, the BLM may direct or grant a lease suspension under 43 CFR 3103.4-4.
