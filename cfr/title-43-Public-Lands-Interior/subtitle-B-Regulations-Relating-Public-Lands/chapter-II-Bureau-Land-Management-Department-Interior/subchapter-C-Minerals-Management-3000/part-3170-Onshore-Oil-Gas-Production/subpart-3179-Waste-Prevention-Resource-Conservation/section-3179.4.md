##### § 3179.4 Determining when the loss of oil or gas is avoidable or unavoidable. #####

For purposes of this subpart:

(a) *Unavoidably lost* oil or gas means lost oil or gas provided that the operator has not been negligent; the operator has complied fully with applicable laws, lease terms, regulations, provisions of a previously approved operating plan, or other written orders of the BLM; and the oil or gas is:

(1) Produced oil or gas that is lost from the following operations or sources, and that cannot be recovered in the normal course of operations, where the operator has taken prudent and reasonable steps to avoid waste:

(i) Well drilling;

(ii) Well completion and related operations;

(iii) Initial production tests, subject to the limitations in § 3179.103;

(iv) Subsequent well tests, subject to the limitations in § 3179.104;

(v) Exploratory coalbed methane well dewatering;

(vi) Emergencies, subject to the limitations in § 3179.105;

(vii) Normal operating losses from a natural gas-activated pneumatic controller or pump that is in compliance with § 3179.201 and § 3179.202;

(viii) Normal operating losses from a storage vessel or other low pressure production vessel that is in compliance with § 3179.203 and § 3174.5(b);

(ix) Well venting in the course of downhole well maintenance and/or liquids unloading performed in compliance with § 3179.204;

(x) Leaks, when the operator has complied with the leak detection and repair requirements in §§ 3179.301-305;

(xi) Facility and pipeline maintenance, such as when an operator must blow-down and depressurize equipment to perform maintenance or repairs; or

(xii) Flaring of gas from which at least 50 percent of natural gas liquids have been removed and captured for market, if the operator has notified the BLM through a Sundry Notice that the operator is conducting such capture; or

(2) Produced gas that is flared or vented from a well that is not connected to a gas pipeline, provided the BLM has not determined loss of gas through such venting or flaring is otherwise avoidable.

(b) *Avoidably lost oil* or gas means: Lost oil or gas that is not “unavoidably lost,” as defined in paragraph (a) of this section; waste oil that became waste oil through operator negligence; and, any “excess flared gas,” as defined in § 3179.7.
