##### § 3179.302 Approved instruments and methods. #####

(a) The operator must use one or more of the following instruments, operated according to the manufacturer's specifications or as specified below, to detect leaks:

(1) An optical gas imaging device capable of imaging a gas that is half methane, half propane at a concentration of 10,000 ppm at a flow rate of less than or equal to 60 grams per hour from a quarter inch diameter orifice;

(2) A portable analyzer device capable of detecting leaks, such as catalytic oxidation, flame ionization, infrared absorption or photoionization devices, used for a leak detection survey conducted in compliance with the relevant sections of Method 21 at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-7, including section 8.3.1. and assisted by audio, visual, and olfactory inspection; or

(3) A leak detection device not listed in this section that is approved by the BLM for use by any operator under § 3179.302(d) of this subpart.

(b) The person operating any of the leak detection devices listed in or approved under this section must be adequately trained in the proper use of the device.

(c) Any person may request approval of an alternative monitoring device and protocol by submitting a Sundry Notice to BLM that includes the following information:

(1) Specifications of the proposed monitoring device, including a detection limit capable of supporting the desired function;

(2) The proposed monitoring protocol using the proposed monitoring device, including how results will be recorded;

(3) Records and data from laboratory and field testing, including but not limited to performance testing;

(4) A demonstration that the proposed monitoring device and protocol will achieve equal or greater reduction of gas lost through leaks compared with the approach specified in § 3179.302(a)(1) when used according to § 3179.303(a) of this subpart;

(5) Tracking and documentation procedures; and

(6) Proposed limitations on the types of sites or other conditions on deploying the device and the protocol to achieve the demonstrated results.

(d) The BLM may approve an alternative monitoring device and associated inspection protocol, if the BLM finds that the alternative would achieve equal or greater reduction of gas lost through leaks compared with the approach specified in § 3179.302(a)(1) when used according to § 3179.303(a) of this subpart.

(1) The BLM will provide public notice of a submission for approval under section 3179.302(c).

(2) The BLM may approve an alternative device and monitoring protocol for use in all or most applications, or for use on a pilot or demonstration basis under specified circumstances that limit where and for how long the device may be used.

(3) The BLM will post on the BLM Web site a list of each approved alternative monitoring device and protocol, along with any limitations on its use.
