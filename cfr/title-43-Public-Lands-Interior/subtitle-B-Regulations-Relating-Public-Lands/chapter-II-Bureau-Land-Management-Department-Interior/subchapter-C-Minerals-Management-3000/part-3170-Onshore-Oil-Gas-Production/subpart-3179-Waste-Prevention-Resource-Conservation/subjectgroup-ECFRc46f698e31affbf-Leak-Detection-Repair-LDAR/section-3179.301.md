(1) A site and all equipment associated with it used to produce, process, compress, treat, store, or measure natural gas (including oil wells that also produce natural gas) from or allocated to a Federal or Indian lease, unit, or communitized area, where the site is upstream of or contains the approved point of royalty measurement; and

(2) A site and all equipment operated by the operator and associated with a site used to store, measure, or dispose of produced water, where the site is located on a Federal or Indian lease.

(b) The requirements of §§ 3179.301 through 3179.305 of this subpart do not apply to:

(1) A site that contains a wellhead or wellheads and no other equipment; or

(2) A well or well equipment that has been depressurized.

(c) As prescribed in §§ 3179.302 and 3179.303 of this subpart, the operator must inspect all equipment covered under this section, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, for gas leaks from leak components.

(d) The operator is not required to inspect or monitor a leak component that is not an accessible component.

(e) For purposes of §§ 3179.301 through 3179.305, the term “site” means a discrete area located on a lease, unit, or communitized area, and containing a wellhead, wellhead equipment, or other equipment used to produce, process, compress, treat, store, or measure natural gas or store, measure, or dispose of produced water, which is suitable for inspection in a single visit.

(1) Within one year of January 17, 2017 for sites that have begun production prior to January 17, 2017;

(2) Within 60 days of beginning production for sites that begin production after January 17, 2017; and
