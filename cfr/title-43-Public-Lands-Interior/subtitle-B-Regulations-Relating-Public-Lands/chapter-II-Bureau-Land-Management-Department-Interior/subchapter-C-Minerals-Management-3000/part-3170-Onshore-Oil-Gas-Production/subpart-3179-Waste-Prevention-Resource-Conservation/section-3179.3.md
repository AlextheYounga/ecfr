##### ยง 3179.3 Definitions and acronyms. #####

As used in this subpart, the term:

*Accessible component* means a component that can be reached, if necessary, by safe and proper use of portable ladders or by built-in ladders and walkways. Accessible components also include components that can be reached by the safe use of an extension on a monitoring probe.

*Automatic ignition system* means an automatic ignitor and, where needed to ensure continuous combustion, a continuous pilot flame.

*Capture* means the physical containment of natural gas for transportation to market or productive use of natural gas, and includes reinjection and royalty-free on-site uses pursuant to subpart 3178.

*Capture infrastructure* means any pipelines, facilities, or other equipment (including temporary or mobile equipment) used to capture, transport, or process gas. Capture infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, equipment that compresses or liquefies natural gas, removes natural gas liquids, or generates electricity from gas.

*Compressor station* means any permanent combination of one or more compressors that move natural gas at increased pressure through gathering or transmission pipelines, or into or out of storage. This includes, but is not limited to, gathering and boosting stations and transmission compressor stations. The combination of one or more compressors located at a well site, or located at an onshore natural gas processing plant, is not a compressor station.

*Continuous bleed* means a continuous flow of pneumatic supply natural gas to a pneumatic controller.

*Development oil well* or *development gas well* means a well drilled to produce oil or gas, respectively, from an established field in which commercial quantities of hydrocarbons have been discovered and are being produced. For purposes of this subpart, the BLM will determine when a well is a development oil well or development gas well in the event of a disagreement between the BLM and the operator.

*Gas-to-oil ratio (GOR)* means the ratio of gas to oil in the production stream expressed in standard cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil.

*Gas well* means a well for which the energy equivalent of the gas produced, including its entrained liquefiable hydrocarbons, exceeds the energy equivalent of the oil produced. Unless more specific British thermal unit (Btu) values are available, a well with a gas-to-oil ratio greater than 6,000 standard cubic feet (scf) of gas per barrel of oil is a gas well. Except where gas has been re-injected into the reservoir, a mature oil well would not be reclassified as a gas well even after normal production decline has caused the GOR to increase beyond 6,000 scf of gas per barrel of oil.

*High pressure flare* means an open-air flare stack or flare pit designed for the combustion of natural gas leaving a pressurized production vessel (such as a separator or heater-treater) that is not a storage vessel.

*Leak* means a release of natural gas from a component that is not associated with normal operation of the component, when such release is:

(1) A visible hydrocarbon emission detected by use of an optical gas imaging instrument;

(2) At least 500 ppm of hydrocarbon detected using a portable analyzer or other instrument that can measure the quantity of the release; or

(3) Visible bubbles detected using soap solution.

Releases due to normal operation of equipment intended to vent as part of normal operations, such as gas-driven pneumatic controllers and safety release devices, are not considered leaks unless the releases exceed the quantities and frequencies expected during normal operations. Releases due to operator errors or equipment malfunctions or from control equipment at levels that exceed applicable regulatory requirements, such as releases from a thief hatch left open, a leaking vapor recovery unit, or an improperly sized combustor, are considered leaks.

*Leak component* means any component that has the potential to leak gas and can be monitored in the manner described in sections 3179.301 through 3179.305 of this subpart, including, but not limited to, valves, connectors, pressure relief devices, open-ended lines, flanges, covers and closed vent systems, thief hatches or other openings on a storage vessel, compressors, instruments, and meters.

*Liquid hydrocarbon* means chemical compounds of hydrogen and carbon atoms that exist as a liquid under the temperature and pressure at which they are measured. The term is used to refer to oil, condensate, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), and natural gas liquids (NGL).

*Liquids unloading* means the removal of an accumulation of liquid hydrocarbons or water from the wellbore of a completed gas well.

*Lost oil or lost gas* means produced oil or gas that escapes containment, either intentionally or unintentionally, or is flared before being removed from the lease, unit, or communitized area, and cannot be recovered.

*Pneumatic controller* means an automated instrument used for maintaining a process condition such as liquid level, pressure, delta-pressure, or temperature.

*Storage vessel* means a tank or other vessel that contains an accumulation of crude oil, condensate, intermediate hydrocarbon liquids, or produced water, and that is constructed primarily of non-earthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic), which provide structural support. A well completion vessel that receives recovered liquids from a well after startup of production following flowback, for a period that exceeds 60 days, is considered a storage vessel under this subpart unless the storage of the recovered liquids in the vessel is governed by ยง 3162.3-3 of this title. For purposes of this subpart, the following are not considered storage vessels:

(1) Vessels that are skid-mounted or permanently attached to something that is mobile (such as trucks, railcars, barges or ships), and are intended to be located at a site for less than 180 consecutive days. This exclusion does not apply to well completion vessels or to storage vessels that are located at a site for at least 180 consecutive days.

(2) Process vessels such as surge control vessels, bottoms receivers, or knockout vessels.

(3) Pressure vessels designed to operate in excess of 204.9 kilopascals and without emissions to the atmosphere.

(4) Tanks holding hydraulic fracturing fluid prior to implementation of an approved permanent disposal plan under Onshore Oil and Gas Order No. 7.

*Volatile organic compounds (VOC)* has the same meaning as defined in 40 CFR 51.100(s).
