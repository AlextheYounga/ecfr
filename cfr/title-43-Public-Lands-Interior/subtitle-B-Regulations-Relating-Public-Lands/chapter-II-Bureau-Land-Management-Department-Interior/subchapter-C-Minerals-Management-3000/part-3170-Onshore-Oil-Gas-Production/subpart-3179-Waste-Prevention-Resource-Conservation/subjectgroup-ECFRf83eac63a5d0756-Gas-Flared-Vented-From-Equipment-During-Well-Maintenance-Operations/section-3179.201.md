##### § 3179.201 Equipment requirements for pneumatic controllers. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 58072, Dec. 8, 2017.

(a) A pneumatic controller that uses natural gas produced from a Federal or Indian lease, or from a unit or communitized area that includes a Federal or Indian lease, is subject to this section if the pneumatic controller:

(1) Has a continuous bleed rate greater than 6 standard cubic feet (scf) per hour; and

(2) Is not subject to any of the requirements of 40 CFR part 60, subpart OOOO or subpart OOOOa, but would be subject to one of those subparts if it were a new, modified, or reconstructed source.

(b) The operator must replace a pneumatic controller subject to this section with a controller (including but not limited to a continuous or intermittent pneumatic controller) having a bleed rate of 6 scf per hour or less within the timeframes set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, unless:

(1) Use of a pneumatic controller with a bleed rate greater than 6 scf per hour is required based on functional needs that may include, but are not limited to, response time, safety, and positive actuation, provided that the operator notifies the BLM through a Sundry Notice that describes the functional needs necessitating the use of a pneumatic controller with a bleed rate greater than 6 scf per hour;

(2) The pneumatic controller exhaust was, as of January 17, 2017 and continues to be, routed to a flare device or low-pressure combustor;

(3) The pneumatic controller exhaust is routed to processing equipment; or

(4) The operator notifies the BLM through a Sundry Notice and demonstrates, and the BLM agrees, based on the information identified in paragraph (c) of this section, that replacement of a pneumatic controller subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section would impose such costs as to cause the operator to cease production and abandon significant recoverable oil reserves under the lease.

(c) To support a demonstration under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the operator must submit a Sundry Notice that includes the following information:

(1) The name, number, and location of each of the operator's wells, and the number of the lease, unit, or communitized area with which it is associated;

(2) The oil and gas production levels of each of the operator's wells on the lease, unit or communitized area for the most recent production month for which information is available;

(3) Data that show the costs of compliance with paragraph (b) of this section on the lease;

(4) Projected costs of and the combined stream of revenues from both gas and oil production, including:

(i) The operator's projections of gas prices, gas production volumes, gas quality (*i.e.,* heating value and H2S content), revenues derived from gas production, and royalty payments on gas production over the next 15 years or the life of the operator's lease, unit, or communitized area, whichever is less; and

(ii) The operator's projections of oil prices, oil production volumes, costs, revenues, and royalty payments from the operator's oil and gas operations within the lease over the next 15 years or the life of the operator's lease, unit, or communitized area, whichever is less.

(d) The operator must replace the pneumatic controller(s) no later than 1 year after the effective date of this section as required under paragraph (b) of this section. If, however, the well or facility that the pneumatic controller serves has an estimated remaining productive life of 3 years or less from the effective date of this section, then the operator may notify the BLM through a Sundry Notice and replace the pneumatic controller no later than 3 years from the effective date of this section.

(e) The operator must ensure pneumatic controllers are functioning within manufacturers' specifications.
