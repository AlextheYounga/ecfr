##### § 3179.103 Initial production testing. #####

(a) Gas flared during a well's initial production test is royalty-free under §§ 3179.4(a)(1)(iii) and 3179.5(b) of this subpart until one of the following occurs:

(1) The operator determines that it has obtained adequate reservoir information for the well;

(2) 30 days have passed since the beginning of the production test, except as provided in paragraph (b) and paragraph (d) of this section;

(3) The operator has flared 20 million cubic feet (MMcf) of gas, when volumes flared under this section are combined with volumes flared under § 3179.102(a)(2), except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section; or

(4) Production begins.

(b) The BLM may extend the period specified in paragraph (a)(2) not to exceed an additional 60 days, based on testing delays caused by well or equipment problems or if there is a need for further testing to develop adequate reservoir information.

(c) The BLM may increase the limit specified in paragraph (a)(3) by up to an additional 30 million cubic feet of gas for exploratory wells in remote locations where additional testing is needed in advance of development of pipeline infrastructure.

(d) During the dewatering and initial evaluation of an exploratory coalbed methane well, the 30-day period specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is extended to 90 days. The BLM may approve up to two extensions of this evaluation period, of up to 90 days each.

(e) The operator must submit its request for a longer test period or increased limit under paragraphs (b), (c), or (d) of this section using a Sundry Notice.
