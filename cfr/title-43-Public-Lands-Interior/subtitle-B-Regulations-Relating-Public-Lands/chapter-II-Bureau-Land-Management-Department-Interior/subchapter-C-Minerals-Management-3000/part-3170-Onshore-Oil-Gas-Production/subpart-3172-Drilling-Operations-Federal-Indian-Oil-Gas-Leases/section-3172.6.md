##### § 3172.6 Well control. #####

(a) *Requirements.* Blowout preventer (BOP) and related equipment (BOPE) shall be installed, used, maintained, and tested in a manner necessary to assure well control and shall be in place and operational prior to drilling the surface casing shoe unless otherwise approved by the APD. Commencement of drilling without the approved BOPE installed, unless otherwise approved, shall subject the operator to immediate assessment under 43 CFR 3163.1(b)(1). The BOP and related control equipment shall be suitable for operations in those areas which are subject to sub-freezing conditions. The BOPE shall be based on known or anticipated sub-surface pressures, geologic conditions, accepted engineering practice, and surface environment. Item number 7 of the 8 point plan in the APD specifically addresses expected pressures. The working pressure of all BOPE shall exceed the anticipated surface pressure to which it may be subjected, assuming a partially evacuated hole with a pressure gradient of 0.22 psi/ft.

(b) *Violation classifications.* The gravity of the violation for many of the well control minimum standards listed in paragraphs (b)(1) through (9) of this section are shown as minor. However, very short abatement periods in this subpart are often specified in recognition that by continuing to drill, the violation which was originally determined to be of a minor nature may cause or threaten immediate, substantial, and adverse impact on public health and safety, the environment, production accountability, or royalty income, which would require it reclassification as a major violation.

(1) *Minimum standards and enforcement provisions for well control equipment.* (i) A well control device shall be installed at the surface that is capable of complete closure of the well bore. This device shall be closed whenever the well is unattended.
