##### § 3100.9 Information collection. #####

(a) *Authority:* 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520

(b)(1) *Purpose.* The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 generally provides that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person is not required to respond to a collection of information, unless the collection displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Control Number. This part displays OMB control numbers assigned to information collection requirements contained in the BLM's regulations at 43 CFR part 3100. This section aids in fulfilling the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act to display current OMB Control Numbers for these information collection requirements. Interested persons should consult *https://www.reginfo.gov* for the most current information on these OMB control numbers; including among other things, the justification for the information collection requirements, description of likely respondents, estimated burdens, and current expiration dates.
