##### ยง 3107.1 Extension by drilling. #####

Any lease on which actual drilling operations were commenced prior to the end of its primary term and are being diligently prosecuted at the end of the primary term or any lease which is part of an approved communitization agreement or cooperative or unit plan of development or operation upon which such drilling takes place, shall be extended for 2 years subject to the rental being timely paid as required by ยง 3103.2 of this title, and subject to the provisions of ยง 3105.2-3 and ยง 3186.1 of this title, if applicable. Actual drilling operations shall be conducted in a manner that anyone seriously looking for oil or gas could be expected to make in that particular area, given the existing knowledge of geologic and other pertinent facts. In drilling a new well on a lease or for the benefit of a lease under the terms of an approved agreement or plan, it shall be taken to a depth sufficient to penetrate at least 1 formation recognized in the area as potentially productive of oil or gas, or where an existing well is reentered, it shall be taken to a depth sufficient to penetrate at least 1 new and deeper formation recognized in the area as potentially productive of oil or gas. The authorized officer may determine that further drilling is unwarranted or impracticable.
