A separate report of operations for each lease shall be made on Form 3160-6 for each calendar month, beginning with the month in which drilling operations are initiated, and shall be filed with the authorized officer on or before the 10th day of the second month following the operation month, unless an extension of time for the filing of such report is granted by the authorized officer. The report on this form shall disclose accurately all operations conducted on each well during each month, the status of operations on the last day of the month, and a general summary of the status of operations on the leased lands, and the report shall be submitted each month until the lease is terminated or until omission of the report is authorized by the authorized officer. It is particularly necessary that the report shall show for each calendar month:
