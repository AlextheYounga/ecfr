##### § 3162.3-1 Drilling applications and plans. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 58072, Dec. 8, 2017.

(a) Each well shall be drilled in conformity with an acceptable well-spacing program at a surveyed well location approved or prescribed by the authorized officer after appropriate environmental and technical reviews (see § 3162.5-1 of this title). An acceptable well-spacing program may be either (1) one which conforms with a spacing order or field rule issued by a State Commission or Board and accepted by the authorized officer, or (2) one which is located on a lease committed to a communitized or unitized tract at a location approved by the authorized officer, or (3) any other program established by the authorized officer.

(b) Any well drilled on restricted Indian land shall be subject to the location restrictions specified in the lease and/or Title 25 of the CFR.

(c) The operator shall submit to the authorized officer for approval an Application for Permit to Drill for each well. No drilling operations, nor surface disturbance preliminary thereto, may be commenced prior to the authorized officer's approval of the permit.

(d) The Application for Permit to Drill process shall be initiated at least 30 days before commencement of operations is desired. Prior to approval, the application shall be administratively and technically complete. A complete application consists of Form 3160-3 and the following attachments:

(1) A drilling plan, which may already be on file, containing information required by paragraph (e) of this section and appropriate orders and notices.

(2) A surface use plan of operations containing information required by paragraph (f) of this section and appropriate orders and notices.

(3) Evidence of bond coverage as required by the Department of the Interior regulations, and

(4) Such other information as may be required by applicable orders and notices.

(e) Each drilling plan shall contain the information specified in applicable notices or orders, including a description of the drilling program, the surface and projected completion zone location, pertinent geologic data, expected hazards, and proposed mitigation measures to address such hazards. A drilling plan may be submitted for a single well or for several wells proposed to be drilled to the same zone within a field or area of geological and environmental similarity. A drilling plan may be modified from time to time as circumstances may warrant, with the approval of the authorized officer.

(f) The surface use plan of operations shall contain information specified in applicable orders or notices, including the road and drillpad location, details of pad construction, methods for containment and disposal of waste material, plans for reclamation of the surface, and other pertinent data as the authorized officer may require. A surface use plan of operations may be submitted for a single well or for several wells proposed to be drilled in an area of environmental similarity.

(g) For Federal lands, upon receipt of the Application for Permit to Drill or Notice of Staking, the authorized officer shall post the following information for public inspection at least 30 days before action to approve the Application for Permit to Drill: the company/operator name; the well name/number; the well location described to the nearest quarter-quarter section (40 acres), or similar land description in the case of lands described by metes and bounds, or maps showing the affected lands and the location of all tracts to be leased and of all leases already issued in the general area; and any substantial modifications to the lease terms. Where the inclusion of maps in such posting is not practicable, maps of the affected lands shall be made available to the public for review. This information also shall be provided promptly by the authorized officer to the appropriate office of the Federal surface management agency, for lands the surface of which is not under Bureau jurisdiction, requesting such agency to post the proposed action for public inspection for at least 30 days. The posting shall be in the office of the authorized officer and in the appropriate surface managing agency if other than the Bureau. The posting of an Application for Permit to Drill is for information purposes only and is not an appealable decision.

(h) Upon initiation of the Application for Permit to Drill process, the authorized officer shall consult with the appropriate Federal surface management agency and with other interested parties as appropriate and shall take one of the following actions as soon as practical, but in no event later than 5 working days after the conclusion of the 30-day notice period for Federal lands, or within 30 days from receipt of the application for Indian lands:

(1) Approve the application as submitted or with appropriate modifications or conditions;

(2) Return the application and advise the applicant of the reasons for disapproval; or

(3) Advise the applicant, either in writing or orally with subsequent written confirmation, of the reasons why final action will be delayed along with the date such final action can be expected.

The surface use plan of operations for National Forest System lands shall be approved by the Secretary of Agriculture or his/her representative prior to approval of the Application for Permit to Drill by the authorized officer. Appeals from the denial of approval of such surface use plan of operations shall be submitted to the Secretary of Agriculture.

(i) Approval of the Application for Permit to Drill does not warrant or certify that the applicant holds legal or equitable title to the subject lease(s) which would entitle the applicant to conduct drilling operations.

(j) When submitting an Application for Permit to Drill an oil well, the operator must also submit a plan to minimize waste of natural gas from that well. The waste minimization plan must accompany, but would not be part of, the Application for Permit to Drill. The waste minimization plan must set forth a strategy for how the operator will comply with the requirements of 43 CFR subpart 3179 regarding control of waste from venting and flaring, and must explain how the operator plans to capture associated gas upon the start of oil production, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible, including an explanation of why any delay in capture of the associated gas would be required. Failure to submit a complete and adequate waste minimization plan is grounds for denying or disapproving an Application for Permit to Drill. The waste minimization plan must include the following information:

(1) The anticipated completion date of the proposed well(s);

(2) A description of anticipated production, including:

(i) The anticipated date of first production;

(ii) The expected oil and gas production rates and duration from the proposed well. If the proposed well is on a multi-well pad, the plan should include the total expected production for all wells being completed;

(iii) The expected production decline curve of both oil and gas from the proposed well; and

(iv) The expected Btu value for gas production from the proposed well.

(3) Certification that the operator has provided one or more midstream processing companies with information about the operator's production plans, including the anticipated completion dates and gas production rates of the proposed well or wells;

(4) Identification of a gas pipeline to which the operator plans to connect, with sufficient capacity to accommodate the anticipated production of the proposed well(s), and information on the pipeline, including, to the extent that the operator can obtain it, the following information:

(i) Maximum current daily capacity of the pipeline;

(ii) Current throughput of the pipeline;

(iii) Anticipated daily capacity of the pipeline at the anticipated date of first gas sales from the proposed well;

(iv) Anticipated throughput of the pipeline at the anticipated date of first gas sales from the proposed well; and

(v) Any plans known to the operator for expansion of pipeline capacity for the area that includes the proposed well; and

(5) If an operator cannot identify a gas pipeline with sufficient capacity to accommodate the anticipated production of the proposed well(s), the waste minimization plan must also include:

(i) A gas pipeline system location map of sufficient detail, size, and scale as to show the field in which the proposed well will be located, and all existing gas trunklines within 20 miles of the well. The map should also contain:

(A) The name and location of the gas processing plant(s) closest to the proposed well(s), and of the intended destination processing plant, if different;

(B) The location and name of the operator of each gas trunkline within 20 miles of the proposed well;

(C) The proposed route and tie-in point that connects or could connect the subject well to an existing gas trunkline;

(ii) The total volume of produced gas, and percentage of total produced gas, that the operator is currently flaring or venting from wells in the same field and any wells within a 20-mile radius of that field; and

(iii) A detailed evaluation, including estimates of costs and returns, of opportunities for on-site capture approaches, such as compression or liquefaction of natural gas, removal of natural gas liquids, or generation of electricity from gas.
