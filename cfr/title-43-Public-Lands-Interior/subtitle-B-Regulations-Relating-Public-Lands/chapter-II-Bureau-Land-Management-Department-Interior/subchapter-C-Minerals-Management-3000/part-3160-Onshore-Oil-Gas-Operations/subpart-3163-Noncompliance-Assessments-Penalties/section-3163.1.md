Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 81609, November 17, 2016.

(a) Whenever an operating rights owner or operator fails or refuses to comply with the regulations in this part, the terms of any lease or permit, or the requirements of any notice or order, the authorized officer shall notify the operating rights owner or operator, as appropriate, in writing of the violation or default. Such notice shall also set forth a reasonable abatement period:

(1) If the violation or default is not corrected within the time allowed, the authorized officer may subject the operating rights owner or operator, as appropriate, to an assessment of not more than $500 per day for each day nonabatement continues where the violation or default is deemed a major violation;

(2) Where noncompliance involves a minor violation, the authorized officer may subject the operating rights owner or operator, as appropriate, to an assessment of $250 for failure to abate the violation or correct the default within the time allowed;

(3) When necessary for compliance, or where operations have been commenced without approval, or where continued operations could result in immediate, substantial, and adverse impacts on public health and safety, the environment, production accountability, or royalty income, the authorized officer may shut down operations. Immediate shut-in action may be taken where operations are initiated and conducted without prior approval, or where continued operations could result in immediate, substantial, and adverse impacts on public health and safety, the environment, production accountability, or royalty income. Shut-in actions for other situations may be taken only after due notice, in writing, has been given;

(4) When necessary for compliance, the authorized officer may enter upon a lease and perform, or have performed, at the sole risk and expense of the operator, operations that the operator fails to perform when directed in writing by the authorized officer. Appropriate charges shall include the actual cost of performance, plus an additional 25 percent of such amount to compensate the United States for administrative costs. The operator shall be provided with a reasonable period of time either to take corrective action or to show why the lease should not be entered;

(5) Continued noncompliance may subject the lease to cancellation and forfeiture under the bond. The operator shall be provided with a reasonable period of time either to take corrective action or to show why the lease should not be recommended for cancellation;

(6) Where actual loss or damage has occurred as a result of the operator's noncompliance, the actual amount of such loss or damage shall be charged to the operator.

(b) Certain instances of noncompliance are violations of such a serious nature as to warrant the imposition of immediate assessments upon discovery. Upon discovery the following violations shall result in immediate assessments, which may be retroactive, in the following specified amounts per violation:

(1) For failure to install blowout preventer or other equivalent well control equipment, as required by the approved drilling plan, $500 per day for each day that the violation existed, including days the violation existed prior to discovery, not to exceed $5,000;

(2) For drilling without approval or for causing surface disturbance on Federal or Indian surface preliminary to drilling without approval, $500 per day for each day that the violation existed, including days the violation existed prior to discovery, not to exceed $5,000;

(3) For failure to obtain approval of a plan for well abandonment prior to commencement of such operations, $500.

(c) Assessments under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall not exceed $1,000 per day, per operating rights owner or operator, per lease. Assessments under paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall not exceed a total of $500 per operating rights owner or operator, per lease, per inspection.

(d) Continued noncompliance shall subject the operating rights owner or operator, as appropriate, to penalties described in ยง 3163.2 of this title.

(e) On a case-by-case basis, the State Director may compromise or reduce assessments under this section. In compromising or reducing the amount of the assessment, the State Director shall state in the record the reasons for such determination.
