##### § 3712.2-2 Evidence necessary to support a request for publication. #####

(a) The second and third paragraphs of section 5(a) of the Act provide in detail for the filing by the head of a Federal department or agency of certain evidence in support of the request for publication of the notice referred to in § 3712.2-1 as follows:

The filing of such request for publication shall be accompanied by an affidavit or affidavits of a person or persons over twenty-one years of age setting forth that the affiant or affiants have examined the lands involved in a reasonable effort to ascertain whether any person or persons were in actual possession of or engaged in the working of such lands or any part thereof, and, if no person or persons were found to be in actual possession of or engaged in the working of said lands or any part thereof, on the date of such examination, setting forth such fact, or, if any person or persons were so found to be in actual possession or engaged in such working on the date of such examination, setting forth the name and address of each such person, unless affiant shall have been unable through reasonable inquiry to obtain information as to the name and address of any such person, in which event the affidavit shall set forth fully the nature and results of such inquiry.

The filing of such request for publication shall also be accompanied by the certificate of a title or abstract company, or of a title abstractor, or of an attorney, based upon such company's abstractor's or attorney's examination of those instruments which are shown by the tract indexes in the county office of record as affecting the lands described in said request, setting forth the name of any person disclosed by said instruments to have an interest in said lands under any unpatented mining claim heretofore located, together with the address of such person if such address is disclosed by such instruments of record. “Tract indexes” as used herein shall mean those indexes, if any, as to surveyed lands identifying instruments as affecting a particular legal subdivision of the public land surveys, and as to unsurveyed lands identifying instruments as affecting a particular probable legal subdivision according to a projected extension of the public land surveys.

(b) This part of the Act requires the filing of an affidavit which may be made by any person or persons over twenty-one years of age who have examined the lands. It must show whether any person or persons were “in actual possession of or engaged in the working of such lands (the lands described in the request for publication of notice) or any part thereof” and, if they were, the name and address of each such person must be given if it can be learned by reasonable inquiry and if it cannot be so learned, the affidavit must show in detail what inquiry or inquiries were made to obtain each such name and address. No definition of the terms “in actual possession” or “engaged in the working of said lands” will be attempted here, but the affidavits should recite what evidences of occupancy or workings were found. The request for publication must also be accompanied by a certificate executed as provided in the third paragraph of section 5(a) and containing the information required by that paragraph to be furnished. If there are no tract indexes, as defined in the Act, in the county office of record affecting the lands described in the request for publication, a certificate executed as provided in the said third paragraph of section 5(a) to that effect must be furnished.
