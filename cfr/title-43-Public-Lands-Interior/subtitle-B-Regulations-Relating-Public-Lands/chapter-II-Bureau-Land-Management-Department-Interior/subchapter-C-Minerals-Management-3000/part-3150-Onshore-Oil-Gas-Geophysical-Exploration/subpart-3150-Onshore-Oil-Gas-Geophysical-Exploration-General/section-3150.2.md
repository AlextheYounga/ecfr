##### ยง 3150.2 Appeals. #####

(a) A party adversely affected by a decision or approval of the authorized officer may appeal that decision to the Interior Board of Land Appeals as set forth in part 4 of this title.

(b) All decisions and approvals of the authorized officer under this part shall remain effective pending appeal unless the Interior Board of Land Appeals determines otherwise upon consideration of the standards stated in this paragraph. The provisions of 43 CFR 4.21(a) shall not apply to any decision or approval of the authorized officer under this part. A petition for a stay of a decision or approval of the authorized officer shall be filed with the Interior Board of Land Appeals, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of the Interior, and shall show sufficient justification based on the following standards:

(1) The relative harm to the parties if the stay is granted or denied,

(2) The likelihood of the appellant's success on the merits,

(3) The likelihood of irreparable harm to the appellant or resources if the stay is not granted, and

(4) Whether the public interest favors granting the stay.

Nothing in this paragraph shall diminish the discretionary authority of the authorized officer to stay the effectiveness of a decision subject to appeal pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section upon a request by an adversely affected party or on the authorized officer's own initiative. If the authorized officer denies such a request, the requester can petition for a stay of the denial decision by filing a petition with the Interior Board of Land Appeals that addresses the standards described above in this paragraph.[57 FR 9012, Mar. 13, 1992, as amended at 57 FR 44336, Sept. 25, 1992]
