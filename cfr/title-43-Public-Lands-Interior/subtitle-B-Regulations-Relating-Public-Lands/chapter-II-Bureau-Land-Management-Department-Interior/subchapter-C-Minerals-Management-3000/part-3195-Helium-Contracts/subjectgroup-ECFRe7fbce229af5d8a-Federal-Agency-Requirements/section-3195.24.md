##### ยง 3195.24 What must I do before contacting a non-Federal helium supplier for my helium needs? #####

You must make an initial determination about the annual helium demand for each helium use location for the expected life of the purchase order/contract. If the annual helium demand for a helium use location is a major helium requirement, it must be supplied by a Federal helium supplier.
