##### § 3746.1 Mining locations for fissionable source materials. #####

(a) In view of the amendment of section 5(b)(7) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 by section 10(c) of the Act of August 13, 1954 (68 Stat. 708), and of the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 921), it is clear that after enactment of said Act of August 13, 1954, valid mining locations under the mining laws of the United States may be based upon a discovery of a mineral deposit which is a fissionable source material.

(b) As to mining locations made prior to the enactment of said Act of August 13, 1954, section 10(d) of the act provides:

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, and particularly sec. 5(b)(7) thereof, prior to its amendment hereby, or the provisions of the Act of August 12, 1953 (67 Stat. 539), and particularly sec. 3 thereof, any mining claim, heretofore located under the mining laws of the United States for or based upon a discovery of a mineral deposit which is a fissionable source material and which, except for the possible contrary construction of said Atomic Energy Act, would have been locatable under such mining laws, shall, insofar as adversely affected by such possible contrary construction, be valid and effective, in all respects to the same extent as if said mineral deposit were a locatable mineral deposit other than a fissionable source material.
