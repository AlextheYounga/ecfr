##### § 51.15 Designation procedures. #####

(a) The OES may request a Bureau/Office to prepare a designation request for certain guidance documents. Designation requests must include the following information:

(1) A summary description of the guidance document; and

(2) The Bureau/Office recommended designation of “not significant,” “significant,” or “economically significant,” as well as a justification for that designation.

(b) OES must seek significance determinations from OIRA for guidance documents in the same manner as for regulatory actions. Prior to publishing such guidance documents, and with sufficient time to allow OIRA to review the document in the event that a significance determination is made, OES will provide OIRA with an opportunity to review the designation request or the guidance document, if requested, to determine if it meets the definition of “significant” under Executive Order 13891.
