##### § 2.3 Where should you send a FOIA request? #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 61826, Nov. 14, 2019.

(a) The Department does not have a central location for submitting FOIA requests and it does not maintain a central index or database of records in its possession. Instead, the Department's records are decentralized and maintained by various bureaus and offices throughout the country.

(b) To make a request for Department records, you must write directly to the bureau that you believe maintains those records.

(c) Address requests to the appropriate FOIA contact in the bureau that maintains the requested records. The Department's FOIA Web site, *https://www.doi.gov/foia*, lists the physical and email addresses of each bureau's FOIA Officer, along with other appropriate FOIA contacts at *http://www.doi.gov/foia/contacts.*

(d) Questions about where to send a FOIA request should be directed to the bureau that manages the underlying program or to the appropriate FOIA Public Liaison, as discussed in § 2.66 of this part.
