Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 61828, Nov. 14, 2019.

(a) To rely on Exemption 4 as basis for nondisclosure, the submitter must explain why the information is confidential information. To do this, the submitter must give the bureau a detailed written statement. This statement must include a specific and detailed discussion of why the information is a trade secret or, if the information is not a trade secret, the following three categories must be addressed (unless the bureau informs the submitter that a response to one of the first two categories will not be necessary):

(1) Whether the submitter provided the information voluntarily and, if so, how disclosure will impair the Government's ability to obtain similar information in the future and/or how the information fits into a category of information that the submitter does not customarily release to the public;

(2) Whether the Government required the information to be submitted, and if so, how disclosure will impair the Government's ability to obtain similar information in the future and/or how substantial competitive or other business harm would likely result from disclosure; and

(3) A certification that the information is confidential, has not been disclosed to the public by the submitter, and is not routinely available to the public from other sources.

(b) If not already provided, the submitter must include a daytime telephone number, an email and mailing address, and a fax number (if available).
