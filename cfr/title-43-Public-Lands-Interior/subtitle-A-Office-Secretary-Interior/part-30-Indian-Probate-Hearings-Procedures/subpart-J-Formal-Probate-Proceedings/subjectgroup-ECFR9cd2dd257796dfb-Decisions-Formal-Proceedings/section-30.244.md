##### ยง 30.244 How will the judge decide my petition for reopening? #####

(a) If the judge finds that proper grounds are not shown, the judge will issue an order denying the petition for reopening and giving the reasons for the denial. An order denying reopening must include a notice stating that interested parties who are adversely affected have a right to appeal the order to the Board within 30 days of the date on which the order was mailed, and giving the Board's address. Copies of the judge's decision must be mailed to the petitioner, the agencies, and those persons whose rights would be affected.

(b) If the petition appears to show merit, the judge must cause copies of the petition and all papers filed by the petitioner to be served on those persons whose interest in the estate might be affected if the petition is granted. They may respond to the petition by filing answers, cross-petitions, or briefs. The filings must be made within the time periods set by the judge.
