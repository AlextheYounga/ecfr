No. Successive petitions for rehearing are not permitted. The jurisdiction of the judge terminates when he or she issues a decision finally disposing of a petition for rehearing, except for:

(a) The issuance of necessary orders nunc pro tunc to correct clerical errors in the decision; and

(b) The reopening of a case under this part.
