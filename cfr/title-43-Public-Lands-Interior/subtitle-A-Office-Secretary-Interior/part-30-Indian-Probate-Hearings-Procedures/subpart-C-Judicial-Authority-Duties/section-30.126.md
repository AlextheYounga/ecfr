(b) When the property to be included takes a different line of descent from that shown in the original decision, the judge will:

(1) Conduct a hearing, if necessary, and issue a decision; and

(2) File a record of the proceeding with the designated LTRO.

(c) The judge's modification order or decision will become final at the end of the 30 days after the date on which it was mailed, unless a timely notice of appeal is filed with the Board within that period.

(d) Any interested party who is adversely affected by the judge's modification order or decision may appeal it to the Board within 30 days after the date on which it was mailed.

(e) The judge's modification order or decision must include a notice stating that interested parties who are adversely affected have a right to appeal the decision to the Board within 30 days after the decision is mailed, and giving the Board's address. The judge's modification order or decision will become final at the end of this 30-day period, unless a timely notice of appeal is filed with the Board.
