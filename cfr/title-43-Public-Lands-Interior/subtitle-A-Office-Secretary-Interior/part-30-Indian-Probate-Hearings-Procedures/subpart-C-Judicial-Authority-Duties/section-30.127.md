##### § 30.127 What happens if property was improperly included in the inventory? #####

(a) When, after a decision and order in a formal probate proceeding, it is found that property has been improperly included in the inventory of an estate, the inventory must be modified to eliminate this property. A petition for modification may be filed by the superintendent of the agency where the property is located, or by any interested party. The petitioner must serve the petition on all parties whose interests may be affected by the requested modification.

(b) A judge will review the merits of the petition and the record of the title from the LTRO on which the modification is to be based, enter an appropriate decision, and give notice of the decision as follows:

(1) If the decision is entered without a formal hearing, the judge must give notice of the decision to all interested parties whose rights are affected.

(2) If a formal hearing is held, the judge must:

(i) Enter a final decision based on his or her findings, modifying or refusing to modify the property inventory; and

(ii) Give notice of the decision to all interested parties whose rights are affected.

(c) Where appropriate, the judge may conduct a formal hearing at any stage of the modification proceeding. The hearing must be scheduled and conducted under this part.

(d) The judge's decision must include a notice stating that interested parties who are adversely affected have a right to appeal the decision to the Board within 30 days after the date on which the decision was mailed, and giving the Board's address. The judge's decision will become final at the end of this 30-day period, unless a timely notice of appeal is filed with the Board.

(e) The judge must forward the record of all proceedings under this section to the designated LTRO.
