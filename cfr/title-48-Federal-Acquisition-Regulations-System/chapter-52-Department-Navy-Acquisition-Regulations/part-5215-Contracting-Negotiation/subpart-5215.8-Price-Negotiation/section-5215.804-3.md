##### 5215.804-3 Exemptions from or waiver of submission of certified cost or pricing data. #####

(a) *General.* As explained in 5215.402, cost or pricing data would not normally be obtained because the predominant portion of Navy procurements are awarded on the basis of adequate price competition.

(b)(1)(iii) Adequate price competition may also exist where price is a secondary factor in the evaluation of proposals, as long as price is a substantial factor. Price, as used herein, means cost plus any fee or profit applicable to the contract price. Thus, in competitive acquisitions where adequate price competition is contemplated, the contracting officer shall not require the submission of cost or pricing data whether certified or not, as defined in FAR 15.801, regardless of the type of contract.

(b)(3) Examples of contract awards for which prices may be based on adequate price competition and/or to have been established by adequate price competition are:

(i) Contracts for items for which there are a limited number of sources and the prices at which award will be made are within a reasonable amount of each other and compare favorably with independent Government estimates and with prior prices paid;

(ii) Any contract, including cost-type contracts, when cost is a significant evaluation factor; and

(iii) Contracts for which there are dual sources.
