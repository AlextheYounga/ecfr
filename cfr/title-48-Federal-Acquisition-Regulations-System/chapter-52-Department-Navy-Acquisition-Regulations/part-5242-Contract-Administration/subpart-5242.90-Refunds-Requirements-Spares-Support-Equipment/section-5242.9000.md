##### 5242.9000 Requests for refunds. #####

(a) *Policy.* (1) This subpart establishes uniform policy and procedures on requesting refunds for spare parts or items of support equipment. This policy is not intended to diminish the responsibility of Navy contracting personnel to properly price spare parts and items of support equipment. Further, it is not intended to serve as a mechanism for the recovery of excess profits.

(2) In accordance with the guidance set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, contracting activities shall request a refund whenever the contract price of any spare part or item of support equipment significantly exceeds the item's intrinsic value as defined in the clause at 5252.242-9000. Refunds shall be requested only for the difference between the intrinsic value of the item at the time an agreement on price was reached and the contract price. Refunds will not be requested to recoup the amount of cost decreases that occur over time due to productivity gains (beyond economic quantity considerations) or changes in market conditions.

(b) *Examples.* The following are examples of circumstances which may establish a basis for a refund request or pricing adjustment:

(1) A technical or engineering analysis results in a determination that the intrinsic value is significantly lower than the historical price.

(2) The price paid for an item bought competitively in similar quantity and circumstances (e.g., urgency, delivery terms) is significantly less than the former sole source price.

(3) Prices paid to the manufacturer of an item indicate the amount previously charged by the prime contractor for the item significantly exceeded the intrinsic value of the prime contractor's efforts in providing the item.

(c) *Solicitation provisions.* The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 5252.242-9000 in solicitations, Basic Ordering Agreements, and contracts (as defined in FAR 2.101) which contain or may contain requirements for spare parts or items of support equipment, except those contracts awarded as a result of competitive small purchase procedures and orders under federal supply schedules. If added to existing contracts, the clause will not apply to items or components ordered by the Government prior to the date of incorporation of the clause into the contract. Heads of Contracting Activities (HCAs) are delegated, without power of redelegation, authority to establish monetary thresholds below which refunds will not be requested.
