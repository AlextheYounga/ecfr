Key Personnel (DEC 2000)

(a) The personnel listed below or elsewhere in this contract [Insert cross-reference, if applicable] are considered essential to the work being performed under this contract. Before removing, replacing, or diverting any of the listed or specified personnel, the Contractor must: (1) Notify the Contracting Officer reasonably in advance; (2) submit justification (including proposed substitutions) in sufficient detail to permit evaluation of the impact on this contract; and (3) obtain the Contracting Officer's written approval.
