As prescribed in 970.3270(a)(6), insert the following clause:

Strategic Partnership Project Funding Authorization (April 23, 2015)

Any uncollectible receivables resulting from the Contractor utilizing contractor corporate funding for reimbursable work shall be the responsibility of the Contractor, and the United States Government shall have no liability to the Contractor for the Contractor's uncollected receivables. The Contractor is permitted to provide advance payment utilizing contractor corporate funds for reimbursable work to be performed by the Contractor for a non-Federal entity in instances where advance payment from that entity is required under the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract and such advance cannot be obtained. The Contractor is also permitted to provide advance payment utilizing contractor corporate funds to continue reimbursable work to be performed by the Contractor for a Federal entity when the term or the funds on a Federal interagency agreement required under the Laws, regulations, and DOE directives clause of this contract have elapsed. The Contractor's utilization of contractor corporate funds does not relieve the Contractor of its responsibility to comply with all requirements for Strategic Partnership Projects applicable to this contract.
