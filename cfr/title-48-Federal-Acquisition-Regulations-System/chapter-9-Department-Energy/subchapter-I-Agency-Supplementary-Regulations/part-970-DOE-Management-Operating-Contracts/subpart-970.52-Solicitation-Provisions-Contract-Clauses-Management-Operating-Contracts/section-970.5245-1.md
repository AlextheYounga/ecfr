The Contractor may, upon such terms and conditions as the Contracting Officer may approve, sell, or exchange such property, or acquire such property at a price agreed upon by the Contracting Officer and the Contractor as the fair value thereof. The amount received by the Contractor as the result of any disposition, or the agreed fair value of any such property acquired by the Contractor, shall be applied in reduction of costs allowable under this contract or shall be otherwise credited to account to the Government, as the Contracting Officer may direct. Upon completion of the work or the termination of this contract, the Contractor shall render an accounting, as prescribed by the Contracting Officer, of all government property which had come into the possession or custody of the Contractor under this contract.

(e) *Protection of government property—management of high-risk property and classified materials.* (1) The Contractor shall take all reasonable precautions, and such other actions as may be directed by the Contracting Officer, or in the absence of such direction, in accordance with sound business practice, to safeguard and protect government property in the Contractor's possession or custody.

(2) In addition, the Contractor shall ensure that adequate safeguards are in place, and adhered to, for the handling, control and disposition of high-risk property and classified materials throughout the life cycle of the property and materials consistent with the policies, practices and procedures for property management contained in the Federal Property Management Regulations (41 CFR chapter 101), the Department of Energy (DOE) Property Management Regulations (41 CFR chapter 109), and other applicable Regulations.

(ii) If, after an initial review of the facts, the Contracting Officer informs the Contractor that there is reason to believe that the loss, destruction of, or damage to the government property results from conduct falling within one of the categories set forth above, the burden of proof shall be upon the Contractor to show that the Contractor should not be required to compensate the government for the loss, destruction, or damage.

(2) In the event that the Contractor is determined liable for the loss, destruction or damage to Government property in accordance with (f)(1) of this clause, the Contractor's compensation to the Government shall be determined as follows:

(i) For damaged property, the compensation shall be the cost of repairing such damaged property, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement of the damaged property. However, the value of repair costs shall not exceed the fair market value of the damaged property. If a fair market value of the property does not exist, the Contracting Officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts and circumstances.

(ii) For destroyed or lost property, the compensation shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of such loss or destruction, plus any costs incurred for temporary replacement and costs associated with the disposition of destroyed property. If a fair market value of the property does not exist, the Contracting Officer shall determine the value of such property, consistent with all relevant facts and circumstances.
