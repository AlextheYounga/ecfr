(a) The DOT does not have a centralized location to receive unsolicited proposals. The type of effort submitted in the proposal determines which DOT OA should receive and evaluate the proposal.

(b) Unsolicited proposals should be submitted to the responsible OA contracting office for appropriate handling. Specific information concerning the mission of each DOT OA is available on the worldwide web at *http://www.dot.gov.* Prospective contractors are urged to contact these contracting/procurement offices prior to submitting a proposal to ensure that the unsolicited proposal reaches the correct contracting office for action. This action will reduce unnecessary paperwork and wasted time for both the Government and the prospective contractors.
