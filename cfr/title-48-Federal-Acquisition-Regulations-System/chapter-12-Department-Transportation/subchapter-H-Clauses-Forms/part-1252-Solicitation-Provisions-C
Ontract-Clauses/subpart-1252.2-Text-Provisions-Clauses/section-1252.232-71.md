As prescribed in 1232.770-7, insert the following clause:

Limitation of Government's Obligation (NOV 2022)

(a) Funding is not currently available to fully fund this contract due to the Government operating under a continuing resolution (CR). The item(s) listed in the table below are being incrementally funded as described below. The funding allotted to these item(s) is presently available for payment and allotted to this contract. This table will be updated by a modification to the contract when additional funds, if any, are made available to this contract.

|Contract line item No. (CLIN)|CLIN total price|Funds allotted  <br/>to the CLIN|Funds required  <br/>for complete  <br/>funding of  <br/>the CLIN|
|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
|                             |       $        |               $                |                                $                                |
|                             |       $        |               $                |                                $                                |
|                             |       $        |               $                |                                $                                |
|                             |       $        |               $                |                                $                                |
|           Totals            |       $        |               $                |                                $                                |

(b) For the incrementally funded CLIN(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause, the Contractor agrees to perform up to the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any invoice payments to which the Contractor is entitled and reimbursement of authorized termination costs in the event of termination of those CLIN(s) for the Government's convenience, does not exceed the total amount currently obligated to those CLIN(s). The Contractor is not authorized to continue work on these item(s) beyond that point. The Government will not be obligated—in any event—to reimburse the Contractor in excess of the amount allotted to the CLIN(s) of the contract regardless of anything to the contrary in any other clause, including but not limited to the clause entitled “Termination for Convenience of the Government” or paragraph (l) entitled “Termination for the Government's Convenience” of the clause at FAR 52.212-4,“Commercial Terms and Conditions—Commercial Products and Commercial Services.”

(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (h) of this clause, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing at least 30 days prior to the date when, in the Contractor's best judgment, the work will reach the point at which the total amount payable by the Government, including any cost for termination for convenience, will approximate 85 percent of the total amount then allotted to the contract for performance of the item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause. The notification shall state the estimated date when that point will be reached and an estimate of additional funding, if any, needed to continue performance. The notification shall also advise the Contracting Officer of the estimated amount of additional funds required for the timely performance of the item(s) funded pursuant to this contract. If after such notification additional funds are not allotted by the date identified in the Contractor's notification, or by an agreed upon substitute date, the Contracting Officer will terminate any item(s) for which additional funds have not been allotted, pursuant to the terms of this contract authorizing termination for the convenience of the Government. Failure to make the notification required by this paragraph, whether for reasons within or beyond the Contractor's control, will not increase the maximum amount payable to the Contractor under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this clause.

(d) The Government may, at any time prior to termination, allot additional funds for the performance of the item(s) identified in paragraph (a) of this clause.

(e) The termination provisions of paragraphs (a) through (h) of this clause do not limit the rights of the Government under the clause entitled “Default” or paragraph (m) entitled “Termination for Cause,” of the clause at FAR 52.212-4, “Commercial Terms and Conditions—Commercial Products and Commercial Services.” The provisions of this clause are limited to the work and allotment of funds for the item(s) set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause. This clause no longer applies once the contract is fully funded.

(f) Nothing in this clause affects the right of the Government to terminate this contract pursuant to the Government's termination for convenience terms set forth in this contract.

(g) Nothing in this clause shall be construed as authorization of voluntary services whose acceptance is otherwise prohibited under 31 U.S.C. 1342.

(h) The parties contemplate that the Government will allot funds to this contract from time to time as the need arises and as funds become available. There is no fixed schedule for providing additional funds.
