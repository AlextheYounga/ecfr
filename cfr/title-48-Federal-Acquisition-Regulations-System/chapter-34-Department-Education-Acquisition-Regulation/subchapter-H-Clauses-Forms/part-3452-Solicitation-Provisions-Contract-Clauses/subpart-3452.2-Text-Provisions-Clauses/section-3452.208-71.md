Printing (MAR 2011)

Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall not engage in, nor subcontract for, any printing (as that term is defined in Title I of the Government Printing and Binding Regulations in effect on the effective date of this contract) in connection with the performance of work under this contract; except that performance involving the duplication of fewer than 5,000 units of any one page, or fewer than 25,000 units in the aggregate of multiple pages, shall not be deemed to be printing.

Examples of counting the number of units: black plus one additional color on one side of one page counts as two units. Three colors (including black) on two sides of one page count as six units.
