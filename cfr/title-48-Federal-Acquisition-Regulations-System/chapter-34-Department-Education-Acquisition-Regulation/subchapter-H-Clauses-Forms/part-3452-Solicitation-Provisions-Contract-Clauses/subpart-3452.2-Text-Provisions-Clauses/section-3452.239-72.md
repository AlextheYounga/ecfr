(5) Ensure that all contractor employees occupying high-risk designated positions submit forms for reinvestigation every five years for the duration of the contract or if there is a break in service to a Department contract of 365 days or more.

(6) Report to the COR all instances of individuals seeking to obtain unauthorized access to any departmental IT system, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information.

(7) Report to the COR any information that raises an issue as to whether a contractor employee's eligibility for continued employment or access to Department IT systems, or sensitive but unclassified and/or Privacy Act protected information, promotes the efficiency of the service or violates the public trust.

(8) Withdraw from consideration under the contract any employee receiving an unfavorable adjudication determination.

(9) Officially notify each contractor employee if he or she will no longer work on a Department contract.

(10) Abide by the requirements in Departmental Directive OM:5-101, “Contractor Employee Personnel Security Screenings.”

(f) Failure to comply with the contractor personnel security requirements may result in a termination of the contract for default.
