##### 3401.303 Publication and codification. #####

(a) The EDAR is issued as chapter 34 of title 48 of the CFR.

(1) The FAR numbering illustrations at FAR 1.105-2 apply to the EDAR.

(2) The EDAR numbering system corresponds with the FAR numbering system. An EDAR citation will include the prefix “34” prior to its corresponding FAR part citation; *e.g.,* FAR 25.108-2 would have corresponding EDAR text numbered as EDAR 3425.108-2.

(3) Supplementary material for which there is no counterpart in the FAR will be codified with a suffix beginning with “70” or, in cases of successive sections and subsections, will be numbered in the 70 series (*i.e.,* 71-79). These supplementing sections and subsections will appear to the closest corresponding FAR citation; *e.g.,* FAR 16.4 (Incentive Contracts) may be augmented in the EDAR by citing EDAR 3416.470 (Award Term) and FAR 16.403 (Fixed-price incentive contracts) may be augmented in the EDAR by citing EDAR 3416.403-70 (Award fee contracts). (*Note:* These citations are for illustrative purposes only and may not actually appear in the published EDAR). For example:

|     FAR      |Is implemented as|  Is augmented as   |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|
|      15      |      3415       |      3415.70       |
|     15.1     |     3415.1      |      3415.170      |
|    15.101    |    3415.101     |    3415.101-70     |
|   15.101-1   |   3415.101-1    |   3415.101-1-70    |
| 15.101-1(b)  |  3415.101-1(b)  | 3415.101-1(b)(70)  |
|15.101-1(b)(1)|3415.101-1(b)(1) |3415.101-1(b)(1)(70)|
