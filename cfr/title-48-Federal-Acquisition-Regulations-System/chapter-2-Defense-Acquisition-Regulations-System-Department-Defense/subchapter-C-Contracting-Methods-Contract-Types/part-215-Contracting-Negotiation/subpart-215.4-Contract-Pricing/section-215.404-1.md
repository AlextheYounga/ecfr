##### 215.404-1 Proposal analysis techniques. #####

(1) Follow the procedures at PGI 215.404-1 for proposal analysis.

(2) For spare parts or support equipment, perform an analysis of -

(i) Those line items where the proposed price exceeds by 25 percent or more the lowest price the Government has paid within the most recent 12-month period based on reasonably available data;

(ii) Those line items where a comparison of the item description and the proposal price indicates a potential for overpricing;

(iii) Significant high-dollar-value items. If there are no obvious high-dollar-value items, include an analysis of a random sample of items; and

(iv) A random sample of the remaining low-dollar value items. Sample size may be determined by subjective judgment, e.g., experience with the offeror and the reliability of its estimating and accounting systems.
