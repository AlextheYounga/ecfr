##### 225.401-70 End products subject to trade agreements. #####

Acquisitions of end products in the following product service groups (PSGs) are covered by trade agreements if the value of the acquisition is at or above the applicable trade agreement threshold and no exception applies. If an end product is not in one of the listed groups, the trade agreements do not apply. The definition of Caribbean Basin country end products in FAR 25.003 excludes those end products that are not eligible for duty-free treatment under 19 U.S.C. 2703(b). Therefore certain watches, watch parts, and luggage from certain Caribbean Basin countries are not eligible products. However, 225.003 expands the definition of Caribbean Basin country end products to include petroleum and any product derived from petroleum, in accordance with Section 8094 of Pub. L. 103-139.
