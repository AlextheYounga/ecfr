Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 76994, Dec. 16, 2022.

(a) In accordance with Section 8041 of the Fiscal Year 1991 DoD Appropriations Act (Public Law 101-511) and similar sections in subsequent DoD appropriations acts, do not acquire welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain, four inches or less in diameter, unless -

(1) It is manufactured in the United States, including cutting, heat treating, quality control, testing, and welding (both forging and shot blasting process); and

(2) The cost of the components manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the total cost of components.

(b) 10 U.S.C. 2534 also restricts acquisition of welded shipboard anchor and mooring chain, four inches or less in diameter, when used as a component of a naval vessel. However, the Appropriations Act restriction described in paragraph (a) of this subsection takes precedence over the restriction of 10 U.S.C. 2534.
