##### 252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure. #####

As prescribed in 204.7109(b), insert the following provision:

Alternative Line-Item Structure (SEP 2011)

(a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.

(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71. A sample solicitation line-item structure and a corresponding offer of a proposed alternative line-item structure follow.

Solicitation:

|Item No.|                   Supplies/Service                    |Quantity|Unit|Unit price|Amount|
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|----|----------|------|
|  0001  |Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse|   20   | EA |          |      |

Alternative line-item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:

|Item No.|               Supplies/Service               |Quantity|Unit|Unit Price|Amount|
|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------|----|----------|------|
|  0001  |Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse|   20   | EA |          |      |
