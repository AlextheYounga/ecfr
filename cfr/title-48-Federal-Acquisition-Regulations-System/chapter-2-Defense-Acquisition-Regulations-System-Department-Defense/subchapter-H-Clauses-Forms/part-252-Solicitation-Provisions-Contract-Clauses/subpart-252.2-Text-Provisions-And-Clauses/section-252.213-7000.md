The SPRS application provides the contracting officer quantifiable past performance information regarding a supplier's quality and delivery performance for the FSC and PSC of the supplies being purchased.

(c) The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in SPRS will be used by the contracting officer to evaluate a supplier's past performance in conjunction with the supplier's references (if requested) and other provisions of this solicitation under the past performance evaluation factor. The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quotation or offer represents the best value to the Government.
