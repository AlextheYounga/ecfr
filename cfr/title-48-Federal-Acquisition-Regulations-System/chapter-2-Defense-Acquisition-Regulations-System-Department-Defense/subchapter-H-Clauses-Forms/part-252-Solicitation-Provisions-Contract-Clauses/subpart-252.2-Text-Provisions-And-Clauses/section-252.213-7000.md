As prescribed in 213.106-2-70, use the following provision:

Notice to Prospective Suppliers on Use of Past Peformance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting in Past Performance Evaluations (JUNE 2015)

(a) The Past Performance Information Retrieval System - Statistical Reporting (PPIRS-SR) application (*http://www.ppirs.gov/*) will be used in the evaluation of suppliers' past performance in accordance with DFARS 213.106-2(b)(i).

(b) PPIRS-SR collects quality and delivery data on previously awarded contracts and orders from existing Department of Defense reporting systems to classify each supplier's performance history by Federal supply class (FSC) and product or service code (PSC). The PPIRS-SR application provides the contracting officer quantifiable past performance information regarding a supplier's quality and delivery performance for the FSC and PSC of the supplies being purchased.

(c) The quality and delivery classifications identified for a supplier in PPIRS-SR will be used by the contracting officer to evaluate a supplier's past performance in conjunction with the supplier's references (if requested) and other provisions of this solicitation under the past performance evaluation factor. The Government reserves the right to award to the supplier whose quotation or offer represents the best value to the Government.

(d) PPIRS-SR classifications are generated monthly for each contractor and can be reviewed by following the access instructions in the PPIRS-SR User's Manual found at *https://www.ppirs.gov/pdf/PPIRS-SR\_UserMan.pdf*. Contractors are granted access to PPIRS-SR for their own classifications only. Suppliers are encouraged to review their own classifications, the PPIRS-SR reporting procedures and classification methodology detailed in the PPIRS-SR User's Manual, and PPIRS-SR Evaluation Criteria available from the references at *https://www.ppirs.gov/pdf/PPIRS-SR\_DataEvaluationCriteria.pdf*. The method to challenge a rating generated by PPIRS-SR is provided in the User's Manual.
