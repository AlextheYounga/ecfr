Intent To Furnish Precious Metals as Government-Furnished Material (DEC 1991)

(a) The Government intends to furnish precious metals required in the manufacture of items to be delivered under the contract if the Contracting Officer determines it to be in the Government's best interest. The use of Government-furnished silver is mandatory when the quantity required is one hundred troy ounces or more. The precious metal(s) will be furnished pursuant to the Government Furnished Property clause of the contract.

(b) The Offeror shall cite the type (silver, gold, platinum, palladium, iridium, rhodium, and ruthenium) and quantity in whole troy ounces of precious metals required in the performance of this contract (including precious metals required for any first article or production sample), and shall specify the national stock number (NSN) and nomenclature, if known, of the deliverable item requiring precious metals.

(c) Offerors shall submit two prices for each deliverable item which contains precious metalsâ€”one based on the Government furnishing precious metals, and one based on the Contractor furnishing precious metals. Award will be made on the basis which is in the best interest of the Government.

(d) The Contractor agrees to insert this clause, including this paragraph (d), in solicitations for subcontracts and purchase orders issued in performance of this contract, unless the Contractor knows that the item being purchased contains no precious metals.
