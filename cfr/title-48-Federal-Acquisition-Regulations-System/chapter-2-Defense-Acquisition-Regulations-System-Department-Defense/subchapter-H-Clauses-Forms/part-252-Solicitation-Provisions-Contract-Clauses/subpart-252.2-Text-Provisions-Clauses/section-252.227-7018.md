(8) *Developed* means -

(i) (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.) An item, component, or process, exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code;

(ii) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;

(iii) Computer software, other than computer programs, has been tested or analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose; or

(iv) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to comply with requirements under that contract.

(9) *Developed exclusively at private expense* means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.

(i) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.

(ii) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.

(10) *Developed exclusively with government funds* means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.

(11) *Developed with mixed funding* means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.

(12) *Form, fit, and function data* means technical data that describe the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.

(13) *Generated* means technical data or computer software first created in the performance of this contract.

(14) *Government purpose* means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations.

(4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertions, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures of the Validation of Asserted Restrictions - Computer Software and/or Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data clauses of this contract.

(f) *Marking requirements.* The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data or software subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(6) of this clause, only the following markings are authorized under this contract: the limited rights legend at paragraph (f)(2) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (f)(3) of this clause, the SBIR data rights legend at paragraph (f)(4) of this clause, or the special license rights legend at paragraphs (f)(5) of this clause; and/or a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.

(1) *General marking instructions.* The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data or computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

(2) *Limited rights markings.* Technical data not generated under this contract that pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense and delivered or otherwise furnished with limited rights shall be marked with the following legend:

(ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (b)(6) of this clause).

(6) *Pre-existing data markings.* If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the prior contract or license. The marking procedures in paragraph (f)(1) of this clause shall be followed.

(g) *Contractor procedures and records.* Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data or computer software with other than unlimited rights, shall -

(1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and

(2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data or computer software delivered under this contract.

(h) *Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings* - (1) *Unjustified markings.* The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data or computer software furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data and the Validation of Asserted Restrictions - Computer Software clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.

(2) *Nonconforming markings.* A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data or the Validation of Asserted Restrictions - Computer Software clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within sixty (6)) days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.

(i) *Relation to patents.* Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.

(j) *Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer software.* (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract when -

(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data or software; or

(ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.

(2) The limitation in paragraph (j)(1) of this clause -

(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and

(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or computer software will be delivered.

(k) *Applicability to subcontractors or suppliers.* (1) the Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 2320, 10 U.S.C. 2321, and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (e) of this clause are recognized and protected.

(2) Whenever any noncommercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use this same clause in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties. The Contractor shall use the Technical Data - Commercial Items clause of this contract to obtain technical data pertaining to commercial items, components, or processes. No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.

(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.

(4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.

(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.

(End of clause)

*Alternate I* (JUN 1995). As prescribed in 227.7104(d), add the following paragraph (l) to the basic clause:

(l) *Publication for sale.* (1) This paragraph applies only to technical data or computer software delivered to the Government with SBIR data rights.

(2) Upon expiration of the SBIR data rights period, the Government will not exercise its right to publish or authorize others to publish an item of technical data or computer software identified in this contract as being subject to paragraph (l) of this clause if the Contractor, prior to the expiration of the SBIR data rights period, or within two years following delivery of the data or software item, or within twenty-four months following the removal of any national security or export control restrictions, whichever is later, publishes such data or software item(s) and promptly notifies the Contracting Officer of such publication(s). Any such publication(s) shall include a notice identifying the number of this contract and the Government's rights in the published data.

(3) This limitation on the Government's right to publish for sale shall continue as long as the technical data or computer software are reasonably available to the public for purchase.
