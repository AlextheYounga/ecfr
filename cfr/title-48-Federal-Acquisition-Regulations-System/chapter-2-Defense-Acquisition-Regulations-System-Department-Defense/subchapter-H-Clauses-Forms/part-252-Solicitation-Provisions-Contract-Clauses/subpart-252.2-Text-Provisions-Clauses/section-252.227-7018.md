Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technlogy Transfer Program (JAN 2025)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*Commercial computer software* means software developed or regularly used for nongovernmental purposes which—

(1) Has been sold, leased, or licensed to the public;

(2) Has been offered for sale, lease, or license to the public;

(3) Has not been offered, sold, leased, or licensed to the public but will be available for commercial sale, lease, or license in time to satisfy the delivery requirements of this contract; or

(4) Satisfies a criterion expressed in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this definition and would require only minor modification to meet the requirements of this contract.

*Computer database* means a collection of recorded data in a form capable of being processed by a computer. The term does not include computer software.

*Computer program* means a set of instructions, rules, or routines, recorded in a form that is capable of causing a computer to perform a specific operation or series of operations.

*Computer software* means computer programs, source code, source code listings, object code listings, design details, algorithms, processes, flow charts, formulae, and related material that would enable the software to be reproduced, re-created, or recompiled. Computer software does not include computer databases or computer software documentation.

*Computer software documentation* means owner's manuals, user's manuals, installation instructions, operating instructions, and other similar items, regardless of storage medium, that explain the capabilities of the computer software or provide instructions for using the software.

*Covered Government support contractor* means a contractor (other than a litigation support contractor covered by 252.204-7014) under a contract, the primary purpose of which is to furnish independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of a program or effort (rather than to directly furnish an end item or service to accomplish a program or effort), provided that the contractor—

(1) Is not affiliated with the prime contractor or a first-tier subcontractor on the program or effort, or with any direct competitor of such prime contractor or any such first-tier subcontractor in furnishing end items or services of the type developed or produced on the program or effort; and

(2) Receives access to the technical data or computer software for performance of a Government contract that contains the clause at 252.227-7025, Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends.

*Detailed manufacturing or process data* means technical data that describe the steps, sequences, and conditions of manufacturing, processing or assembly used by the manufacturer to produce an item or component or to perform a process.

*Developed* means—

(1) (Applicable to technical data other than computer software documentation.) An item, component, or process, exists and is workable. Thus, the item or component must have been constructed or the process practiced. Workability is generally established when the item, component, or process has been analyzed or tested sufficiently to demonstrate to reasonable people skilled in the applicable art that there is a high probability that it will operate as intended. Whether, how much, and what type of analysis or testing is required to establish workability depends on the nature of the item, component, or process, and the state of the art. To be considered “developed,” the item, component, or process need not be at the stage where it could be offered for sale or sold on the commercial market, nor must the item, component or process be actually reduced to practice within the meaning of Title 35 of the United States Code;

(2) A computer program has been successfully operated in a computer and tested to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the program can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose;

(3) Computer software, other than computer programs, has been tested or analyzed to the extent sufficient to demonstrate to reasonable persons skilled in the art that the software can reasonably be expected to perform its intended purpose; or

(4) Computer software documentation required to be delivered under a contract has been written, in any medium, in sufficient detail to comply with requirements under that contract.

*Developed exclusively at private expense* means development was accomplished entirely with costs charged to indirect cost pools, costs not allocated to a government contract, or any combination thereof.

(1) Private expense determinations should be made at the lowest practicable level.

(2) Under fixed-price contracts, when total costs are greater than the firm-fixed-price or ceiling price of the contract, the additional development costs necessary to complete development shall not be considered when determining whether development was at government, private, or mixed expense.

*Developed exclusively with government funds* means development was not accomplished exclusively or partially at private expense.

*Developed with mixed funding* means development was accomplished partially with costs charged to indirect cost pools and/or costs not allocated to a government contract, and partially with costs charged directly to a government contract.

*Form, fit, and function data* means technical data that describe the required overall physical, functional, and performance characteristics (along with the qualification requirements, if applicable) of an item, component, or process to the extent necessary to permit identification of physically and functionally interchangeable items.

*Generated* means, with respect to technical data or computer software, first created in the performance of this contract.

*Government purpose* means any activity in which the United States Government is a party, including cooperative agreements with international or multi-national defense organizations or sales or transfers by the United States Government to foreign governments or international organizations. Government purposes include competitive procurement, but do not include the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software for commercial purposes or authorize others to do so.

*Government purpose rights* means the rights to—

(1) Use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software within the Government without restriction; and

(2) Release or disclose technical data or computer software outside the Government and authorize persons to whom release or disclosure has been made to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose that data for United States Government purposes.

*Limited rights* means the rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data, in whole or in part, within the Government. The Government may not, without the written permission of the party asserting limited rights, release or disclose the technical data outside the Government, use the technical data for manufacture, or authorize the technical data to be used by another party, except that the Government may reproduce, release, or disclose such data or authorize the use or reproduction of the data by persons outside the Government if—

(1) The reproduction, release, disclosure, or use is—

(i) Necessary for emergency repair and overhaul; or

(ii) A release or disclosure to—

(A) A covered Government support contractor in performance of its covered Government support contracts for use, modification, reproduction, performance, display, or release or disclosure to a person authorized to receive limited rights technical data; or

(B) A foreign government, of technical data other than detailed manufacturing or process data, when use of such data by the foreign government is in the interest of the Government and is required for evaluational or informational purposes;

(2) The recipient of the technical data is subject to a prohibition on the further reproduction, release, disclosure, or use of the technical data; and

(3) The contractor or subcontractor asserting the restriction is notified of such reproduction, release, disclosure, or use.

*Minor modification* means a modification that does not significantly alter the nongovernmental function or purpose of computer software or is of the type customarily provided in the commercial marketplace.

*Other than commercial computer software* means software that does not qualify as commercial computer software under the definition of “commercial computer software” of this clause.

(4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertions, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures in the DFARS 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, and/or DFARS 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, clauses of this contract.

(g) *Marking requirements.* The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract by marking the deliverable data or software subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(8) of this clause, only the following markings are authorized under this contract: the government purpose rights marking at paragraph (g)(3) of this clause; the limited rights legend at paragraph (g)(4) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (g)(5) of this clause; the SBIR/STTR data rights legend at paragraph (g)(6) of this clause; or the special license rights legend at paragraph (g)(7) of this clause; and a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.

(1) *General marking instructions.* The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend to all technical data and computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmittal document or storage container and, for printed material, each page of the printed material containing technical data or computer software for which restrictions are asserted. When only portions of a page of printed material are subject to the asserted restrictions, such portions shall be identified by circling, underscoring, with a note, or other appropriate identifier. Technical data or computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of technical data, computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

(2) *Omitted markings.* (i) Technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under this contract without restrictive markings shall be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights. To the extent practicable, if the Contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this clause) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, the Contracting Officer will not release or disclose the technical data, software, or documentation pending evaluation of the request.

(ii) The Contractor may request permission to have conforming and justified restrictive markings placed on unmarked technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation at its expense. The request must be received by the Contracting Officer within 6 months following the furnishing or delivery of such technical data, software, or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall—

(A) Identify the technical data, software, or documentation that should have been marked;

(B) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of technical data, computer software, or computer software documentation contained in this clause; and

(C) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the technical data, software, or documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.

(3) *Government purpose rights markings.* Technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:

The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data or computer software are restricted by paragraph (c)(2) of the DFARS 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, clause contained in the above identified contract. No restrictions apply after the expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical data or computer software or portions thereof marked with this restrictive marking must also reproduce the markings.

(End of legend)

(4) *Limited rights markings.* Technical data not generated under this contract that pertain to items, components, or processes developed exclusively at private expense and delivered or otherwise furnished with limited rights shall be marked as follows:

Limited RightsContract NumberContractor NameContractor Address

The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose these technical data are restricted by paragraph (c)(3) of the DFARS 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of technical data or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such data must promptly notify the above named Contractor.

(End of legend)

(5) *Restricted rights markings.* Computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with restricted rights shall be marked as follows:

Restricted RightsContract NumberContractor NameContractor Address

The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this software are restricted by paragraph (c)(4) of the DFARS 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, clause contained in the above identified contract. Any reproduction of computer software or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings. Any person, other than the Government, who has been provided access to such software must promptly notify the above named Contractor.

(End of legend)

(6) *SBIR/STTR data rights markings.* Except for technical data or computer software in which the Government has acquired unlimited rights under paragraph (c)(1) of this clause or negotiated special license rights as provided in paragraph (c)(6) of this clause, technical data or computer software generated under this contract shall be marked as follows. The Contractor shall enter the expiration date for the SBIR/STTR data protection period on the legend:

SBIR/STTR Data RightsContract NumberContractor NameContractor AddressExpiration of SBIR/STTR Data Protection PeriodExpiration of the Government Purpose Rights Period

The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software marked with this legend are restricted during the period shown as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of the DFARS 252.227-7018, Rights in Other Than Commercial Technical Data and Computer Software—Small Business Innovation Research Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, clause contained in the above identified contract. After the SBIR/STTR data protection period expiration date shown above, the Government has perpetual government purpose rights as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of that clause, unless otherwise indicated by the government purpose rights expiration date shown above. Any reproduction of technical data, computer software, or portions thereof marked with this legend must also reproduce the markings.

(End of legend)

(7) *Special license rights markings.* (i) Technical data or computer software in which the Government's rights stem from a specifically negotiated license shall be marked as follows:

Special License Rights

The Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose this technical data or computer software are restricted by Contract Number *[Insert contract number],* License Number *[Insert license identifier].* Any reproduction of technical data, computer software, or portions thereof marked with this marking must also reproduce the markings.

(End of legend)

(ii) For purposes of this clause, special licenses do not include government purpose license rights acquired under a prior contract (see paragraph (c)(7) of this clause).

(8) *Preexisting data markings.* If the terms of a prior contract or license permitted the Contractor to restrict the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose technical data or computer software, and those restrictions are still applicable, the Contractor may mark such data or software with the appropriate restrictive legend for which the data or software qualified under the prior contract or license. The Contractor shall follow the marking procedures in paragraph (g)(1) of this clause.

(h) *Contractor procedures and records.* Throughout performance of this contract, the Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers that will deliver technical data or computer software with other than unlimited rights, shall—

(1) Have, maintain, and follow written procedures sufficient to assure that restrictive markings are used only when authorized by the terms of this clause; and

(2) Maintain records sufficient to justify the validity of any restrictive markings on technical data or computer software delivered under this contract.

(i) *Removal of unjustified and nonconforming markings.* (1) *Unjustified markings.* The rights and obligations of the parties regarding the validation of restrictive markings on technical data or computer software furnished or to be furnished under this contract are contained in the DFARS 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, and the DFARS 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, clauses of this contract, respectively. Notwithstanding any provision of this contract concerning inspection and acceptance, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, correct or strike a marking if, in accordance with the applicable procedures of those clauses, a restrictive marking is determined to be unjustified.

(2) *Nonconforming markings.* A nonconforming marking is a marking placed on technical data or computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government under this contract that is not in the format authorized by this contract. Correction of nonconforming markings is not subject to the DFARS 252.227-7037, Validation of Restrictive Markings on Technical Data, or the DFARS 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, clause of this contract. If the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor of a nonconforming marking or markings and the Contractor fails to remove or correct such markings within 60 days, the Government may ignore or, at the Contractor's expense, remove or correct any nonconforming markings.

(j) *Relation to patents.* Nothing contained in this clause shall imply a license to the Government under any patent or be construed as affecting the scope of any license or other right otherwise granted to the Government under any patent.

(k) *Limitation on charges for rights in technical data or computer software.* (1) The Contractor shall not charge to this contract any cost, including but not limited to, license fees, royalties, or similar charges, for rights in technical data or computer software to be delivered under this contract when—

(i) The Government has acquired, by any means, the same or greater rights in the data or software; or

(ii) The data are available to the public without restrictions.

(2) The limitation in paragraph (k)(1) of this clause—

(i) Includes costs charged by a subcontractor or supplier, at any tier, or costs incurred by the Contractor to acquire rights in subcontractor of supplier technical data or computer software, if the subcontractor or supplier has been paid for such rights under any other Government contract or under a license conveying the rights to the Government; and

(ii) Does not include the reasonable costs of reproducing, handling, or mailing the documents or other media in which the technical data or computer software will be delivered.

(l) *Subcontractors or suppliers.* (1) The Contractor shall assure that the rights afforded its subcontractors and suppliers under 10 U.S.C. 3771-3775, 10 U.S.C. 3781-3786, 15 U.S.C. 638(j)(1)(B)(iii) and (v), and the identification, assertion, and delivery processes required by paragraph (f) of this clause are recognized and protected.

(2) Whenever any other than commercial technical data or computer software is to be obtained from a subcontractor or supplier for delivery to the Government under this contract, the Contractor shall use the following clause(s) in the subcontract or other contractual instrument, and require its subcontractors or suppliers to do so, without alteration, except to identify the parties:

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (l)(2)(ii) of this clause, use this clause to govern SBIR/STTR data.

(ii) For data that are not SBIR/STTR data—

(A) Use the clause at DFARS 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Other Than Commercial Products and Commercial Services, to govern the technical data pertaining to other than commercial products or commercial services or to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed in any part at Government expense, and use the clause at DFARS 252.227-7015, Technical Data—Commercial Products and Commercial Services, to govern the technical data pertaining to any portion of a commercial product or commercial service that was developed exclusively at private expense;

(B) Use the DFARS clause at 252.227-7014, Rights in Other Than Commercial Computer Software and Other Than Commercial Computer Software Documentation, to govern other than commercial computer software and computer software documentation; and

(C) Use the license under which the data are customarily provided to the public, in accordance with DFARS 227.7202, for commercial computer software and commercial computer software documentation.

(iii) No other clause shall be used to enlarge or diminish the Government's, the Contractor's, or a higher tier subcontractor's or supplier's rights in a subcontractor's or supplier's technical data or computer software.

(3) Technical data required to be delivered by a subcontractor or supplier shall normally be delivered to the next higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier. However, when there is a requirement in the prime contract for technical data which may be submitted with other than unlimited rights by a subcontractor or supplier, then said subcontractor or supplier may fulfill its requirement by submitting such technical data directly to the Government, rather than through a higher tier contractor, subcontractor, or supplier.

(4) The Contractor and higher tier subcontractors or suppliers shall not use their power to award contracts as economic leverage to obtain rights in technical data or computer software from their subcontractors or suppliers.

(5) In no event shall the Contractor use its obligation to recognize and protect subcontractor or supplier rights in technical data or computer software as an excuse for failing to satisfy its contractual obligation to the Government.
