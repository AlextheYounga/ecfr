As prescribed at 227.7009-2(b), insert the following clause in patent releases, license agreements, and assignments:

Readjustment of Payments (SEP 2019)

(a) If any license, under substantially the same patents and authorizing substantially the same acts which are authorized under this contract, has been or shall hereafter be granted within the United States, on royalty terms which are more favorable to the licensee than those contained herein, the Government shall be entitled to the benefit of such more favorable terms with respect to all royalties accruing under this contract after the date such more favorable terms become effective, and the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the granting of such more favorable terms.

(b) In the event any claim of any patent hereby licensed is construed or held invalid by decision of a court of competent jurisdiction, the requirement to pay royalties under this contract insofar as its arises solely by reason of such claim, and any other claim not materially different therefrom, shall be interpreted in conformity with the court's decision as to the scope of validity of such claims; *Provided,* however, that in the event such decision is modified or reversed on appeal, the requirement to pay royalties under this contract shall be interpreted in conformity with the final decision rendered on such appeal.
