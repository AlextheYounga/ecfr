(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*Storage* means a non-transitory, semi-permanent or permanent holding, placement, or leaving of material. It does not include a temporary accumulation of a limited quantity of a material used in or a waste generated or resulting from authorized activities, such as servicing, maintenance, or repair of Department of Defense (DoD) items, equipment, or facilities.

*Toxic or hazardous materials* means—

(i) Materials referred to in section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601(14)) and materials designated under section 102 of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9602) (40 CFR Part 302);

A charge may be assessed for any storage or disposal authorized under any of the exceptions to 10 U.S.C. 2692. If a charge is to be assessed, then such assessment shall be identified elsewhere in the contract with payment to the Government on a reimbursable cost basis.

(End of clause)

*Alternate I.* As prescribed in 223.7106 and 223.7106(b), use the following clause, which adds a new paragraph (c) and revises and redesignates paragraph (c) of the basic clause as paragraph (d):

Prohibition on Storage, Treatment, and Disposal of Toxic or Hazardous Materials—Alternate I (SEP 2014)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*Storage* means a non-transitory, semi-permanent or permanent holding, placement, or leaving of material. It does not include a temporary accumulation of a limited quantity of a material used in or a waste generated or resulting from authorized activities, such as servicing, maintenance, or repair of Department of Defense (DoD) items, equipment, or facilities.

*Toxic or hazardous materials* means—

(i) Materials referred to in section 101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601(14)) and materials designated under section 102 of CERCLA (42 U.S.C. 9602) (40 CFR Part 302);

(ii) Materials that are of an explosive, flammable, or pyrotechnic nature; or

(iii) Materials otherwise identified by the Secretary of Defense as specified in DoD regulations.

(b) In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2692, the Contractor is prohibited from storing, treating, or disposing of toxic or hazardous materials not owned by DoD on a DoD installation, except to the extent authorized by a statutory exception to 10 U.S.C. 2692 or as authorized by the Secretary of Defense. A charge may be assessed for any storage or disposal authorized under any of the exceptions to 10 U.S.C. 2692. If a charge is to be assessed, then such assessment shall be identified elsewhere in the contract with payment to the Government on a reimbursable cost basis.

(c) With respect to treatment or disposal authorized pursuant to DFARS 223.7104(10) (10 U.S.C. 2692(b)(10), and notwithstanding any other provision of the contract, the Contractor assumes all financial and environmental responsibility and liability resulting from any treatment or disposal of toxic or hazardous materials not owned by DoD on a military installation. The Contractor shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Government harmless for all costs, liability, or penalties resulting from the Contractor's treatment or disposal of toxic or hazardous materials not owned by DoD on a military installation.

(d) The Contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in all subcontracts that require, may require, or permit a subcontractor access to a DoD installation, at any tier. Inclusion of the substance of this clause in subcontracts does not relieve the prime Contractor of liability to the Government under paragraph (c) of this clause.
