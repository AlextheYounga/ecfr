As prescribed in 223.303, use the following clause:

Hazard Warning Labels (DEC 1991)

(a) “Hazardous material,” as used in this clause, is defined in the Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data clause of this contract.

(b) The Contractor shall label the item package (unit container) of any hazardous material to be delivered under this contract in accordance with the Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200 *et seq*). The Standard requires that the hazard warning label conform to the requirements of the standard unless the material is otherwise subject to the labelling requirements of one of the following statutes:

(1) Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act;

(2) Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act;

(3) Consumer Product Safety Act;

(4) Federal Hazardous Substances Act; or

(5) Federal Alcohol Administration Act.

(c) The Offeror shall list which hazardous material listed in the Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data clause of this contract will be labelled in accordance with one of the Acts in paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) of this clause instead of the Hazard Communication Standard. Any hazardous material not listed will be interpreted to mean that a label is required in accordance with the Hazard Communication Standard.

(d) The apparently successful Offeror agrees to submit, before award, a copy of the hazard warning label for all hazardous materials not listed in paragraph (c) of this clause. The Offeror shall submit the label with the Material Safety Data Sheet being furnished under the Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data clause of this contract.

(e) The Contractor shall also comply with MIL-STD-129, Marking for Shipment and Storage (including revisions adopted during the term of this contract).
