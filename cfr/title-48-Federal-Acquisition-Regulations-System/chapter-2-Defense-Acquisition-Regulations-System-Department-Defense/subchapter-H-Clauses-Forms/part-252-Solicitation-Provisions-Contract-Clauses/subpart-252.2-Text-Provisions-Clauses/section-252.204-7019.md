*Covered contractor information system* has the meaning given in the clause 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting, of this solicitation.

(b) *Requirement.* In order to be considered for award, if the Offeror is required to implement NIST SP 800-171, the Offeror shall have a current assessment (*i.e.,* not more than 3 years old unless a lesser time is specified in the solicitation) (see 252.204-7020) for each covered contractor information system that is relevant to the offer, contract, task order, or delivery order. The Basic, Medium, and High NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessments are described in the NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology located at *https://www.acq.osd.mil/dpap/pdi/cyber/strategically\_assessing\_contractor\_implementation\_of\_NIST\_SP\_800-171.html.*

(c) *Procedures.* (1) The Offeror shall verify that summary level scores of a current NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment (*i.e.,* not more than 3 years old unless a lesser time is specified in the solicitation) are posted in the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) (*https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/*) for all covered contractor information systems relevant to the offer.

(2) If the Offeror does not have summary level scores of a current NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment (*i.e.,* not more than 3 years old unless a lesser time is specified in the solicitation) posted in SPRS, the Offeror may conduct and submit a Basic Assessment to *webptsmh@navy.mil* for posting to SPRS in the format identified in paragraph (d) of this provision.

(d) *Summary level scores.* Summary level scores for all assessments will be posted 30 days post-assessment in SPRS to provide DoD Components visibility into the summary level scores of strategic assessments.

(1) *Basic Assessments.* An Offeror may follow the procedures in paragraph (c)(2) of this provision for posting Basic Assessments to SPRS.

(i) The email shall include the following information:

(A) Cybersecurity standard assessed (*e.g.,* NIST SP 800-171 Rev 1).

(B) Organization conducting the assessment (*e.g.,* Contractor self-assessment).

(C) For each system security plan (security requirement 3.12.4) supporting the performance of a DoD contract -

(*1*) All industry Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code(s) associated with the information system(s) addressed by the system security plan; and

(*2*) A brief description of the system security plan architecture, if more than one plan exists.

(D) Date the assessment was completed.

(E) Summary level score (*e.g.,* 95 out of 110, NOT the individual value for each requirement).

(F) Date that all requirements are expected to be implemented (*i.e.,* a score of 110 is expected to be achieved) based on information gathered from associated plan(s) of action developed in accordance with NIST SP 800-171.

(ii) If multiple system security plans are addressed in the email described at paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, the Offeror shall use the following format for the report:

|System security plan|CAGE codes supported by this plan|Brief description of the plan architecture|Date of  <br/>assessment|Total score|Date score of 110 will achieved|
|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|

(ii) Organization conducting the assessment, *e.g.,* DCMA, or a specific organization (identified by Department of Defense Activity Address Code (DoDAAC)).

(iii) All industry CAGE code(s) associated with the information system(s) addressed by the system security plan.
