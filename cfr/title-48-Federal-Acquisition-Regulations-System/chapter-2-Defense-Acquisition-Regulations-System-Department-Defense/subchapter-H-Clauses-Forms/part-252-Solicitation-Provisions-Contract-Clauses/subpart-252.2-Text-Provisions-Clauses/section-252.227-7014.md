(4) When requested by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to evaluate the Contractor's assertions. The Contracting Officer reserves the right to add the Contractor's assertions to the Attachment and validate any listed assertion, at a later date, in accordance with the procedures in the DFARS 252.227-7019, Validation of Asserted Restrictions—Computer Software, clause of this contract.

(g) *Marking requirements.* The Contractor, and its subcontractors or suppliers, may only assert restrictions on the Government's rights to use, modify, reproduce, release, perform, display, or disclose computer software by marking the deliverable software or documentation subject to restriction. Except as provided in paragraph (g)(6) of this clause, only the following legends are authorized under this contract: the government purpose rights legend at paragraph (g)(3) of this clause; the restricted rights legend at paragraph (g)(4) of this clause; the special license rights legend at paragraph (g)(5) of this clause; and a notice of copyright as prescribed under 17 U.S.C. 401 or 402.

(1) *General marking instructions.* The Contractor, or its subcontractors or suppliers, shall conspicuously and legibly mark the appropriate legend on all computer software that qualify for such markings. The authorized legends shall be placed on the transmitted document or software storage container and each page, or portions thereof, of printed material containing computer software for which restrictions are asserted. Computer software transmitted directly from one computer or computer terminal to another shall contain a notice of asserted restrictions. However, instructions that interfere with or delay the operation of computer software in order to display a restrictive rights legend or other license statement at any time prior to or during use of the computer software, or otherwise cause such interference or delay, shall not be inserted in software that will or might be used in combat or situations that simulate combat conditions, unless the Contracting Officer's written permission to deliver such software has been obtained prior to delivery. Reproductions of computer software, or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, shall also reproduce the asserted restrictions.

(2) *Omitted markings.* (i) Computer software or computer software documentation delivered or otherwise provided under this contract without restrictive markings will be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights. To the extent practicable, if the Contractor has requested permission (see paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this clause) to correct an inadvertent omission of markings, the Contracting Officer will not release or disclose the software or documentation pending evaluation of the request.

(ii) The Contractor may request permission to have conforming and justified restrictive markings placed on unmarked computer software or computer software documentation at its expense. The request must be received by the Contracting Officer within 6 months following the furnishing or delivery of such software or documentation, or any extension of that time approved by the Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall—

(A) Identify the software or documentation that should have been marked;

(B) Demonstrate that the omission of the marking was inadvertent, the proposed marking is justified and conforms with the requirements for the marking of computer software or computer software documentation contained in this clause; and

(C) Acknowledge, in writing, that the Government has no liability with respect to any disclosure, reproduction, or use of the software or documentation made prior to the addition of the marking or resulting from the omission of the marking.

(3) *Government purpose rights markings.* Computer software delivered or otherwise furnished to the Government with government purpose rights shall be marked as follows:
