(i) Assigned to duty outside the United States for the performance of this contract; and

(ii) Found to be missing from his or her place of employment under circumstances that make it appear probable that the absence is due to the action of the force of any power not allied with the United States in a common military effort; or

(A) Engaged in activity directly arising out of and in the course of employment under this contract; or

(B) Captured in an area where required to be only in order to perform this contract.

(2) A *period of detention* begins with the day of capture and continues until the captured person is returned to the place of employment, the United States, or is able to be returned to the jurisdiction of the United States, or until the person's death is established or legally presumed to have occurred by evidence satisfactory to the Contracting Officer, whichever occurs first.

(3) *United States* comprises geographically the 50 states and the District of Columbia.

(4) *War Hazards Compensation Act* refers to the statute compiled in chapter 12 of title 42, U.S. Code (sections 1701-1717), as amended.

(b) If pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to capture, the Contractor is obligated to pay and has paid detention benefits to a captured person, or the person's dependents, the Government will reimburse the Contractor up to an amount equal to the lesser of—

(1) Total wage or salary being paid at the time of capture due from the Contractor to the captured person for the period of detention; or

(2) That amount which would have been payable if the detention had occurred under circumstances covered by the War Hazards Compensation Act.

(c) The period of detention shall not be considered as time spent in contract performance, and the Government shall not be obligated to make payment for that time except as provided in this clause.

(d) The obligation of the Government shall apply to the entire period of detention, except that it is subject to the availability of funds from which payment can be made. The rights and obligations of the parties under this clause shall survive prior expiration, completion, or termination of this contract.
