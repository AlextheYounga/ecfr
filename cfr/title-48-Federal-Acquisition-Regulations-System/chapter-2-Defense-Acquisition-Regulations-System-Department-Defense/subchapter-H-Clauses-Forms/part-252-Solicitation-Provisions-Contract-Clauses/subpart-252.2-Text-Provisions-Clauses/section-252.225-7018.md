Photovoltaic Devices—Certificate (DEC 2022)

(a) *Definitions.* “Bahrainian photovoltaic device,” “Caribbean Basin photovoltaic device,” “designated country,” “designated country photovoltaic device,” “domestic photovoltaic device,” “foreign photovoltaic device,” “Free Trade Agreement country,” “Free Trade Agreement photovoltaic device,” “Korean photovoltaic device,” “least developed country photovoltaic device,” “Moroccan photovoltaic device,” “Panamanian photovoltaic device,” “Peruvian photovoltaic device,” “photovoltaic device,” “qualifying country,” “qualifying country photovoltaic device,” “United States,” “U.S.-made photovoltaic device,” and “WTO GPA country photovoltaic device” have the meanings given in the Photovoltaic Devices clause of this solicitation.

(b) *Restrictions.* The following restrictions apply, depending on the estimated aggregate value of photovoltaic devices to be utilized under a resultant contract:

(1) If more than the micro-purchase threshold but less than $183,000, then the Government will not accept an offer specifying the use of other foreign photovoltaic devices in paragraph (d)(2)(ii), (d)(3)(ii), (d)(4)(ii), or (d)(5)(ii) of this provision, unless the offeror documents to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer that the price of the foreign photovoltaic device plus 50 percent is less than the price of a comparable domestic photovoltaic device.

(2) If $183,000 or more, then the Government will consider only offers that utilize photovoltaic devices that are U.S.-made, qualifying country, or designated country photovoltaic devices.

(c) *Country in which a designated country photovoltaic device was wholly manufactured or was substantially transformed.* If the estimated value of the photovoltaic devices to be utilized under a resultant contract exceeds $92,319, the Offeror's certification that such photovoltaic device (e.g., solar panel) is a designated country photovoltaic device shall be consistent with country of origin determinations by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection with regard to importation of the same or similar photovoltaic devices into the United States. If the Offeror is uncertain as to what the country of origin would be determined to be by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Offeror shall request a determination from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. (See *http://www.cbp.gov/trade/rulings*.)

(d) *Certification and identification of country of origin. [The offeror shall check the block and fill in the blank for one of the following paragraphs, based on the estimated value and the country of origin of photovoltaic devices to be utilized in performance of the contract:]*

(4) If $92,319 or more but less than $100,000—

\_\_\_\_ (i) The offeror certifies that each photovoltaic device to be utilized in performance of the contract is a domestic photovoltaic device;

\_\_\_\_ (ii) The offeror certifies that each photovoltaic device to be utilized in performance of the contract is a Free Trade Agreement country photovoltaic device (other than a Bahrainian, Korean, Moroccan, Panamanian, or Peruvian photovoltaic device) or a qualifying country photovoltaic device *[Offeror to specify country of origin\_\_\_\_\_\_];* or

\_\_\_\_ (iii) The offered foreign photovoltaic devices (other than those from countries listed in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this provision) are the product of \_\_\_\_\_\_. *[Offeror to specify country of origin, if known, and provide documentation that the cost of a domestic photovoltaic device would be unreasonable in comparison to the cost of the proposed foreign photovoltaic device, i.e. that the price of the foreign photovoltaic device plus 50 percent is less than the price of a comparable domestic photovoltaic device.]*

(5) If $100,000 or more but less than $183,000—

\_\_\_\_ (i) The offeror certifies that each photovoltaic device to be utilized in performance of the contract is a domestic photovoltaic device;

\_\_\_\_ (ii) The offeror certifies that each photovoltaic device to be utilized in performance of the contract is a Free Trade Agreement country photovoltaic device (other than a Bahrainian, Moroccan, Panamanian, or Peruvian photovoltaic device) or a qualifying country photovoltaic device *[Offeror to specify country of origin\_\_\_\_\_\_];* or

\_\_\_\_ (iii) The offered foreign photovoltaic devices (other than those from countries listed in paragraph (d)(5)(ii) of this provision) are the product of \_\_\_\_\_\_. *[Offeror to specify country of origin, if known, and provide documentation that the cost of a domestic photovoltaic device would be unreasonable in comparison to the cost of the proposed foreign photovoltaic device, i.e. that the price of the foreign photovoltaic device plus 50 percent is less than the price of a comparable domestic photovoltaic device.]*
