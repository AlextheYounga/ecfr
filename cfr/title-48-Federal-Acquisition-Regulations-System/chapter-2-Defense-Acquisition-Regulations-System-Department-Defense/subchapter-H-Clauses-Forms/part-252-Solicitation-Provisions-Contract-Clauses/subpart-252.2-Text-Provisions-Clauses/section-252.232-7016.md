##### 252.232-7016 Notice of Progress Payments or Performance-Based Payments. #####

As prescribed in 232.1005-70(c), insert the following provision:

Notice of Progress Payments or Performance-Based Payments (APR 2020)

(a) The need for customary progress payments in accordance with subpart 32.5 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) or performance-based payments in accordance with FAR subpart 32.10 will not be considered as a handicap or adverse factor in the award of the contract.

(b) This solicitation includes a FAR and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clause for performance-based payments and a FAR clause for progress payments. The resultant contract will include either performance-based payments or progress payments, not both, except as may be authorized on separate orders subject to FAR 32.1003(c).

(1) The performance-based payments clauses will be included in the contract if—

(i) The Offeror has provided positive representation in response to DFARS 252.232-7015, Performance-Based Payments—Representation;

(ii) The Offeror proposes a performance-based payment arrangement in accordance with FAR 52.232-28, Invitation to Propose Performance-Based Payments, including proposed events and timing, event completion criteria, event values, and expected expenditure profile; and

(iii) The Offeror and the Government reach agreement on all aspects of the arrangement.

(2) If performance-based payments clauses are not included in the resultant contract, the progress payments clause included in this solicitation will be included in any resultant contract, modified or altered if necessary in accordance with FAR 52.232-16 and its Alternate I. Even though the progress payments clause is included in the contract, the clause shall be inoperative during any time the contractor's accounting system and controls are determined by the Government to be inadequate for segregation and accumulation of contract costs.
