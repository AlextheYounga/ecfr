As prescribed at 227.7103-6(e)(2) or 227.7104(e)(4), use the following clause:

Technical Data—Withholding of Payment (MAR 2000)

(a) If technical data specified to be delivered under this contract, is not delivered within the time specified by this contract or is deficient upon delivery (including having restrictive markings not identified in the list described in the clause at 252.227-7013(e)(2) or 252.227-7018(e)(2) of this contract), the Contracting Officer may until such data is accepted by the Government, withhold payment to the Contractor of ten percent (10%) of the total contract price or amount unless a lesser withholding is specified in the contract. Payments shall not be withheld nor any other action taken pursuant to this paragraph when the Contractor's failure to make timely delivery or to deliver such data without deficiencies arises out of causes beyond the control and without the fault or negligence of the Contractor.

(b) The withholding of any amount or subsequent payment to the Contractor shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights accruing to the Government under this contract.
