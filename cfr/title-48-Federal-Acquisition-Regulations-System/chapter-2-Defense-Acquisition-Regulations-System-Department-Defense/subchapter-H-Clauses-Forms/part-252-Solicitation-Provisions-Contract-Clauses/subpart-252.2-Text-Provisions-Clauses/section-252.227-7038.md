*Subject invention* means any invention of the Contractor made in the performance of work under this contract.

(b) *Contractor's rights*—(1) *Ownership.* The Contractor may elect to retain ownership of each subject invention throughout the world in accordance with the provisions of this clause.

(2) *License.* (i) The Contractor shall retain a nonexclusive royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, unless the Contractor fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause. The Contractor's license-

(B) Includes the right to grant sublicenses to the extent the Contractor was legally obligated to do so at the time of contract award; and

(B) Will not revoke the license in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Contractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably accessible to the public; and

(c) *Contractor's obligations.* (1) The Contractor shall—

(iii) After submission of the disclosure, promptly notify the Contracting Officer of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication and of any on sale or public use.

(2) The Contractor shall elect in writing whether or not to retain ownership of any subject invention by notifying the Contracting Officer at the time of disclosure or within 8 months of disclosure, as to those countries (including the United States) in which the Contractor will retain ownership. However, in any case where publication, on sale, or public use has initiated the 1-year statutory period during which valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States, the agency may shorten the period of election of title to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.

(3) The Contractor shall—

(i) File either a provisional or a nonprovisional patent application on an elected subject invention within 1 year after election, provided that in all cases the application is filed prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use;

(ii) File a nonprovisional application within 10 months of the filing of any provisional application; and

(4) The Contractor may request extensions of time for disclosure, election, or filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this clause. The Contracting Officer will normally grant the extension unless there is reason to believe the extension would prejudice the Government's interests.

(iii) In those countries in which the Contractor fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, provided that, if the Contractor has filed a patent application in a country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this clause, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the agency, the Contractor shall continue to retain ownership in that country; and

(iv) In any country in which the Contractor decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.

(3) The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of any decisions not to file a nonprovisional patent application, continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response or filing period required by the relevant patent office.

(4) The Contractor shall include, within the specification of any United States nonprovisional patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention, the following statement: “This invention was made with Government support under (identify the contract) awarded by (identify the agency).

(g) *Preference for United States industry.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this clause, the Contractor agrees that neither the Contractor nor any assignee shall grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States unless the person agrees that any products embodying the subject invention or produced through the use of the subject invention will be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the agency may waive the requirement for an exclusive license agreement upon a showing by the Contractor or its assignee that—

(ii) Shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (l), in all other subcontracts for experimental, developmental, or research work, unless a different patent rights clause is required by FAR 27.303.

(2) For subcontracts at any tier—
