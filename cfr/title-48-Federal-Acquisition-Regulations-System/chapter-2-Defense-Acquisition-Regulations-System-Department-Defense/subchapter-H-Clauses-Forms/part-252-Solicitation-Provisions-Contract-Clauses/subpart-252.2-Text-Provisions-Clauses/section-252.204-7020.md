##### 252.204-7020 NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Requirements. #####

As prescribed in 204.7304(e), use the following clause:

NIST SP 800-171 DOD ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS (MAR 2022)

(a) *Definitions.*

*Basic Assessment* means a contractor's self-assessment of the contractor's implementation of NIST SP 800-171 that -

(1) Is based on the Contractor's review of their system security plan(s) associated with covered contractor information system(s);

(2) Is conducted in accordance with the NIST SP 800-171 DoD Assessment Methodology; and

(3) Results in a confidence level of “Low” in the resulting score, because it is a self-generated score.

*Covered contractor information system* has the meaning given in the clause 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting, of this contract.

*High Assessment* means an assessment that is conducted by Government personnel using NIST SP 800-171A, Assessing Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information that -

(1) Consists of -

(i) A review of a contractor's Basic Assessment;

(ii) A thorough document review;

(iii) Verification, examination, and demonstration of a Contractor's system security plan to validate that NIST SP 800-171 security requirements have been implemented as described in the contractor's system security plan; and

(iv) Discussions with the contractor to obtain additional information or clarification, as needed; and

(2) Results in a confidence level of “High” in the resulting score.

*Medium Assessment* means an assessment conducted by the Government that -

(1) Consists of -

(i) A review of a contractor's Basic Assessment;

(ii) A thorough document review; and

(iii) Discussions with the contractor to obtain additional information or clarification, as needed; and

(2) Results in a confidence level of “Medium” in the resulting score.

(b) *Applicability.* This clause applies to covered contractor information systems that are required to comply with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171, in accordance with Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation System (DFARS) clause at 252.204-7012, Safeguarding Covered Defense Information and Cyber Incident Reporting, of this contract.

(*2*) A brief description of the system security plan architecture, if more than one plan exists.

(D) Date the assessment was completed.

(E) Summary level score (*e.g.,* 95 out of 110, NOT the individual value for each requirement).

(F) Date that all requirements are expected to be implemented (*i.e.,* a score of 110 is expected to be achieved) based on information gathered from associated plan(s) of action developed in accordance with NIST SP 800-171.

(ii) If multiple system security plans are addressed in the email described at paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the Contractor shall use the following format for the report:

|System security plan|CAGE codes supported by this plan|Brief description of the plan architecture|Date of  <br/>assessment|Total score|Date score of 110 will achieved|
|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------|
