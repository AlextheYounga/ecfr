(b) *Restriction.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause—

(i) Effective through December 31, 2026, the Contractor shall not deliver under this contract any covered material melted or produced in any covered country, or any end item, manufactured in any covered country, that contains a covered material; and

(ii) Effective January 1, 2027, the Contractor shall not deliver under this contract any covered material mined, refined, separated, melted, or produced in any covered country, or any end item, manufactured in any covered country, that contains a covered material (section 854, Pub. L. 118-31; 10 U.S.C. 4872).

(2)(i)(A) Effective through December 31, 2026, for samarium-cobalt magnets and neodymium-iron-boron magnets, this restriction includes—

(*1*) Melting samarium with cobalt to produce the samarium-cobalt alloy or melting neodymium with iron and boron to produce the neodymium-iron-boron alloy; and

(*2*) All subsequent phases of production of the magnets, such as powder formation, pressing, sintering or bonding, and magnetization.

(B) Effective January 1, 2027, for samarium-cobalt magnets this restriction includes the entire supply chain from mining or production of a cobalt and samarium ore or feedstock, including recycled material, through production of finished magnets.

(ii) The restriction on melting and producing of samarium-cobalt magnets is in addition to any applicable restrictions on melting of specialty metals if the clause at 252.225-7009, Restriction on Acquisition of Certain Articles Containing Specialty Metals, is included in the contract.

(3) Effective January 1, 2027, for neodymium-iron-boron magnets, this restriction includes entire supply chain from mining of neodymium, iron, and boron through production of finished magnets.

(4)(i) Effective through December 31, 2026, for production of tantalum metals of any kind and alloys, this restriction includes the reduction or melting of any form of tantalum to create tantalum metal including unwrought, powder, mill products, and alloys. The restriction also covers all subsequent phases of production of tantalum metals and alloys.

(ii) Effective January 1, 2027, for production of tantalum metals of any kind and alloys, this restriction includes mining or production of a tantalum ore or feedstock, including recycled material, through production of metals of any kind and alloys.

(5)(i) Effective through December 31, 2026, for production of tungsten metal powder and tungsten heavy alloy, this restriction includes—

(ii) Effective January 1, 2027, for production of tungsten metal powder, tungsten heavy alloy, or any finished or semi-finished component containing tungsten heavy alloy, this restriction includes mining or production of a tungsten ore or feedstock, including recycled material, through production of tungsten metal powders, tungsten heavy alloy, or any finished or semi-finished component containing tungsten heavy alloy.

(c) *Exceptions.* This clause does not apply—
