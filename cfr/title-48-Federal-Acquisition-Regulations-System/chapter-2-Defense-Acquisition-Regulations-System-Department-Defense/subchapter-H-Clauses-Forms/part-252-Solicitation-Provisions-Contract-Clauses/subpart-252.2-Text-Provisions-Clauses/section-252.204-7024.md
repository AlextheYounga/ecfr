As prescribed in 204.7604, use the following provision:

Notice on the Use of the Supplier Performance Risk System (MAR 2023)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this provisionâ€”

*Item risk* means the probability that a product, based on intended use, will introduce performance risk resulting in safety issues, mission degradation, or monetary loss.

*Price risk* means a measure of whether a proposed price for a product or service is consistent with historical prices paid for that item or service.

*Supplier risk* means the probability that an award may subject the procurement to the risk of unsuccessful performance or to supply chain risk (see Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 239.7301).

(b) The Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS), available at *https://piee.eb.mil/,* will be used in the evaluation of the Quoter or Offeror's performance. SPRS retrieves item, price, quality, delivery, and contractor information on contracts from Government reporting systems in order to develop risk assessments.

(c) The Contracting Officer will consider SPRS risk assessments during the evaluation of quotations or offers received in response to this solicitation as follows:

(1) Item risk will be considered to determine whether the procurement represents a high performance risk to the Government.

(2) Price risk will be considered in determining if a proposed price is consistent with historical prices paid for a product or a service or otherwise creates a risk to the Government.

(3) Supplier risk, including but not limited to quality and delivery, will be considered to assess the risk of unsuccessful performance and supply chain risk.

(d) SPRS risk assessments are generated daily. Quoters or Offerors are able to access their risk assessments by following the access instructions in the SPRS user's guide available at *https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/reference.htm.* Quoters and Offerors are granted access to SPRS for their own risk assessment classifications only. SPRS reporting procedures and risk assessment methodology are detailed in the SPRS user's guide. The method to challenge a rating generated by SPRS is also provided in the user's guide. SPRS evaluation criteria are available at *https://www.sprs.csd.disa.mil/pdf/SPRS\_DataEvaluationCriteria.pdf.*

(e) The Contracting Officer may consider any other available and relevant information when evaluating a quotation or an offer.
