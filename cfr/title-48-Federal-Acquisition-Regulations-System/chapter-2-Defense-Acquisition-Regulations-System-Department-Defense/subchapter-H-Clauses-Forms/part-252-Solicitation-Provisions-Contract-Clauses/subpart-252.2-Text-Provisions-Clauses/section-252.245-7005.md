Management and Reporting of Government Property (Jan 2024)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*As is* means that the Government makes no warranty with respect to the serviceability and/or suitability of the Government property for contract performance and that the Government will not pay for any repairs, replacement, and/or refurbishment of the property.

*Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code* means—

(1) An identifier assigned to entities located in the United States or its outlying areas by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch to identify a commercial or government entity by unique location; or

(2) An identifier assigned by a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) or by the NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) to entities located outside the United States and its outlying areas that the DLA Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Branch records and maintains in the CAGE master file. This type of code is known as a NATO CAGE (NCAGE) code.

*Contractor-acquired property, contractor inventory, Government property, Government-furnished property,* and *loss of Government property* have the meanings given in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.245-1, Government Property, clause of this contract.

*Demilitarization* means the act of eliminating the functional capabilities and inherent military design features from DoD personal property. Methods and degree range from removal and destruction of critical features to total destruction by cutting, tearing, crushing, mangling, shredding, melting, burning, etc.

*Export-controlled items* has the meaning given in the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 252.225-7048, Export-Controlled Items, clause of this contract.

*Ineligible transferee* means an individual, an entity, or a country—

*Reparable item* means an item, typically in unserviceable condition, furnished to the contractor for maintenance, repair, modification, or overhaul.

*Scrap* means property that has no value except for its basic material content. For purposes of demilitarization, scrap is defined as recyclable waste and discarded materials derived from items that have been rendered useless beyond repair, rehabilitation, or restoration such that the item's original identity, utility, form, fit, and function have been destroyed. Items can be classified as scrap if processed by cutting, tearing, crushing, mangling, shredding, or melting. Intact or recognizable components and parts are not “scrap.”

(i) Report receipt of GFP;

(vii) Submit a request to buy back or to convert to GFP items of Contractor-acquired property.

(2) Information regarding the GFP module is available in the GFP Module Vendor Guide at *https://dodprocurementtoolbox.com/site-pages/gfp-resources.* Users may also register for access to the GFP module and obtain training on the PIEE home page at *https://piee.eb.mil.*

(3) Received/sent (shipped) date.

(4) Accountable Government contract number.

(5) Serial number (for serially-managed items that do not have a UII); and
