(1) For items that are serialized within the enterprise identifier, the linking together of the unique identifier data elements in order of the issuing agency code, enterprise identifier, and unique serial number within the enterprise identifier; or

(2) For items that are serialized within the original part, lot, or batch number, the linking together of the unique identifier data elements in order of the issuing agency code; enterprise identifier; original part, lot, or batch number; and serial number within the original part, lot, or batch number.

*Data matrix* means a two-dimensional matrix symbology, which is made up of square or, in some cases, round modules arranged within a perimeter finder pattern and uses the Error Checking and Correction 200 (ECC200) specification found within International Standards Organization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 16022.

*Data qualifier* means a specified character (or string of characters) that immediately precedes a data field that defines the general category or intended use of the data that follows.

*DoD recognized unique identification equivalent* means a unique identification method that is in commercial use and has been recognized by DoD. All DoD recognized unique identification equivalents are listed at *https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/ds/unique-id.html.*

*DoD item unique identification* means a system of marking items delivered to DoD with unique item identifiers that have machine-readable data elements to distinguish an item from all other like and unlike items. For items that are serialized within the enterprise identifier, the unique item identifier shall include the data elements of the enterprise identifier and a unique serial number. For items that are serialized within the part, lot, or batch number within the enterprise identifier, the unique item identifier shall include the data elements of the enterprise identifier; the original part, lot, or batch number; and the serial number.

*Enterprise* means the entity (*e.g.*, a manufacturer or vendor) responsible for assigning unique item identifiers to items.

*Enterprise identifier* means a code that is uniquely assigned to an enterprise by an issuing agency.

*Government's unit acquisition cost* means—

(1) For fixed-price type line, subline, or exhibit line items, the unit price identified in the contract at the time of delivery;

(2) For cost-type or undefinitized line, subline, or exhibit line items, the Contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery; and

(3) For items produced under a time-and-materials contract, the Contractor's estimated fully burdened unit cost to the Government at the time of delivery.

*Issuing agency* means an organization responsible for assigning a globally unique identifier to an enterprise, as indicated in the Register of Issuing Agency Codes for ISO/IEC 15459, located at *http://www.aimglobal.org/?Reg\_Authority15459.*

*Issuing agency code* means a code that designates the registration (or controlling) authority for the enterprise identifier.

*Item* means a single hardware article or a single unit formed by a grouping of subassemblies, components, or constituent parts.

*Lot or batch number* means an identifying number assigned by the enterprise to a designated group of items, usually referred to as either a lot or a batch, all of which were manufactured under identical conditions.

*Machine-readable* means an automatic identification technology media, such as bar codes, contact memory buttons, radio frequency identification, or optical memory cards.

*Original part number* means a combination of numbers or letters assigned by the enterprise at item creation to a class of items with the same form, fit, function, and interface.

*Parent item* means the item assembly, intermediate component, or subassembly that has an embedded item with a unique item identifier or DoD recognized unique identification equivalent.

*Serial number within the enterprise identifier* means a combination of numbers, letters, or symbols assigned by the enterprise to an item that provides for the differentiation of that item from any other like and unlike item and is never used again within the enterprise.

*Serial number within the part, lot, or batch number* means a combination of numbers or letters assigned by the enterprise to an item that provides for the differentiation of that item from any other like item within a part, lot, or batch number assignment.

*Serialization within the enterprise identifier* means each item produced is assigned a serial number that is unique among all the tangible items produced by the enterprise and is never used again. The enterprise is responsible for ensuring unique serialization within the enterprise identifier.

*Serialization within the part, lot, or batch number* means each item of a particular part, lot, or batch number is assigned a unique serial number within that part, lot, or batch number assignment. The enterprise is responsible for ensuring unique serialization within the part, lot, or batch number within the enterprise identifier.

*Type designation* means a combination of letters and numerals assigned by the Government to a major end item, assembly or subassembly, as appropriate, to provide a convenient means of differentiating between items having the same basic name and to indicate modifications and changes thereto.

*Unique item identifier* means a set of data elements marked on items that is globally unique and unambiguous. The term includes a concatenated unique item identifier or a DoD recognized unique identification equivalent.

*Unique item identifier type* means a designator to indicate which method of uniquely identifying a part has been used. The current list of accepted unique item identifier types is maintained at *https://www.acq.osd.mil/asda/dpc/ce/ds/unique-id.html .*
