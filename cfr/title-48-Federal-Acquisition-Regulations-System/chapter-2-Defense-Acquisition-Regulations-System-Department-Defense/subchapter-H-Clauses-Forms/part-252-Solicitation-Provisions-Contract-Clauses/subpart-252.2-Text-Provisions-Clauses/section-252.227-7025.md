(i) The technical data or computer software will be accessed and used for the sole purpose of furnishing independent and impartial advice or technical assistance directly to the Government in support of the Government's management and oversight of the program or effort to which such technical data or computer software relates, as stated in this contract, and shall not be used to compete for any Government or non-Government contract;

(ii) The Contractor will take all reasonable steps to protect the technical data or computer software against any unauthorized release or disclosure;

(iii) The Contractor will ensure that the party whose name appears in the legend is notified of the access or use within 30 days of the Contractor's access or use of such data or software;

(iv) The Contractor will enter into a nondisclosure agreement with the party whose name appears in the legend, if required to do so by that party, and that any such nondisclosure agreement will implement the restrictions on the Contractor's use of such data or software as set forth in this clause. The nondisclosure agreement shall not include any additional terms and conditions unless mutually agreed to by the parties to the nondisclosure agreement; and

(v) That a breach of these obligations or restrictions may subject the Contractor to—

(c) *Indemnification and creation of third party beneficiary rights.* The Contractor agrees—

(1) To indemnify and hold harmless the Government, its agents, and employees from every claim or liability, including attorneys fees, court costs, and expenses, arising out of, or in any way related to, the misuse or unauthorized modification, reproduction, release, performance, display, or disclosure of technical data or computer software received from the Government with restrictive legends by the Contractor or any person to whom the Contractor has released or disclosed such data or software; and

(2) That the party whose name appears on the restrictive legend, in addition to any other rights it may have, is a third-party beneficiary who has the right of direct action against the Contractor, or any person to whom the Contractor has released or disclosed such data or software, for the unauthorized duplication, release, or disclosure of technical data or computer software subject to restrictive legends.
