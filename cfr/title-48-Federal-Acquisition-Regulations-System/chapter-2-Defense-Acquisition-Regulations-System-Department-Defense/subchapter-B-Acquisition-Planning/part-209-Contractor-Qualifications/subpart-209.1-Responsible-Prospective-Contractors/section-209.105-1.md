##### 209.105-1 Obtaining information. #####

(1) For guidance on using the Exclusions section of the System for Award Management, see PGI 209.105-1.

(2) A satisfactory performance record is a factor in determining contractor responsibility (*see* FAR 9.104-1(c)). One source of information relating to contractor performance is the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), available at *http://www.ppirs.gov.* Information relating to contract terminations for cause and for default is also available through PPIRS (see subpart 42.15). This termination information is just one consideration in determining contractor responsibility.
