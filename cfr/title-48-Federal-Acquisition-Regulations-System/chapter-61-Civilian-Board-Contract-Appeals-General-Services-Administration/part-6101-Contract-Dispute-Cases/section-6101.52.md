##### 6101.52 Small claims procedure [Rule 52]. #####

(a) *Election.* (1) The small claims procedure is available solely at the appellant's election. Such election shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the appellant's receipt of the agency answer, unless the presiding judge enlarges the time for good cause shown. The appellant may elect this procedure when:

(i) There is a monetary amount in dispute and that amount is $50,000 or less, or

(ii)(A) There is a monetary amount in dispute and that amount is $150,000 or less, and

(B) The appellant is a small business concern (as that term is defined in the Small Business Act and regulations promulgated under that Act).

(2) At the request of the respondent, or on its own initiative, the Board may determine whether the amount in dispute and/or the appellant's status makes the election inappropriate. The respondent shall raise any objection to the election no later than 10 working days after receipt of a notice of election.

(b) *Decision.* The presiding judge may issue a decision, which may be in summary form, orally or in writing. A decision which is issued orally shall be reduced to writing; however, such a decision takes effect at the time it is rendered, prior to being reduced to writing. A decision shall be final and conclusive and shall not be set aside except in case of fraud. A decision shall have no value as precedent.

(c) *Procedure.* Promptly after receipt of the appellant's election of the small claims procedure, the Board shall establish a schedule of proceedings that will allow for the timely resolution of the appeal. Pleadings, discovery, and other prehearing activities may be restricted or eliminated.

(d) *Time of decision.* Whenever possible, the presiding judge shall resolve an appeal under this procedure within 120 calendar days from the Board's receipt of the election. The time for processing an appeal under this procedure may be extended if the appellant has not adhered to the established schedule. Either party's failure to abide by the Board's schedule may result in the Board drawing evidentiary inferences adverse to the party at fault.
