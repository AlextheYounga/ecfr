##### 6101.27 Relief from decision or order [Rule 27]. #####

(a) *Grounds.* The Board may relieve a party from the operation of a final decision or order for any of the following reasons:

(1) Newly discovered evidence which could not have been earlier discovered, even through due diligence;

(2) Justifiable or excusable mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or neglect;

(3) Fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;

(4) The decision has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior decision upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, and it is no longer equitable that the decision should have prospective application;

(5) The decision is void, whether for lack of jurisdiction or otherwise; or

(6) Any other ground justifying relief from the operation of the decision or order.

(b) *Procedure.* Any motion under 6101.27 (Rule 27) shall comply with the provisions of 6101.8 and 6101.26(b) (Rules 8 and 26(b)), and will be considered and ruled upon by the Board as provided in 6101.26 (Rule 26).

(c) *Time for filing.* Any motion under 6101.27 (Rule 27) shall be filed as soon as practicable after the discovery of the reasons therefor, but in any event no later than 120 calendar days after the date of the moving party's receipt of the decision or order from which relief is sought. In considering the timeliness of a motion filed under 6101.27 (Rule 27), the Board may consider when the grounds therefor should reasonably have been known to the moving party.

(d) *Effect of motion.* A motion pending under 6101.27 (Rule 27) does not affect the finality of a decision or suspend its operation.
