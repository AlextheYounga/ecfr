##### 6101.9 Record of Board proceedings; review and copying [Rule 9]. #####

(a) *Composition of the record for decision.* The record upon which any decision of the Board will be rendered consists of:

(1) The notice of appeal, petition, or application;

(2) Appeal file exhibits other than those as to which an objection has been sustained;

(3) Hearing exhibits other than those as to which an objection has been sustained;

(4) Pleadings;

(5) Motions and responses thereto;

(6) Memoranda, orders, rulings, and directions to the parties issued by the Board;

(7) Documents and other tangible things admitted in evidence by the Board;

(8) Written transcripts or electronic recordings of proceedings;

(9) Stipulations and admissions by the parties;

(10) Depositions, or parts thereof, received in evidence;

(11) Written interrogatories and responses received in evidence;

(12) Briefs and memoranda of law; and

(13) Anything else that the Board may designate. All other papers and documents are part of the administrative record of the proceedings and are not included in the record upon which the Board's decision will be rendered.

(b) *Enlargement of the record.* The Board may at any time require or permit enlargement of the record with additional evidence and briefs. It may reopen the record to receive additional evidence and oral argument at a hearing.

(c) *Protected and in camera submissions.* (1) A party may by motion request that the Board receive and hold materials under conditions that would limit access to them on the ground that such documents are privileged or confidential, or sensitive in some other way. The moving party must state the grounds for such limited access. The Board may also determine on its own initiative to hold materials under such conditions. The manner in which such materials will be held, the persons who shall have access to them, and the conditions (if any) under which such access will be allowed will be specified in an order of the Board. If the materials are held under such an order, they will be part of the record of the case. If the Board denies the motion, the materials may be returned to the party that submitted them. If the moving party asks, however, that the materials be placed in the administrative record, *in camera*, for the purpose of possible later review of the Board's denial, the Board will comply with the request.

(2) A party may also ask, or the Board may direct, that testimony be received under protective order or *in camera.* The procedures under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall be followed with respect to such request or direction.

(d) *Review and copying.* Except for any part thereof that is subject to a protective order or deemed an *in camera* submission, the record in a Board proceeding shall be made available for review at the Office of the Clerk of the Board during the Board's normal working hours, as soon as practicable given the demands on the Board of processing the subject case and other cases. If a request is made for copies of documents, and if making such copies involves more than minimal costs to the Board, reimbursement will be required. If a request is made for a copy of a transcript which was prepared pursuant to a contract with the Board, the fee charged by the Board for a copy of the transcript will be at the rate established by the contract. When required, the Office of the Clerk will certify copies of papers and documents as a true record of the Board. Except as provided in 6101.17 and 6101.32 (Rules 17 and 32), the Office of the Clerk will not release any part of the record in its possession to anyone.
