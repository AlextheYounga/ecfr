(1) *Notice of appeal.* (i) A notice of appeal shall be in writing and shall be signed by the appellant or by the appellant's attorney or authorized representative. If the appeal is from a contracting officer's decision, the notice of appeal should describe the decision in enough detail to enable the Board to differentiate that decision from any other; the appellant can satisfy this requirement by attaching to the notice of appeal a copy of the contracting officer's decision. If an appeal is taken from the failure of a contracting officer to issue a decision, the notice of appeal should describe in detail the claim that the contracting officer has failed to decide; the appellant can satisfy this requirement by attaching a copy of the written claim submission to the notice of appeal.

(ii) A written notice in any form, including the one specified in the appendix to the rules in this chapter, is sufficient to initiate an appeal. The notice of appeal should include the following information:

(A) The number and date of the contract;

(B) The name of the government agency and the component thereof against which the claim has been asserted;

(C) The name, address, telephone number, facsimile machine number, and e-mail address, if available, of the contracting officer whose decision is appealed and the date of the decision;

(D) If the appeal is from the failure of the contracting officer to decide a claim, the name, address, telephone number, facsimile machine number, and e-mail address, if available, of the contracting officer who received the claim;

(E) A brief account of the circumstances giving rise to the appeal; and

(F) An estimate of the amount of money in controversy, if any and if known.

(iii) The appellant must send a copy of the notice of appeal to the contracting officer whose decision is appealed or, if there has been no decision, to the contracting officer before whom the appellant's claim is pending.

(2) *Petition.* (i) A petition shall be in writing and signed by the petitioner or by the petitioner's attorney or authorized representative. The petition should describe in detail the claim that the contracting officer has failed to decide; the contractor can satisfy this requirement by attaching to the petition a copy of the written claim submission.

(ii) The petition should include the following information:

(A) The number and date of the contract;

(B) The name of the government agency and the component thereof against which the claim has been asserted; and

(C) The name, address, telephone number, facsimile machine number, and e-mail address, if available, of the contracting officer whose decision is sought.

(3) *Application.* An application for fees and other expenses shall meet all requirements specified in 6101.30 (Rule 30).

(b) *Time limits for filing* - (1) *Appeals.* (i) An appeal from a decision of a contracting officer shall be filed no later than 90 calendar days after the date the appellant receives that decision.

(ii) An appeal may be filed with the Board if the contracting officer fails or refuses to issue a timely decision on a claim submitted in writing, properly certified if required.

(2) *Applications.* An application for fees and other expenses shall be filed within 30 calendar days of a final disposition in the underlying appeal, as provided in 6101.30 (Rule 30).

(c) *Notice of docketing.* Notices of appeal, petitions, and applications will be docketed by the Office of the Clerk of the Board, and a written notice of docketing will be sent promptly to all parties.

(d) *Consolidation.* When cases involving common questions of law or fact are filed, the Board may:

(1) Order the cases consolidated; or
