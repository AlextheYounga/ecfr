##### 6101.16 Subpoenas [Rule 16]. #####

(a) *Voluntary cooperation in lieu of subpoena.* Each party is expected to:

(1) Cooperate by making available witnesses and evidence under its control, when requested by another party, without issuance of a subpoena; and

(2) Secure the cooperation of third-party witnesses and production of evidence by third parties, when practicable, without issuance of a subpoena.

(b) *General.* Upon the written request of any party filed with the Office of the Clerk of the Board, or upon the initiative of a judge, a subpoena may be issued that commands the person to whom it is directed to:

(1) Attend and give testimony at a deposition in a city or county where that person resides or is employed or transacts business in person, or at another location convenient to that person that is specifically determined by the Board;

(2) Attend and give testimony at a hearing; and

(3) Produce the books, papers, documents, electronically stored information, and other tangible and intangible things designated in the subpoena.

(c) *Request for subpoena.* A request for a subpoena shall contain the name of the assigned judge, the name of the case, and the docket number of the case. It shall state the reasonable scope and general relevance to the case of the testimony and of any evidence sought. A request for a subpoena shall be filed at least 15 calendar days before the testimony of a witness or evidence is to be provided. The Board may, in its discretion, honor requests for subpoenas not made within this time limitation.

(d) *Form; issuance.* (1) Every subpoena shall be in the form specified in the appendix to the rules of this chapter and this form shall not be altered. Unless a party has the approval of a judge to submit a subpoena in blank (in whole or in part), a party shall submit to the judge a completed subpoena (save the “Return on Service” portion). In issuing a subpoena to a requesting party, the judge shall sign the subpoena. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall complete the subpoena before service.

(2) If the person subpoenaed is located in a foreign country, a letter rogatory or a subpoena may be issued and served under the circumstances and in the manner provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.

(e) *Service.* (1) The party requesting a subpoena shall arrange for service. Service shall be made as soon as practicable after the subpoena has been issued.

(2) A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition or hearing may be served at any place. A subpoena may be served by a United States marshal or deputy marshal, or by any other person who is not a party and not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by personal delivery of a copy to that person and tender of the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by 28 U.S.C. 1821 or other applicable law; however, where the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Government, money payments need not be tendered in advance of attendance.

(f) *Proof of service.* The person serving the subpoena shall make proof of service thereof to the Board promptly and in any event before the date on which the person served must respond to the subpoena. Proof of service shall be made by completion and execution and submission to the Board of the “Return on Service” portion of a duplicate copy of the subpoena issued by a judge. If service is made by a person other than a United States marshal or his deputy, that person shall make an affidavit as proof by executing the “Return on Service” in the presence of a notary.

(g) *Motion to quash or to modify.* Upon written motion by the person subpoenaed or by a party, made within 14 calendar days after service, but in any event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, the Board may quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown, or require the party in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable cost of producing subpoenaed evidence. Where circumstances require, the Board may act upon such a motion at any time after a copy has been served upon opposing parties.

(h) *Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena.* In a case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States district court, the Board shall apply to the court through the Attorney General of the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the Board to give testimony, produce evidence, or both.
