##### 6101.28 Full Board consideration [Rule 28]. #####

(a) *Requests by parties.* (1) A request for full Board consideration is not favored. Ordinarily, full Board consideration will be ordered only when it is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of Board decisions, or the matter to be referred is one of exceptional importance.

(2) A request for full Board consideration may be made by either party on any date which is both after the panel to which the case is assigned has issued its decision on a motion for reconsideration or relief from decision and within 10 working days after the date on which that party receives that decision. Any party making a request for full Board consideration shall state concisely in the motion the precise grounds on which the request is based.

(3) Promptly after such a request is made, a ballot will be taken among the judges; if a majority of them favors the request, the request will be granted. The result of the vote will promptly be reported by the Board through an order. The concurring or dissenting view of any judge who wishes to express such a view may issue at the time of such order or at any time thereafter.

(b) *Initiation by Board.* A majority of the judges may initiate full Board consideration of a matter at any time while the case is before the Board, no later than the last date on which any party may file a motion for reconsideration or relief from decision or order, or if such a motion is filed by a party, within ten days after a panel has resolved it. The parties will be informed promptly, through an order, of the matter to be considered by the full Board. The concurring or dissenting view of any judge who wishes to express such a view may issue at the time of such order or at any time thereafter.

(c) *Decisions.* If full Board consideration is granted at the request of a party or initiated by the Board, a vote shall be taken promptly on the pending matter. After this vote is taken, the Board shall promptly, by order, issue its determination, which shall include the concurring or dissenting view of any judge who wishes to express such a view.

(d) *Effect of motion.* A pending request for full Board consideration, whether initiated by a party or by the Board, does not affect the finality of a decision or suspend its operation.
