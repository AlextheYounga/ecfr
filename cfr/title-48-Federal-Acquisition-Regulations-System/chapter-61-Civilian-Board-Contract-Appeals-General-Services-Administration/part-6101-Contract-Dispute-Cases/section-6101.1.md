(a) *Scope.* The rules of this chapter govern proceedings in all cases filed with the Board on or after January 6, 2007, and all further proceedings in cases then pending, except to the extent that, in the opinion of the Board, their use in a particular case pending on the effective date would be infeasible or would work an injustice. The Board will look to the rules of this chapter for guidance in conducting other proceedings authorized by law.

A notice of appeal or an application for award of fees and other expenses is filed upon the earlier of its receipt by the Office of the Clerk of the Board or if mailed, the date on which it is mailed to the Board. A United States Postal Service postmark shall be prima facie evidence that the document with which it is associated was mailed on the date of the postmark.

(ii) Facsimile transmissions to the Board and the parties are permitted. The filing of a document by facsimile transmission occurs upon receipt by the Board of the entire submission by facsimile. Parties are specifically cautioned that a deadline for filing will not be extended merely because the Board's facsimile machine is busy or otherwise unavailable when a filing is due. Parties are expected to submit their facsimile machine numbers with their filings.

(iii) Filings submitted by electronic mail (e-mail) are permitted, with the exception of appeal files submitted pursuant to 6101.4 (Rule 4), classified documents, and filings submitted *in camera* or under protective order pursuant to 6101.9(c) (Rule 9(c)).

All e-mail filings received by 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, on a working day will be considered to be filed on that day. E-mail filings received after that time will be considered to be filed on the next working day.

(10) *Working hours.* The Board's working hours are 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, on each working day.

(c) *Construction.* The rules of this chapter shall be construed to secure the just, informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of every case. The Board looks to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for guidance in construing those Board rules which are similar to Federal Rules.

(d) *Rulings, orders, and directions.* The Board may apply the rules of this chapter and make such rulings and issue such orders and directions as are necessary to secure the just, informal, expeditious, and inexpensive resolution of every case before the Board.

In making rulings and issuing orders and directions pursuant to the rules of this chapter, the Board takes into consideration those Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which address matters not specifically covered herein.

(e) *Panels.* Each case will be assigned to a panel consisting of three judges, with one member designated as the presiding judge, in accordance with such procedures as may be established by the Board. The presiding judge is responsible for processing the case, including scheduling and conducting proceedings and hearings. In addition, the presiding judge may, without participation by other panel members, decide an appeal under the small claims procedure in 6101.52 [Rule 52], rule on nondispositive motions (except for amounts in controversy under 6101.52(a)(2) [Rule 52(a)(2)] and 6101.53(a)(2) [Rule 53(a)(2)]), and dismiss a case as permitted by 6101.12(e) [Rule 12(e)]). All other matters, except for those before the full Board under 6101.28 [Rule 28], are decided for the Board by a majority of the panel.
