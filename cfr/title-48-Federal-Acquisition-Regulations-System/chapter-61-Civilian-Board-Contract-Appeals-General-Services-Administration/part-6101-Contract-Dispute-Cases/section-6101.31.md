##### 6101.31 Payment of Board awards [Rule 31]. #####

(a) *Generally.* When permitted by law, payment of Board awards may be made in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1304. Awards by the Board pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act shall be directly payable by the respondent agency over which the applicant has prevailed in the underlying appeal.

(b) *Conditions for payment.* Before a party may obtain payment of a Board award pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 1304, one of the following must occur:

(1) Both parties must, by execution of a Certificate of Finality, waive their rights to relief under 6101.26 and 6101.27 (Rules 26 and 27) and also their rights to appeal the decision of the Board; or

(2) The time for filing an appeal must expire.

(c) *Procedure.* Whenever the Board issues a decision or an order awarding an appellant any amount of money, it will attach to the copy of the decision sent to each party forms such as those contained in the appendix to the rules of this chapter. Unless the appellant files a timely appeal from the decision, the appellant will complete the Certificate of Finality, sign it, and forward it to the person or persons who entered an appearance in the appeal on behalf of the respondent. Upon receipt of a completed and executed Certificate of Finality, unless the respondent files a timely appeal from the decision, the person or persons who entered an appearance in the appeal on behalf of the respondent will promptly transmit the appellant's Certificate of Finality, along with a certified copy of the Board's decision and any other necessary documentation, to the United States Department of the Treasury for payment.
