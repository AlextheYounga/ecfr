##### 6101.17 Exhibits [Rule 17]. #####

(a) *Marking of exhibits.* (1) Documents and other tangible things offered in evidence by a party will be marked for identification by the Board during the hearing or, if ordered by the Board, will be added to the appeal file as exhibits before the commencement of the hearing in order, for example, to eliminate the introduction of additional exhibits at the hearing.

(2) If a party elects to proceed on the record without a hearing pursuant to 6101.19 (Rule 19), documentary evidence submitted by that party will be numbered consecutively as appeal file exhibits.

(b) *Copies as exhibits.* Except upon objection sustained by the Board for good cause shown, copies of documents may be offered and received into evidence as exhibits, provided they are of equal legibility and quality as the originals, and such copies shall have the same force and effect as if they were the originals. If the Board directs, a party offering a copy of a document as an exhibit shall have the original available at the hearing for examination by the Board and any other party. When the original of a document has been received into evidence as an exhibit, an accurate copy may be substituted in evidence for the original by leave of the Board at any time. The Board may require a party to provide either copies of electronically stored information or printed versions of electronically stored information to be included in the record.

(c) *Withdrawal of exhibits and other items.* With the permission of the Board, a party that submits an exhibit or any other item may withdraw the exhibit or item from the record during the course of a proceeding.

(d) *Disposition of physical exhibits.* Any physical (as opposed to documentary) exhibit may be disposed of by the Board at any time more than 90 calendar days after the expiration of the period for appeal from the decision of the Board.
