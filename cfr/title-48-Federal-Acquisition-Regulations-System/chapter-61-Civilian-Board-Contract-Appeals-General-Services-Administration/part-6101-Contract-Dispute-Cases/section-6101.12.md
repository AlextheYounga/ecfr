##### 6101.12 Suspensions and dismissals [Rule 12]. #####

(a) *Suspension of proceedings to obtain contracting officer's decision.* The Board may in its discretion suspend proceedings to permit a contracting officer to issue a decision when an appeal has been taken from the contracting officer's alleged failure to render a timely decision.

(b) *Suspension for other cause.* The Board may suspend proceedings in a case for good cause, such as to permit the parties to finalize a settlement. The order suspending proceedings will prescribe the duration of the suspension or the conditions on which it will expire. The order may also prescribe actions to be taken by the parties during the period of suspension or following its expiration.

(c) *Dismissal, generally.* A case may be dismissed by the Board on motion of either party. A case may also be dismissed for reasons cited by the Board in a show cause order to which a response has been permitted. Every dismissal shall be with prejudice to reinstatement of the case except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section.

(d) *Dismissal without prejudice.* When circumstances beyond the control of the Board prevent the continuation of proceedings in a case, the Board may, in lieu of issuing an order suspending proceedings, dismiss the case without prejudice to reinstatement within 180 calendar days after the date of the dismissal. When a case has been dismissed without prejudice and neither party has timely requested that the case be reinstated, the case shall be deemed to be dismissed with prejudice on the last day such a request could have been made.

(e) *Issuance of order.* The presiding judge alone may issue an order suspending proceedings. An order of dismissal shall be issued by the panel of judges to which the case has been assigned if the motion is contested or if the Board is acting consequent to its own show cause order. An order of dismissal may be issued by the presiding judge alone if the motion to dismiss is not contested.
