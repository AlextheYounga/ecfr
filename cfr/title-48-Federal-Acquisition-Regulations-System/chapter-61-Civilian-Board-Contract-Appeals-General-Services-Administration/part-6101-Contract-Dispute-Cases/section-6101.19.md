##### 6101.19 Submission on the record without a hearing [Rule 19]. #####

(a) *Submission on the record.* A party may elect to submit its case on the record without a hearing. A party submitting its case on the record may include in its written record submission or submissions:

(1) Any relevant documents or other tangible things it wishes the Board to admit into evidence;

(2) Affidavits, depositions, and other discovery materials that set forth relevant evidence; and

(3) A brief or memorandum of law. The Board may require the submission of additional evidence or briefs and may order oral argument in a case submitted on the record.

(b) *Time for submission.* (1) If both parties have elected to submit the case on the record, the Board will issue an order prescribing the time for initial and, if appropriate, reply record submissions.

(2) If one party has elected a hearing and the other party has elected to submit its case on the record, the party submitting on the record shall make its initial submission no later than the commencement of the hearing or at an earlier date if the Board so orders, and a further submission in the form of a brief at the time for submission of posthearing briefs.

(c) *Objections to evidence.* Unless otherwise directed by the Board, objections to evidence (other than the appeal file and supplements thereto) in a record submission may be made within 10 working days after the filing of the submission, and replies to such objections, if any, may be made within 10 working days after the filing of the objection. The Board may rule on such objections either before it issues its decision or at the time it issues its decision.
