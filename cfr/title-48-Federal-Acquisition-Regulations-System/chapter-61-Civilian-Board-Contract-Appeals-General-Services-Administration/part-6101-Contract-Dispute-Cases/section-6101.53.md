##### 6101.53 Accelerated procedure [Rule 53]. #####

(a) *Election.* (1) The accelerated procedure is available solely at the appellant's election, and only when there is a monetary amount in dispute and that amount is $100,000 or less. Such election shall be made no later than 30 calendar days after the appellant's receipt of the agency answer, unless the presiding judge enlarges the time for good cause shown.

(2) At the request of the respondent, or on its own initiative, the Board may determine whether the amount in dispute is greater than $100,000, such that the election is inappropriate. The respondent shall raise any objection to the election no later than 10 working days after receipt of a notice of election.

(b) *Decision.* Each decision shall be rendered by the presiding judge with the concurrence of one of the other judges assigned to the panel; in the event the two judges disagree, the third judge assigned to the panel will participate in the decision.

(c) *Procedure.* Promptly after receipt of the appellant's election of the accelerated procedure, the Board shall establish a schedule of proceedings that will allow for the timely resolution of the appeal. Pleadings may be simplified, and discovery and other prehearing activities may be restricted or eliminated.

(d) *Time of decision.* Whenever possible, the Board shall resolve an appeal under this procedure within 180 calendar days from the Board's receipt of the election. The time for processing an appeal under this procedure may be extended if the appellant has not adhered to the established schedule. Either party's failure to abide by the Board's schedule may result in the Board drawing evidentiary inferences adverse to the party at fault.
