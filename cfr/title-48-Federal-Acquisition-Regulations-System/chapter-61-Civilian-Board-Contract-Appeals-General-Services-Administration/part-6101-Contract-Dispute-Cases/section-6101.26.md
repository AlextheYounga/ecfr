##### 6101.26 Reconsideration; amendment of decisions; new hearings [Rule 26]. #####

(a) *Grounds.* Reconsideration may be granted, a decision or order may be altered or amended, or a new hearing may be granted, for any of the reasons stated in 6101.27(a) (Rule 27(a)) and the reasons established by the rules of common law or equity applicable as between private parties in the courts of the United States. Reconsideration or a new hearing may be granted on all or any of the issues. Arguments already made and reinterpretations of old evidence are not sufficient grounds for granting reconsideration, for altering or amending a decision, or for granting a new hearing. Upon granting a motion for a new hearing, the Board will take additional testimony and, if a decision has been issued, either amend its findings of fact and conclusions or law or issue a new decision.

(b) *Procedure.* Any motion under 6101.26 (Rule 26) shall comply with the provisions of 6101.8 (Rule 8) and shall set forth:

(1) The reason or reasons why the Board should consider the motion; and

(2) The relief sought and the grounds therefor. If the Board concludes that the reasons asserted for its consideration of the motion are insufficient, it may deny the motion without considering the relief sought and the grounds asserted therefor. If the Board grants the motion, it will issue an appropriate order which may include directions to the parties for further proceedings.

(c) *Time for filing.* In an appeal or petition, a motion for reconsideration, to alter or amend a decision or order, or for a new hearing shall be filed within 30 calendar days after the date the moving party receives the decision or order. In an application, such a motion shall be filed within 7 working days after the date the moving party receives the decision or order. Not later than 30 calendar days after issuance of a decision or order, the Board may, on its own initiative, order reconsideration or a new hearing or alter or amend a decision or order for any reason that would justify such action on motion of a party.

(d) *Effect of motion.* A motion pending under 6101.26 (Rule 26) does not affect the finality of a decision or suspend its operation.
