Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 13115, Mar. 27, 2018.

Insert the clause at 1852.216-80, Task Ordering Procedure, in solicitations and contracts when an indefinite-delivery, task order contract is contemplated. The clause is applicable to both fixed-price and cost-reimbursement type contracts. If the contract does not require 533M reporting (See NPR 9501.2, NASA Contractor Financial Management Reporting System), use the clause with its Alternate I.
