Limitation on Subcontracting—STTR Program (OCT 2006)

The Contractor shall perform a minimum of 40 percent of the work under this contract (total contract price including cost sharing if any, less profit if any). A minimum of 30 percent of the work under this contract shall be performed by the research institution. Since the selection of R&D contractors is substantially based on the best scientific and technological sources, it is important that the Contractor not subcontract technical or scientific work without the Contracting Officer's advance approval.
