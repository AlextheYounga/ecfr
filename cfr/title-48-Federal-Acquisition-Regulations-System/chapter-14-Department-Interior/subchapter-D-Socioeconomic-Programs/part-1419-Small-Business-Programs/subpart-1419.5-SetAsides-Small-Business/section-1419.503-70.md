##### 1419.503-70 Class set-aside for construction acquisitions. #####

(a) Acquisitions for construction (as defined in FAR 2.101) estimated to cost $2 million or less shall be set-aside on a class basis for exclusive participation by small business concerns. This class set-aside does not apply when:

(1) The acquisition is procured using simplified acquisition procedures;

(2) Use of a set-aside is precluded by the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program (SBCDP) (See FAR 19.10);

(3) A non-competitive acquisition has been approved under the procedures of FAR 6.3;

(4) Work is to be performed outside the U.S.; or

(5) The BPC determines that adequate competition is not likely to be obtained if the acquisition is restricted to small business concerns, applying the requirements of FAR 19.202-2.

(b) The use of such set-asides is contingent upon current policy in effect under application of the SBCDP (See FAR 19.10).
