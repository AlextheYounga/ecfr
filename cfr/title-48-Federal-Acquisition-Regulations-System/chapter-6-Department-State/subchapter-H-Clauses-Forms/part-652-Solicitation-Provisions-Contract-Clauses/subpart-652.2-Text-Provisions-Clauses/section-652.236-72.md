Statement of Qualifications for Purposes of Determining Status as a U.S. Person (22 U.S.C. 4852)

Name and address of U.S. person organization providing this information:

*Introduction.* Section 402 of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act (Public Law 99-399) provides that a “United States person” or a “qualified United States joint venture” must meet certain requirements, listed in sections 402(c)(2) and (3) of the Act, to be eligible to compete. To assist business entities to determine whether they qualify as a U.S. person or U.S. joint venture person, guidance is hereby provided. For ease of reference, the statutory language is quoted immediately before the definitions that apply to it. Space for the required information is provided immediately following each definition.

Note:

The Statement of Qualifications shall provide information correctly applicable to the U.S. person whose qualifications are being certified, and shall not include information pertaining to corporate affiliates or subsidiaries. Organizations that wish to use the experience or financial resources of any other legally dependent organization or individual, including parent companies, subsidiaries, or other related organizations, must do so by way of a joint venture. A prospective bidder/offeror may be an individual organization or firm, a formal joint venture in which the co-venturers have reduced their arrangement to writing, or a de facto joint venture where no formal agreement has been reached, but the offering entity relies upon the experience of a related U.S. firm that guarantees performance. To be considered a “qualified United States joint venture person,” the joint venture must have at least one firm or organization that itself meets all the requirements of a U.S. person listed in Section 402. By signing this bid/proposal, the U.S. person co-venturer agrees to be individually responsible for performance of the contract, notwithstanding the terms of any joint venture agreement.

A natural person who is a United States citizen acting in his or her entrepreneurial capacity will be deemed to be a “person legally organized” within the scope of this definition, provided that the prospective bidder/offeror holds all required licenses to do business in the jurisdiction where he or she is located.

*Value* means the total contract price of the project, not to the profit or loss to the bidder/offeror.

*Within the United States* means a United States jurisdiction that is the place where the subject matter of the contract or other arrangement was in fact completed.
