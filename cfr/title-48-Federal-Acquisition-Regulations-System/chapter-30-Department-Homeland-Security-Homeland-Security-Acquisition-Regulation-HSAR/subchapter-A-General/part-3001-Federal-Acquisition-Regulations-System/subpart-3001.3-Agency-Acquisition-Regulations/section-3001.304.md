Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 17314, Apr. 2, 2021.

(a) The HSAR is under the direct oversight and control of the Department of Homeland Security, Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO), which is responsible for evaluation, review, and issuance of all Department-wide acquisition regulations and guidance. Each HCA may supplement the HSAR with Component guidance. Supplementation should be kept to a minimum. Components proposing to issue regulatory supplements or use solicitation or contract clauses on a repetitive basis must obtain legal review by the Component's legal counsel and forward supplements to the CPO for concurrence prior to publication in the Federal Register.

(c) The CPO is responsible for evaluating all regulatory coverage in agency acquisition regulations to determine if the substance could apply to other agencies and to make recommendation for inclusion in the FAR.
