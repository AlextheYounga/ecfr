Pursuant to the Foreign Affairs Manual, 12 FAM 540 (*http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/88404.pdf*), USAID applies the safeguards applicable to “Confidential” information to administratively controlled information designated as “Sensitive But Unclassified”.

(a) This clause applies to the extent that this contract involves access to classified (`Confidential', `Secret', or `Top Secret'), or administratively controlled (`Sensitive But Unclassified') information.
