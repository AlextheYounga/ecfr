As prescribed in AIDAR 704.1303, insert the following clause in Section I of solicitations and contracts:

Access to USAID Facilities and USAID's Information Systems (May 2024)

(a) The Contractor must ensure that individuals engaged in the performance of this award as employees or volunteers of the Contractor, or as subcontractors or subcontractor employees at any tier, comply with all applicable personal identity verification (PIV) and Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) procedures, including those summarized below, and any subsequent USAID or Government-wide procedures and policies related to PIV or HSPD-12.

(b) An individual engaged in the performance of this award may obtain access to USAID facilities or logical access to USAID's information systems only when and to the extent necessary to carry out this award. USAID issues various types of credentials to users who require physical access to Agency facilities and/or logical access to Agency information systems, in accordance with USAID's Automated Directives System (ADS) 542, available at *https://www.usaid.gov/about-us/agency-policy/series-500/542.*

(c) (1) No later than five (5) business days after award, unless the Contracting Officer authorizes a longer time period, the Contractor must provide to the Contracting Officer's Representative a complete list of individuals that require access to USAID facilities or information systems under this contract.

(2) Before an individual may obtain a USAID credential (new or replacement) authorizing the individual routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must physically present two forms of identity source documents in original form to the Enrollment Office personnel when undergoing processing. To obtain a PIV card, one identity source document must be a valid Federal or State Government-issued picture ID from the I-9 list available at *https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-acceptable-documents.* For other types of credentials the Contractor can obtain the list of acceptable forms from the Contracting Officer's Representative. Submission of these documents, as well as documentation of any applicable security background investigation, is mandatory in order for the individual to receive a credential granting facilities and/or logical access.

(d) (1) No later than the 5th day of each month, the Contractor must provide the Contracting Officer's Representative with the following:

(i) a list of individuals with access who were separated in the past sixty (60) calendar days, and

(ii) a list of individuals hired in the past sixty (60) calendar days who require access under this contract.

(2) This information must be submitted even if no separations or hiring occurred during the past sixty (60) calendar days.

(3) Failure to comply with the requirements in paragraph (d)(1) may result in the suspension of all facilities and/or logical access associated with this contract.

(e) The Contractor must ensure that individuals do not share logical access to USAID information systems and sensitive information.

(f) USAID may suspend or terminate the access to any systems and/or facilities in the event of any violation, abuse, or misuse. The suspension or termination may last until the situation has been corrected or no longer exists.

(g) The Contractor must notify the Contracting Officer's Representative and the USAID Service Desk (*CIO-HELPDESK@usaid.gov* or 202-712-1234) at least five (5) business days prior to the removal of any individuals with credentials from the contract. For unplanned terminations, the Contractor must immediately notify the Contracting Officer's Representative and the USAID Service Desk. Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor must return all credentials and remote authentication tokens to the Contracting Officer's Representative prior to departure of the individual or upon completion or termination of the contract, whichever occurs first.

(h) The Contractor must insert this clause, including this paragraph (h), in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or a subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID facilities or logical access to USAID's information systems. The Contractor is responsible for providing the Contracting Officer's Representative with the information required under paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(1) of this clause for any applicable subcontractor or subcontractor employee.
