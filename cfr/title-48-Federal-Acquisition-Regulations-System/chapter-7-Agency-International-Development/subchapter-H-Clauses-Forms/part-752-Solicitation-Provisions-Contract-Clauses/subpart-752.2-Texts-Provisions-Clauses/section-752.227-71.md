As prescribed in AIDAR 727.7003, insert the following clause in Section H of solicitations and contracts:

Planning, Collection, and Submission of Digital Information to USAID (JUN 2024)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*Computer* is a fixed or mobile device that accepts digital data and manipulates the information based on a program or sequence of instructions for how data is to be processed.

*Data* means recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which it may be recorded. The term includes technical data and computer software. The term does not include information incidental to contract administration, such as financial, administrative, cost or pricing, or management information.

*Data asset* is a collection of data elements or data sets that may be grouped together.

*Data inventory* is the first component of a Data Management Plan (DMP). The data inventory is a list of high-value data assets that the contractor anticipates producing during the period of award performance.

*Data management plan (DMP)* is a tool that guides the identification of anticipated data assets and outlines tasks needed to manage these assets across a full data lifecycle.

*Data set* is an organized collection of structured data, including data contained in spreadsheets, whether presented in tabular or non-tabular form. For example, a data set may represent a single spreadsheet, an extensible mark-up language (XML) file, a geospatial data file, or an organized collection of these. A data set does not include unstructured data, such as email or instant messages, PDF files, PowerPoint presentations, word processing documents, images, audio files, or collaboration software.

*Digital* means the coding scheme generally used in computer technology to represent data.

*Digital data* means quantitative and qualitative programmatic measurements that are entered directly into a computer. Examples include numeric targets established during activity design or implementation; baseline, mid-line, or final measurements created or obtained via field assessments; surveys or interviews; performance monitoring indicators as specified in the Contractor's approved AMELP; evaluation results; or perception metrics collected from beneficiaries on the quality and relevance of International Disaster Assistance and Development Assistance.

*Digital information* is a subset of data and means:

(i) Digital text;

(ii) Digital data;

(iii) Digital objects; and

(iv) Metadata created or obtained with USAID funding regarding international development or humanitarian assistance activities supported by this award that are represented, stored, or transmitted in such a way that they are available to a computer program.

*Digital method* is a means of using computer technology to gather, process, analyze, transmit, store, or otherwise use data and other forms of information.

*Digital object* includes digital or computer files that are available to a computer program. Examples include digital word processing or PDF documents or forms related to activity design, assessment reports, periodic progress and performance reports, academic research documents, publication manuscripts, evaluations, technical documentation and reports, and other reports, articles and papers prepared by the Contractor under this contract, whether published or not. Other examples include data sets, spreadsheets, presentations, publication-quality images, audio and video files, communication materials, information products, extensible mark-up language (XML) files, and software, scripts, source code, and algorithms that can be processed by a computer program.

*Digital repository* refers to information systems that ingest, store, manage, preserve, and provide access to digital content.

*Digital text* includes text-based descriptions of programmatic efforts that are entered directly into a computer, rather than submitted as a digital object.

*Draft digital information* refers to digital information that, in the professional opinion of the Contractor, does not adhere to the information quality standards such that it presents preliminary, unverified, incomplete, or deliberative findings, claims, analysis, or results that may lead the consumer of such material to draw erroneous conclusions.

*Granularity* refers to the extent to which digital content or objects provide access to detailed, distinct data points. Coarse granularity generally means that distinct data points reflect larger, representational units or have been joined together or aggregated, thus providing less detail. A fine level of granularity generally means that distinct data points reflect smaller, individualized units that have not been aggregated, thus providing a higher level of detail. For example, a data set containing a list of every activity conducted by week would generally exhibit a finer level of granularity than a data set listing the various categories of activities conducted by month. The degree of granularity can be relative to the contents of a specific data set and can be geographic, temporal, or across other dimensions.

*Information quality standards* means the elements of utility, objectivity, and integrity collectively.

*Integrity* is an element of the information quality standards that means information has been protected from unauthorized access or revision, to ensure that the information is not compromised through corruption or falsification.

*Machine readable* means data in a format that can be easily processed by a computer without human intervention while ensuring that no semantic meaning is lost.

*Metadata* includes structural or descriptive information about digital data or digital objects such as content, format, source, rights, accuracy, provenance, frequency, periodicity, granularity, publisher or responsible party, contact information, method of collection, and other descriptions.

*Objectivity* is an element of the information quality standards that means whether information is accurate, reliable, and unbiased as a matter of presentation and substance.

*Personally identifiable information (PII)* means information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual. [See Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-130, Managing Federal Information as a Strategic Resource.] PII can include both direct identifiers (such as name, health identification numbers, etc.), and indirect identifiers (geographic location, age) that when linked with other information can result in the identification of an individual.

*Publication object* is a digital object that has been accepted for publication prior to the end date of this contract and whose content is based on or includes any other digital information created or obtained in performance of this contract. In the research community, a publication object is often synonymous with a quality research manuscript that has been accepted by an academic journal for publication. However, publication objects can also consist of other digital objects (*e.g.,* photos, videos, etc.) published via news media, the internet, or other venues.

*Quality digital information* means digital information that, in the professional opinion of the Contractor, adheres to the information quality standards and presents reasonably sound and substantiated findings, claims, analysis, or results regarding activities.

*Registered with the USAID Digital Front Door (DFD)* means: that—

(i) The Contractor entered all mandatory information required to obtain access to the DFD.

(ii) The Contractor agrees to abide by the DFD terms and conditions of use.

(iii) The Government has validated the Contractor's registration by providing access to the DFD.

*USAID Digital Front Door (DFD),* located at *dfd.usaid.gov* is a website where the Contractor transacts business with USAID, such as submitting digital information.

*Utility* is an element of the information quality standards that means whether information is useful to its intended users, including the general public, and for its intended purpose.

(b) *Digital information planning requirements.* The Contractor must engage in digital information planning to ensure compliance with the collection and submission of all digital information, as required under this award.

(ii) Upon written approval of the contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative, the Contractor must submit draft digital information to USAID when the “best available” information is required in order to meet time constraints or other programmatic or operational exigencies.

(4) *Exemptions.* (i) The Contractor must not submit digital information through the DFD that contains:

(A) Classified information.

(B) Personally identifiable information. The Contractor must, to the maximum extent possible, remove the association between the set of identifying data and the individual to which it applies unless retaining such information is essential to comply with the terms of this contract and upon written approval from the contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative to submit this information.

(ii) If the Contractor believes there is a compelling reason not to submit specific digital information that does not fall under an exemption in this section, including circumstances where submission may jeopardize the personal safety of any individual or group, the Contractor must obtain written approval not to submit the digital information from the contracting officer.

(5) *Approval requirements.* Upon receipt of digital information submitted by the Contractor, the contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative will either approve or reject the submission. When a submission is rejected, the Contractor must make corrections and resubmit the required information. USAID does not consider the submission accepted until the contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative provides written approval to the Contractor.

(g) *Publication considerations.* (1) If the Contractor produces a publication object, the Contractor must submit via the DFD a copy of the publication object, the publication acceptance notification, along with a link at which the final published object may be accessed.

(2) For any digital object the Contractor submits in compliance with the terms of this contract, the Contractor may request from the contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative an embargo on the public release of the digital object. The contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative may approve an embargo request that is for no more than 12 months at a time, with additional scrutiny for digital objects relied upon for journal publication. A determination on this request will be provided to the Contractor in writing.

(3) If the Contractor used a digital object previously submitted via the DFD to generate the publication object, and that digital object is governed by a pre-existing embargo, that embargo will expire on the day the publication object is scheduled for publication. USAID may elect to publish digital information on which the publication object is based as early as the date the publication object is scheduled for publication.

(h) *USAID digital collection and submission standards.* The Contractor must comply with the version of USAID's Digital Collection and Submission Standards in effect on the date of award as outlined at *data.usaid.gov/standards.* If the Contractor is unable to adhere to USAID's Digital Collection and Submission Standards, the Contractor must obtain USAID's written approval for an alternative approach.

(i) *Access to the digital information.* USAID will conduct a rigorous risk assessment of digital information that the Contractor submits to USAID to determine the appropriate permissions and restrictions on access to the digital information. USAID may release the data publicly in full, redact or otherwise protect aspects of the information prior to public release, or hold the information in a non-public status.

(j) *Obligations regarding subcontractors.* (1) The Contractor must furnish, acquire, or collect information and submit to USAID, in accordance with paragraph (f) of this clause, all digital information produced, furnished, acquired, or collected in performance of this contract by its subcontractors at any tier.
