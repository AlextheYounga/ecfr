*Indicator* means a quantifiable measure of a characteristic or condition of people, institutions, systems, or processes that might change over time.

*Learning activity* means efforts for the purpose of generating, synthesizing, sharing, and applying evidence and knowledge.

*Monitoring context* means the systematic collection of information about conditions and external factors relevant to implementation and performance of the contract.

*Output* means the tangible, immediate, and intended products or consequences of contract implementation within the Contractor's control or influence.

*Outcome* means the conditions of people, systems, or institutions that indicate progress or lack of progress toward the achievement of the goals and objectives of the contract.

*Performance indicator means* an indicator that measures expected outputs and/or outcomes of the contract implementation.

*Target* means a specific, planned level of results to achieve within a specific timeframe with a given level of resources.

(b) *Requirements.* (1) Unless otherwise specified in the schedule of the contract, the Contractor must develop and submit a proposed AMELP to the contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative within ninety (90) days of contract award. The contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative will review and provide comments within thirty (30) days after receiving the proposed AMELP. The Contractor must submit a final AMELP for contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative approval no later than 15 days after receiving comments.

(2) The Contractor must revise the AMELP as necessary during the period of performance of this contract. Any revisions to the plan must be approved by the contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative.

(i) The Contractor's plan for monitoring, including any existing systems or processes for monitoring progress, any Standard Foreign Assistance Indicators as agreed upon by the contracting officer or delegated contracting officer's representative, any other USAID required indicators, and other relevant performance indicators of the contract's outputs and outcomes, their baseline (or plan for collecting baseline), and targets; and

(ii) The Contractor's plan for regular and systematic collection of feedback from beneficiaries, responding to feedback received, and reporting to USAID a summary of feedback and actions taken in response to the feedback received, or a rationale for why collecting feedback from beneficiaries is not applicable for this contract.

(2) The Contractor's proposed AMELP must be appropriate to the size and complexity of the contract and address the following, as applicable:

(i) Plans for monitoring context and emerging risks that could affect the achievement of the contract's results;

(ii) Plans for any evaluations to be conducted by the contractor, sub-contractor or third-party, including collaboration with an external evaluator;
