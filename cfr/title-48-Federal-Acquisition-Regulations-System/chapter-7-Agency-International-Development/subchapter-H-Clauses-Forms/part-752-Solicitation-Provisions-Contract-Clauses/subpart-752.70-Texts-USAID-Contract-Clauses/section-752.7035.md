Public Notices (DEC 1991)

It is USAID's policy to inform the public as fully as possible of its programs and activities. The contractor is encouraged to give public notice of the receipt of this contract and, from time to time, to announce progress and accomplishments. Press releases or other public notices should include a statement substantially as follows: “The U.S. Agency for International Development administers the U.S. foreign assistance program providing economic and humanitarian assistance in more than 80 countries worldwide.” The contractor may call on USAID's Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) for advice regarding public Notices. The contractor is requested to provide copies of notices or announcements to the contracting officer's representative and to USAID's Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) as far in advance of release as possible.
