(c) *Procedure to register for notifications.* Go to: *https://sites.google.com/site/usaidipnforacquisitions/* and click the “Register” button at the top of the page. Contractor representatives must use their official organization email address when subscribing, not personal email addresses.

(d) *Processing of IPN portal modifications.* (1) The contractor may access the IPN Portal at any time to review all IPN Portal modifications; however, the system will also notify the contractor by email when the USAID IPN Portal Administrator uploads a universal bilateral modification for contractor review and signature.

*Note to paragraph (d)(2)(i):* The contractor must not incorporate any other changes to the IPN Portal modification.

(iii) Notify the contracting officer that the contractor declines to sign the modification.
