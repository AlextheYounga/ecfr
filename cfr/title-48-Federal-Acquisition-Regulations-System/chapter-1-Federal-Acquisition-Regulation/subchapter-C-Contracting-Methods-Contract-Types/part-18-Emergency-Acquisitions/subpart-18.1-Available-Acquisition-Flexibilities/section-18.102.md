##### 18.102 System for award management. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 48697, Sept. 26, 2018.

Contractors are not required to be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database for contracts awarded to support unusual and compelling needs or emergency acquisitions. (See 4.1102). However, contractors are required to register with SAM in order to gain access to the Disaster Response Registry. Contracting officers shall consult the Disaster Response Registry via *https://www.acquisition.gov* to determine the availability of contractors for debris removal, distribution of supplies, reconstruction, and other disaster or emergency relief activities inside the United States and outlying areas. (See 26.205).
