##### 49.604 Release of excess funds under terminated contracts. #####

The following format shall be used to recommend the release of excess funds under terminated contracts, except if the contracting office retains responsibility for settlement of the termination:

FROM: Termination Contracting Officer \_\_\_\_\_\_ [address]TO: Contracting office \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ [address]SUBJ: Terminated Contract No. \_\_\_\_ with \_\_\_\_ [Contractor]Refs:

(a) [*Cite termination notice and effective date.*]

(b) [*Cite prior letters releasing excess funds, if any.*]

1. Referenced termination notice, \_\_\_\_\_\_ [*insert* “completely” *or* “partially”] terminated contract \_\_\_\_\_\_.

2. Based on the best information available, it is estimated that the gross settlement cost will be $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The amount available for release as excess to the contract is $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Any payments previously made to the Contractor for terminated items have been considered in arriving at the above amounts.

[*If prior letters recommending release of excess funds are cited, use the following as paragraph 2:*

“The estimated settlement costs previously reported by reference (b) in the amount of $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ are revised. On the best evidence now available, it is estimated that the settlement costs will be $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. The additional amount available for release is $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”.]

3. The related appropriations and amounts involved are:
