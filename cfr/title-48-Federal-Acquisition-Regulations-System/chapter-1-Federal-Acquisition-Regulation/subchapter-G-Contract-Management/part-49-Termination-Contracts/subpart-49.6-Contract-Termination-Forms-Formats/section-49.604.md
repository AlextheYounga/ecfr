(a) [*Cite termination notice and effective date.*]

(b) [*Cite prior letters releasing excess funds, if any.*]

1. Referenced termination notice, \_\_\_ [*insert* “completely” *or* “partially”] terminated contract \_\_\_.

“The estimated settlement costs previously reported by reference (b) in the amount of $\_\_\_\_\_\_ are revised. On the best evidence now available, it is estimated that the settlement costs will be $\_\_\_\_\_\_. The additional amount available for release is $\_\_\_\_\_\_”.]
