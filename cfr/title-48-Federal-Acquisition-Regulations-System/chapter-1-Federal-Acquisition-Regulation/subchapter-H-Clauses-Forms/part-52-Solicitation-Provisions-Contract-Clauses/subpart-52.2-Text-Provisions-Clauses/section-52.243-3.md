(7) Amount of Government-furnished property.

(b) If any change causes an increase or decrease in any hourly rate, the ceiling price, or the time required for performance of any part of the work under this contract, whether or not changed by the order, or otherwise affects any other terms and conditions of this contract, the Contracting Officer will make an equitable adjustment in any one or more of the following and will modify the contract accordingly:

(1) Ceiling price.

(2) Hourly rates.

(3) Delivery schedule.

(4) Other affected terms.

(c) The Contractor shall assert its right to an adjustment under this clause within 30 days from the date of receipt of the written order.
