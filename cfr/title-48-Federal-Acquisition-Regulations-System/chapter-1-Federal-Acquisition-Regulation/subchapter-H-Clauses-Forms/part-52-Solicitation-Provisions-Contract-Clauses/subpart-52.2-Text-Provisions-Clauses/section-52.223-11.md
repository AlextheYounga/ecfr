Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 30248, Apr. 22, 2024.

As prescribed in in 23.804(a)(1), insert the following clause:

Ozone-Depleting Substances and High Global Warming Potential Hydrofluorocarbons (JUN 2016)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*Global warming potential* means how much a given mass of a chemical contributes to global warming over a given time period compared to the same mass of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide's global warming potential is defined as 1.0.

*High global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons* means any hydrofluorocarbons in a particular end use for which EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program has identified other acceptable alternatives that have lower global warming potential. The SNAP list of alternatives is found at 40 CFR part 82, subpart G, with supplemental tables of alternatives available at (*http://www.epa.gov/snap/*).

*Hydrofluorocarbons* means compounds that only contain hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon.

*Ozone-depleting substance* means any substance the Environmental Protection Agency designates in 40 CFR part 82 as—

(1) Class I, including, but not limited to, chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform; or

(2) Class II, including, but not limited to, hydrochlorofluorocarbons.

(b) The Contractor shall label products that contain or are manufactured with ozone-depleting substances in the manner and to the extent required by 42 U.S.C. 7671j (b), (c), (d), and (e) and 40 CFR part 82, subpart E, as follows:

Warning: Contains (or manufactured with, if applicable) \*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, a substance(s) which harm(s) public health and environment by destroying ozone in the upper atmosphere.

\* The Contractor shall insert the name of the substance(s).

(c) *Reporting.* For equipment and appliances that normally each contain 50 or more pounds of hydrofluorocarbons or refrigerant blends containing hydrofluorocarbons, the Contractor shall—

(1) Track on an annual basis, between October 1 and September 30, the amount in pounds of hydrofluorocarbons or refrigerant blends containing hydrofluorocarbons contained in the equipment and appliances delivered to the Government under this contract by—

(i) Type of hydrofluorocarbon (*e.g.,* HFC-134a, HFC-125, R-410A, R-404A, etc.);

(ii) Contract number; and

(iii) Equipment/appliance;

(2) Report that information to the Contracting Officer for FY16 and to *www.sam.gov,* for FY17 and after—

(i) Annually by November 30 of each year during contract performance; and

(ii) At the end of contract performance.

(d) The Contractor shall refer to EPA's SNAP program (available at *http://www.epa.gov/snap*) to identify alternatives. The SNAP list of alternatives is found at 40 CFR part 82, subpart G, with supplemental tables available at *http://www.epa.gov/snap.*
