As prescribed in in 23.109(d)(1), insert the following clause:

Ozone-Depleting Substances and High Global Warming Potential Hydrofluorocarbons (MAY 2024)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*Global warming potential* means how much a given mass of a chemical contributes to global warming over a given time period compared to the same mass of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide's global warming potential is defined as 1.0.

*High global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons* means any hydrofluorocarbons in a particular end use for which EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program has identified other acceptable alternatives that have lower global warming potential. The SNAP list of alternatives is found at 40 CFR part 82, subpart G, with supplemental tables of alternatives available at (*https://www.epa.gov/snap/*).

*Hydrofluorocarbons* means compounds that only contain hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon.

*Ozone-depleting substance* means any substance the Environmental Protection Agency designates in 40 CFR part 82 as—

(1) Class I, including, but not limited to, chlorofluorocarbons, halons, carbon tetrachloride, and methyl chloroform; or

(2) Class II, including, but not limited to, hydrochlorofluorocarbons.

(b) The Contractor shall label products that contain or are manufactured with ozone-depleting substances in the manner and to the extent required by 42 U.S.C. 7671j (b), (c), (d), and (e) and 40 CFR part 82, subpart E, as follows:

Warning: Contains (or manufactured with, if applicable) \*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, a substance(s) which harm(s) public health and environment by destroying ozone in the upper atmosphere.

\* The Contractor shall insert the name of the substance(s).

(c) The Contractor shall refer to EPA's SNAP program to identify alternatives. The SNAP list of alternatives is found at 40 CFR part 82, subpart G, with supplemental tables available at *https://www.epa.gov/snap/.*
