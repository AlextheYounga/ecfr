The Government shall not be responsible for the condition of, or any loss or damage to, the property.

(c) The Contractor shall promptly remove from the site all property acquired by the Contractor. The Government will not permit storage of property on the site beyond the completion date.

As a condition of the granting of this permission, the Contractor agrees to waive any right, title, claim, or interest in and to the property.
