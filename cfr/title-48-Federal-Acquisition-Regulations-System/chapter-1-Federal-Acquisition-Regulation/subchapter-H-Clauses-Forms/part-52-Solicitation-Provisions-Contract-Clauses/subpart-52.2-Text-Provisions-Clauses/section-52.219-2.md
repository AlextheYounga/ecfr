##### 52.219-2 Equal Low Bids. #####

As prescribed in 19.309(b), insert the following provision:

Equal Low Bids (OCT 1995)

(a) This provision applies to small business concerns only.

(b) The bidder's status as a labor surplus area (LSA) concern may affect entitlement to award in case of tie bids. If the bidder wishes to be considered for this priority, the bidder must identify, in the following space, the LSA in which the costs to be incurred on account of manufacturing or production (by the bidder or the first-tier subcontractors) amount to more than 50 percent of the contract price.

(c) Failure to identify the labor surplus areas as specified in paragraph (b) of this provision will preclude the bidder from receiving priority consideration. If the bidder is awarded a contract as a result of receiving priority consideration under this provision and would not have otherwise received award, the bidder shall perform the contract or cause the contract to be performed in accordance with the obligations of an LSA concern.
