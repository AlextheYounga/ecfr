##### 52.219-10 Incentive Subcontracting Program. #####

As prescribed in 19.708(c)(1), insert the following clause:

Incentive Subcontracting Program (OCT 2014)

(a) Of the total dollars it plans to spend under subcontracts, the Contractor has committed itself in its subcontracting plan to try to award certain percentages to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns, respectively.

(b) If the Contractor exceeds its subcontracting goals for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns in performing this contract, it will receive \_\_ [*Contracting Officer to insert the appropriate number between 0 and 10*] percent of the dollars in excess of each goal in the plan, unless the Contracting Officer determines that the excess was not due to the Contractor's efforts (e.g., a subcontractor cost overrun caused the actual subcontract amount to exceed that estimated in the subcontracting plan, or the award of subcontracts that had been planned but had not been disclosed in the subcontracting plan during contract negotiations). Determinations under this paragraph are unilateral decisions made solely at the discretion of the Government.

(c) If this is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, the sum of the fixed fee and the incentive fee earned under this contract may not exceed the limitations in 15.404-4 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
