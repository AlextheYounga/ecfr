(i) *Recordkeeping.* (1) The Contractor shall make and maintain, for no less than three (3) years from the completion of the work on the contract, records containing the following information for each employee, which the Contractor shall make available upon request for inspection, copying, and transcription by authorized representatives of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor:

(2)(i) If the Contractor wishes to distinguish between an employee's covered and noncovered work, the Contractor shall keep records or other proof reflecting such distinctions. Only if the Contractor adequately segregates the employee's time will time spent on noncovered work be excluded from hours worked counted toward the accrual of paid sick leave. Similarly, only if the Contractor adequately segregates the employee's time may the Contractor properly refuse an employee's request to use paid sick leave on the ground that the employee was scheduled to perform noncovered work during the time he or she asked to use paid sick leave.

(ii) If the Contractor estimates covered hours worked by an employee who performs work in connection with contracts covered by the E.O. pursuant to 29 CFR 13.5(a)(1)(i) or (iii), the Contractor shall keep records or other proof of the verifiable information on which such estimates are reasonably based. Only if the Contractor relies on an estimate that is reasonable and based on verifiable information will an employee's time spent in connection with noncovered work be excluded from hours worked counted toward the accrual of paid sick leave. If the Contractor estimates the amount of time an employee spends performing in connection with contracts covered by the E.O., the Contractor shall permit the employee to use his or her paid sick leave during any work time for the Contractor.

(3) In the event the Contractor is not obligated by the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, or the Fair Labor Standards Act to keep records of an employee's hours worked, such as because the employee is exempt from the Fair Labor Standards Act's minimum wage and overtime requirements, and the Contractor chooses to use the assumption permitted by 29 CFR 13.5(a)(1)(iii), the Contractor is excused from the requirement in paragraph (i)(1)(iv) of this clause and 29 CFR 13.25(a)(4) to keep records of the employee's number of daily and weekly hours worked.

(4)(i) Records relating to medical histories or domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking, created for purposes of E.O. 13706, whether of an employee or an employee's child, parent, spouse, domestic partner, or other individual related by blood or affinity whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship, shall be maintained as confidential records in separate files/records from the usual personnel files.

(ii) If the confidentiality requirements of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA), section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) apply to records or documents created to comply with the recordkeeping requirements in this contract clause, the records and documents shall also be maintained in compliance with the confidentiality requirements of the GINA, section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and/or ADA as described in 29 CFR 1635.9, 41 CFR 60-741.23(d), and 29 CFR 1630.14(c)(1), respectively.

(iii) The Contractor shall not disclose any documentation used to verify the need to use 3 or more consecutive days of paid sick leave for the purposes listed in 29 CFR 13.5(c)(1)(iv) (as described in 29 CFR 13.5(e)(1)(ii)) and shall maintain confidentiality about any domestic abuse, sexual assault, or stalking, unless the employee consents or when disclosure is required by law.

(5) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours.

(6) Nothing in this contract clause limits or otherwise modifies the Contractor's recordkeeping obligations, if any, under the Service Contract Labor Standards statute, the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, E.O. 13658, their respective implementing regulations, or any other applicable law.

(j) *Interference/discrimination.* (1) The Contractor shall not in any manner interfere with an employee's accrual or use of paid sick leave as required by E.O. 13706 or 29 CFR part 13. Interference includes, but is not limited to -

(i) Miscalculating the amount of paid sick leave an employee has accrued;

(ii) Denying or unreasonably delaying a response to a proper request to use paid sick leave;

(iii) Discouraging an employee from using paid sick leave;

(iv) Reducing an employee's accrued paid sick leave by more than the amount of such leave used;

(v) Transferring an employee to work on contracts not covered by the E.O. to prevent the accrual or use of paid sick leave;

(vi) Disclosing confidential information contained in certification or other documentation provided to verify the need to use paid sick leave; or

(vii) Making the use of paid sick leave contingent on the employee's finding a replacement worker or the fulfillment of the Contractor's operational needs.

(2) The Contractor shall not discharge or in any other manner discriminate against any employee for -

(i) Using, or attempting to use, paid sick leave as provided for under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR part 13;

(ii) Filing any complaint, initiating any proceeding, or otherwise asserting any right or claim under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR part 13;

(iii) Cooperating in any investigation or testifying in any proceeding under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR part 13; or

(iv) Informing any other person about his or her rights under E.O. 13706 and 29 CFR part 13.

(k) *Notice.* The Contractor shall notify all employees performing work on or in connection with a contract covered by the E.O. of the paid sick leave requirements of E.O. 13706, 29 CFR part 13, and this clause by posting a notice provided by the Department of Labor in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite so it may be readily seen by employees. Contractors that customarily post notices to employees electronically may post the notice electronically, provided such electronic posting is displayed prominently on any Web site that is maintained by the Contractor, whether external or internal, and customarily used for notices to employees about terms and conditions of employment.

(l) *Disputes concerning labor standards.* Disputes related to the application of E.O. 13706 to this contract shall not be subject to the general disputes clause of the contract. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of the Department of Labor set forth in 29 CFR part 13. Disputes within the meaning of this contract clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives.

(m) *Subcontracts.* The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (m), in all subcontracts, regardless of dollar value, that are subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards statute or the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) statute, and are to be performed in whole or in part in the United States.
