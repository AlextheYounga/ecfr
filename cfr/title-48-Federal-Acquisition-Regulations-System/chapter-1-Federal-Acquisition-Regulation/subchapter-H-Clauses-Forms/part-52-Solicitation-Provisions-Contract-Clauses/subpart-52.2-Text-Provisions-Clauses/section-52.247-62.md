##### 52.247-62 Specific Quantities Unknown. #####

As prescribed in 47.305-16(d)(2), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts when total requirements and destinations to which shipments will be made are known, but the specific quantity to be shipped to each destination cannot be predetermined. This clause protects the interests of both the Government and the contractor during the course of the performance of the contract.

Specific Quantities Unknown (APR 1984)

(a) For the purpose of evaluating *f.o.b. destination* offers, the Government estimates that the quantity specified will be shipped to the destinations indicated:

|Estimated quantity|Destination|   |
|------------------|-----------|---|
|                  |           |   |
|                  |           |   |
|                  |           |   |

(b) If the quantity shipped to each destination varies from the quantity estimated, and if the variation results in a change in the transportation costs, appropriate adjustment shall be made.
