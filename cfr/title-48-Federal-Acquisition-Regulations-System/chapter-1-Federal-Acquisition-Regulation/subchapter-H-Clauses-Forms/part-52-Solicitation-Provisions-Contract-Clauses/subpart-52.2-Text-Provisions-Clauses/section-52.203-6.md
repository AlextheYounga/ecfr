As prescribed in 3.503-2, insert the following clause:

Restrictions on Subcontractor Sales to the Government (SEP 2006)

(a) Except as provided in (b) below, the Contractor shall not enter into any agreement with an actual or prospective subcontractor, nor otherwise act in any manner, which has or may have the effect of restricting sales by such subcontractors directly to the Government of any item or process (including computer software) made or furnished by the subcontractor under this contract or under any follow-on production contract.

(b) The prohibition in (a) above does not preclude the Contractor from asserting rights that are otherwise authorized by law or regulation.

(c) The Contractor agrees to incorporate the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (c), in all subcontracts under this contract which exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.

(End of clause)

*Alternate I* (OCT 1995). As prescribed in 3.503-2, substitute the following paragraph in place of paragraph (b) of the basic clause:

(b) The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this clause does not preclude the Contractor from asserting rights that are otherwise authorized by law or regulation. For acquisitions of commercial items, the prohibition in paragraph (a) applies only to the extent that any agreement restricting sales by subcontractors results in the Federal Government being treated differently from any other prospective purchaser for the sale of the commercial item(s).
