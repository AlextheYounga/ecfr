(2) *Affiliates,* as used in paragraph (a)(1) of this clause, means business concerns, one of whom directly or indirectly controls or has the power to control the others, or a third party or parties control or have the power to control the others. In determining whether affiliation exists, consideration is given to all appropriate factors including common ownership, common management, and contractual relationships.

Offers received from concerns that do not qualify as small business concerns shall be considered nonresponsive and shall be rejected on the set-aside portion of the requirement.

(2) Small business concerns may submit offers and compete for the non-set-aside portion and the set-aside portion.

(d) The Offeror shall—

[*Contracting Officer check as appropriate.*]

\_\_ Submit a separate offer for each portion of the solicitation for which it wants to compete (*i.e.* set-aside portion, non-set-aside portion, or both); or

\_\_ Submit one offer to include all portions for which it wants to compete.

(e) *Partial set-asides of multiple-award contracts.* (1) Small business concerns will not compete against other than small business concerns for any order issued under the part or parts of the multiple-award contract that are set aside.

(2) Small business concerns may compete for orders issued under the part or parts of the multiple-award contract that are not set aside, if the small business concern received a contract award for the non-set-aside portion.
