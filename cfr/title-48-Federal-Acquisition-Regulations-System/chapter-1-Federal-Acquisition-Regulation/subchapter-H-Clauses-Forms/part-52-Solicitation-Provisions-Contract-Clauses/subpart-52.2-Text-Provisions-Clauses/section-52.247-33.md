##### 52.247-33 F.o.b. Origin, With Differentials. #####

As prescribed in 47.303-5(c), insert the following clause:

F.o.b. Origin, With Differentials (FEB 2006)

(a) The term *f.o.b. origin, with differentials,* as used in this clause, means—

(1) Free of expense to the Government delivered—

(i) On board the indicated type of conveyance of the carrier (or of the Government, if specified) at a designated point in the city, county, and State from which the shipments will be made and from which line-haul transportation service (as distinguished from switching, local drayage, or other terminal service) will begin;

(ii) To, and placed on, the carrier's wharf (at shipside, within reach of the ship's loading tackle, when the shipping point is within a port area having water transportation service) or the carrier's freight station;

(iii) To a U.S. Postal Service facility; or

(iv) If stated in the solicitation, to any Government-designated point located within the same city or commercial zone as the f.o.b. origin point specified in the contract (the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration prescribes commercial zones at Subpart B of 49 CFR part 372); and

(2) Differentials for mode of transportation, type of vehicle, or place of delivery as indicated in Contractor's offer may be added to the contract price.

(b) The Contractor shall—

(1)(i) Pack and mark the shipment to comply with contract specification; or

(ii) In the absence of specifications, prepare the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements to protect the goods and to ensure assessment of the lowest applicable transportation charge;

(2)(i) Order specified carrier equipment when requested by the Government; or

(ii) If not specified, order appropriate carrier equipment not in excess of capacity to accommodate shipment;

(3) Deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the carrier, and load, stow, trim, block, and/or brace carload or truckload shipment (when loaded by the Contractor) on or in the carrier's conveyance as required by carrier rules and regulations;

(4) Be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods—

(i) Occurring before delivery to the carrier;

(ii) Resulting from improper packing and marking; or

(iii) Resulting from improper loading, stowing, trimming, blocking, and/or bracing of the shipment, if loaded by the Contractor on or in the carrier's conveyance;

(5) Complete the Government bill of lading supplied by the ordering agency or, when a Government bill of lading is not supplied, prepare a commercial bill of lading or other transportation receipt. The bill of lading shall show—

(i) A description of the shipment in terms of the governing freight classification or tariff (or Government rate tender) under which lowest freight rates are applicable;

(ii) The seals affixed to the conveyance with their serial numbers or other identification;

(iii) Lengths and capacities of cars or trucks ordered and furnished;

(iv) Other pertinent information required to effect prompt delivery to the consignee, including name, delivery address, postal address and ZIP code of consignee, routing, etc.;

(v) Special instructions or annotations requested by the ordering agency for bills of lading; *e.g.*, “*This shipment is the property of, and the freight charges paid to the carrier will be reimbursed by, the Government*”; and

(vi) The signature of the carrier's agent and the date the shipment is received by carrier; and

(6) Distribute the copies of the bill of lading, or other transportation receipts, as directed by the ordering agency.

(c)(1) It may be advantageous to the offeror to submit f.o.b. origin prices that include only the lowest cost to the Contractor for loading of shipment at the Contractor's plant or most favorable shipping point. The cost beyond that plant or point of bringing the supplies to the place of delivery and the cost of loading, blocking, and bracing on the type vehicle specified by the Government at the time of shipment may exceed the offeror's lowest cost when the offeror ships for the offeror's account. Accordingly, the offeror may indicate differentials that may be added to the offered price. These differentials shall be expressed as a rate in cents for each 100 pounds (CWT) of the supplies for one or more of the options under this clause that the Government may specify at the time of shipment.

(2) These differential(s) will be considered in the evaluation of offers to determine the lowest overall cost to the Government. If, at the time of shipment, the Government specifies a mode of transportation, type of vehicle, or place of delivery for which the offeror has set forth a differential, the Contractor shall include the total of such differential costs (the applicable differential multiplied by the actual weight) as a separate reimbursable item on the Contractor's invoice for the supplies.

(3) The Government shall have the option of performing or arranging at its own expense any transportation from Contractor's shipping plant or point to carrier's facility at the time of shipment and, whenever this option is exercised, the Government shall make no reimbursement based on a quoted differential.

(4) Offeror's differentials in cents for each 100 pounds for optional mode of transportation, types of vehicle, transportation within a mode, or place of delivery, specified by the Government at the time of shipment and not included in the f.o.b. origin price indicated in the Schedule by the offeror, are as follows:
