System for Award Manangement (OCT 2016)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this provision -

*Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) indicator* means a four-character suffix to the unique entity identifier. The suffix is assigned at the discretion of the commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity to establish additional System for Award Management records for identifying alternative EFT accounts (see subpart 32.11) for the same entity.

*Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database* means that -

(1) The Offeror has entered all mandatory information, including the unique entity identifier and the EFT indicator, if applicable, the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14) into the SAM database;

(2) The offeror has completed the Core, Assertions, and Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;

(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The offeror will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and

(4) The Government has marked the record “Active”.

*Unique entity identifier* means a number or other identifier used to identify a specific commercial, nonprofit, or Government entity. See *www.sam.gov* for the designated entity for establishing unique entity identifiers.

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the Offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the SAM database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation.

(2) The Offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation “Unique Entity Identifier” followed by the unique entity identifier that identifies the Offeror's name and address exactly as stated in the offer. The Offeror also shall enter its EFT indicator, if applicable. The unique entity identifier will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the Offeror is registered in the SAM database.

(c) If the Offeror does not have a unique entity identifier, it should contact the entity designated at *www.sam.gov* for establishment of the unique entity identifier directly to obtain one. The Offeror should be prepared to provide the following information:

(1) Company legal business name.

(2) Tradestyle, doing business, or other name by which your entity is commonly recognized.

(6) Date the company was started.

(7) Number of employees at your location.

(8) Chief executive officer/key manager.

(9) Line of business (industry).

(10) Company headquarters name and address (reporting relationship within your entity).

(d) If the Offeror does not become registered in the SAM database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

(e) Processing time, which normally takes 48 hours, should be taken into consideration when registering. Offerors who are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation.

(f) Offerors may obtain information on registration at *https://www.acquisition.gov.*

*Alternate I* (JUL 2013). As prescribed in 4.1105(a)(2), substitute the following paragraph (b)(1) for paragraph (b)(1) of the basic provision:

(b)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the System for Award Management prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation. If registration prior to award is not possible, the awardee shall be registered in the System for Award Management within 30 days after award or before three days prior to submission of the first invoice, whichever occurs first.
