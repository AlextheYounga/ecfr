Registrations in SAM are required to be maintained current, accurate, and complete (see 52.204-13, System for Award Management Maintenance).

(2) The Contractor shall consider subcontractor labor law violation information when assessing whether a prospective subcontractor has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics with regard to compliance with labor laws, when determining subcontractor responsibility. Disclosure of labor law decision(s) does not automatically render the prospective subcontractor nonresponsible.

(*ii*) The subcontractor has entered into a labor compliance agreement(s) with an enforcement agency and states that it has not been notified by DOL that it is not complying with its agreement; or

(*iii*) The subcontractor has agreed to enter into a labor compliance agreement or is considering a labor compliance agreement(s) with an enforcement agency to address all disclosed labor law violations that DOL has determined to be serious, willful, repeated, and/or pervasive labor law violations and has not been notified by DOL that it has not entered into an agreement in a reasonable period; or

(*3*) The subcontractor disagrees with DOL's advice (e.g., that a proposed labor compliance agreement is warranted), or with DOL's notification that it has not entered into a labor compliance agreement in a reasonable period or is not complying with the agreement, and the subcontractor has provided the Contractor with -

If the information is current, accurate, and complete, no action is required. If the information is not current, accurate, and complete, subcontractors must provide revised information to DOL, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3)(iv) of this clause, and make a new representation and provide information to the Contractor pursuant to paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this clause to reflect any advice provided by DOL or other actions taken by the subcontractor.

(2) The Contractor shall further require the subcontractor to disclose during the course of performance of the subcontract any notification by DOL, within 5 business days of such notification, that it has not entered into a labor compliance agreement in a reasonable period or is not complying with a labor compliance agreement, and shall allow the subcontractor to provide an explanation and supporting information for the delay or non-compliance.

(3) The Contractor shall consider, in a timely manner, information obtained from subcontractors pursuant to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this clause, and determine whether action is necessary.

(4) If the Contractor has been informed by the subcontractor of DOL's assessment that the subcontractor has not demonstrated compliance with labor laws, and the Contractor decides to continue the subcontract, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer of its decision to continue the subcontract and provide the following information in writing:

Only DOL and enforcement agency representatives are available to consult with Contractors regarding subcontractor information. Contracting Officers or Agency Labor Compliance Advisors may assist with identifying the appropriate DOL and enforcement agency representatives.

(f) *Protections for subcontractor misrepresentations.* A contractor or subcontractor, acting in good faith, is not liable for misrepresentations made by its subcontractors about labor law decisions or about labor compliance agreements.
