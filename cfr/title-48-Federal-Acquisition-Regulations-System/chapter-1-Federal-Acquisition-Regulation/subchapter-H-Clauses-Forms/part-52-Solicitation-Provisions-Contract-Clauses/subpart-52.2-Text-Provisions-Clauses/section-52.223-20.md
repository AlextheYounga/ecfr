##### 52.223-20 Aerosols. #####

As prescribed in 23.804(a)(3), insert the following clause:

Aerosols (JUN 2016)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*Global warming potential* means how much a given mass of a chemical contributes to global warming over a given time period compared to the same mass of carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide's global warming potential is defined as 1.0.

*High global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons* means any hydrofluorocarbons in a particular end use for which EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy (SNAP) program has identified other acceptable alternatives that have lower global warming potential. The SNAP list of alternatives is found at 40 CFR part 82, subpart G, with supplemental tables of alternatives available at *http://www.epa.gov/snap/*).

*Hydrofluorocarbons* means compounds that contain only hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon.

(b) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor shall reduce its use, release, or emissions of high global warming potential hydrofluorocarbons, when feasible, from aerosol propellants or solvents under this contract. When determining feasibility of using a particular alternative, the Contractor shall consider environmental, technical, and economic factors such as—

(1) In-use emission rates, energy efficiency;

(2) Safety, such as flammability or toxicity;

(3) Ability to meet technical performance requirements; and

(4) Commercial availability at a reasonable cost.

(c) The Contractor shall refer to EPA's SNAP program to identify alternatives. The SNAP list of alternatives is found at 40 CFR part 82, subpart G, with supplemental tables available at *http://www.epa.gov/snap/.*
