As prescribed in 15.408(e), insert the following clause:

Subcontractor Certified Cost or Pricing Data - Modifications (JUN 2020)

(a) The requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this clause shall -

(1) Become operative only for any modification to this contract involving a pricing adjustment expected to exceed the threshold for submission of certified cost or pricing data in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.403-4(a)(1) on the date of execution of the modification; and

(2) Be limited to such modifications.

(b) Before awarding any subcontract expected to exceed the threshold for submission of certified cost or pricing data in FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), on the date of agreement on price or the date of award, whichever is later; or before pricing any subcontract modification involving a pricing adjustment expected to exceed the threshold for submission of certified cost or pricing data in FAR 15.403-4(a)(1), the Contractor shall require the subcontractor to submit certified cost or pricing data (actually or by specific identification in writing), in accordance with FAR 15.408, Table 15-2 (to include any information reasonably required to explain the subcontractor's estimating process such as the judgmental factors applied and the mathematical or other methods used in the estimate, including those used in projecting from known data, and the nature and amount of any contingencies included in the price), unless an exception under FAR 15.403-1(b) applies. If the threshold for submission of certified cost or pricing data specified in FAR 15.403-4(a)(1) is adjusted for inflation as set forth in FAR 1.109(a), then pursuant to FAR 1.109(d) the changed threshold applies throughout the remaining term of the contract, unless there is a subsequent threshold adjustment.

(c) The Contractor shall require the subcontractor to certify in substantially the form prescribed in FAR 15.406-2 that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the data submitted under paragraph (b) of this clause were accurate, complete, and current as of the date of agreement on the negotiated price of the subcontract or subcontract modification.

(d) The Contractor shall insert the substance of this clause, including this paragraph (d), in each subcontract that exceeds the threshold for submission of certified cost or pricing data in FAR 15.403-4(a)(1) on the date of agreement on price or the date of award, whichever is later.
