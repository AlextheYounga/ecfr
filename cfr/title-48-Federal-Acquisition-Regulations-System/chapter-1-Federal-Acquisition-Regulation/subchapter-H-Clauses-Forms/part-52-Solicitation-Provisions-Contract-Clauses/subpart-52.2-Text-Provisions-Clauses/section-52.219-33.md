##### 52.219-33 Nonmanufacturer Rule. #####

As prescribed in 19.507(h), insert the following clause:

Nonmanufacturer Rule (SEP 2021)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause—

*Manufacturer* means the concern that transforms raw materials, miscellaneous parts, or components into the end item. Concerns that only minimally alter the item being procured do not qualify as manufacturers of the end item. Concerns that add substances, parts, or components to an existing end item to modify its performance will not be considered the end item manufacturer, where those identical modifications can be performed by and are available from the manufacturer of the existing end item.

*Nonmanufacturer* means a concern, including a supplier, that provides an end item it did not manufacture, process, or produce.

(b) *Applicability.*

(1) This clause does not apply to contracts awarded pursuant to the unrestricted portion of a partial set-aside or to a contractor that is the manufacturer of the product or end item.

(2) This clause applies to—

(i) Contracts that have been awarded pursuant to a set-aside, in total or in part, for any of the small business concerns identified in 19.000(a)(3);

(ii) Contracts that have been awarded on a sole-source basis in accordance with subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15;

(iii) Orders expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold and that are—

(A) Set aside for small business under multiple-award contracts, as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F); or

(B) Issued directly to a small business concern under multiple-award contracts as described in 19.504(c)(1)(ii);

(iv) Orders, regardless of dollar value, that are—

(A) Set aside in accordance with subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15 under multiple-award contracts as described in 8.405-5 and 16.505(b)(2)(i)(F); or

(B) Issued directly to concerns that qualify for the programs described in subparts 19.8, 19.13, 19.14, and 19.15 under multiple-award contracts as described in 19.504(c)(1)(ii); and

(v) Contracts using the HUBZone price evaluation preference to award to a HUBZone concern unless the Contractor waived the evaluation preference.

(c) *Requirements.*

(1) The Contractor shall—

(i) Provide an end item that a small business has manufactured, processed, or produced in the United States or its outlying areas; for kit assemblers who are nonmanufacturers, see paragraph (c)(2) of this clause instead;

(ii) Be primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade and normally sell the type of item being supplied; and

(iii) Take ownership or possession of the item(s) with its personnel, equipment, or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practice; for example, providing storage, transportation, or delivery.

(2) When the end item being acquired is a kit of supplies, at least 50 percent of the total cost of the components of the kit shall be manufactured, processed, or produced in the United States or its outlying areas by small business concerns.
