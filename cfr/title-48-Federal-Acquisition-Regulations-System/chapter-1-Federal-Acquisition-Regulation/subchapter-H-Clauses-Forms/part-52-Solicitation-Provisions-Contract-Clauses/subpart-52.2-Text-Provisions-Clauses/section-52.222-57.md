(a)(1) *Definitions.*

*Administrative merits determination, arbitral award* or *decision, civil judgment*, *DOL Guidance, enforcement agency*, *labor compliance agreement, labor laws*, and *labor law decision* as used in this provision have the meaning given in the clause in this solicitation entitled 52.222-59, Compliance with Labor Laws (Executive Order 13673).

(2) *Joint ventures.* If the offeror is a joint venture that is not itself a separate legal entity, each concern participating in the joint venture shall separately comply with the requirements of this provision.

(2) For solicitations issued after April 24, 2017: The Offeror [ ] does [ ] does not anticipate submitting an offer with an estimated contract value of greater than $500,000.

(c) If the Offeror checked “does” in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this provision, the Offeror represents to the best of the Offeror's knowledge and belief [*Offeror to check appropriate block*]:

[ ](1) There has been no administrative merits determination, arbitral award or decision, or civil judgment for any labor law violation(s) rendered against the Offeror during the period beginning on October 25, 2015 to the date of the offer, or for three years preceding the date of the offer, whichever period is shorter; or

[ ](2) There has been an administrative merits determination, arbitral award or decision, or civil judgment for any labor law violation(s) rendered against the Offeror during the period beginning on October 25, 2015 to the date of the offer, or for three years preceding the date of the offer, whichever period is shorter.

(d)(1) If the box at paragraph (c)(2) of this provision is checked and the Contracting Officer has initiated a responsibility determination and has requested additional information, the Offeror shall provide -

(i) For each disclosed labor law decision in the System for Award Management (SAM) at *www.sam.gov*, the following, unless the information is already current, accurate, and complete in SAM. This information will be publicly available in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS):

(A) The labor law violated.

(B) The case number, inspection number, charge number, docket number, or other unique identification number.

(C) The date rendered.

(D) The name of the court, arbitrator(s), agency, board, or commission that rendered the determination or decision;

(ii) The administrative merits determination, arbitral award or decision, or civil judgment document to the Contracting Officer, if the Contracting Officer requires it;

(iii) In SAM, such additional information as the Offeror deems necessary to demonstrate its responsibility, including mitigating factors and remedial measures such as Offeror actions taken to address the violations, labor compliance agreements, and other steps taken to achieve compliance with labor laws. Offerors may provide explanatory text and upload documents. This information will not be made public unless the contractor determines that it wants the information to be made public; and

(iv) The information in paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(iii) of this provision to the Contracting Officer, if the Offeror meets an exception to SAM registration (see 4.1102(a)).

(2)(i) The Contracting Officer will consider all information provided under (d)(1) of this provision as part of making a responsibility determination.

(ii) A representation that any labor law decisions were rendered against the Offeror will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a representation or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.

(iii) The representation in paragraph (c) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous representation, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation in accordance with the procedures set forth in part 49.

(e) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if at any time prior to contract award the Offeror learns that its representation at paragraph (c) of this provision is no longer accurate.

(f) The representation in paragraph (c) of this provision will be public information in the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS).
