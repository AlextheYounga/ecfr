##### 25.504-2 WTO GPA/Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative/FTAs. #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 6188, Jan. 19, 2021.

*Example 1.*

|Offer A|304,000|      U.S.-made end product (not domestic).      |
|:------|------:|:------------------------------------------------|
|Offer B|303,000|U.S.-made end product (domestic), small business.|
|Offer C|300,000|                Eligible product.                |
|Offer D|295,000|      Noneligible product (not U.S.-made).       |

*Analysis:* Eliminate Offer D because the acquisition is covered by the WTO GPA and there is an offer of a U.S.-made or an eligible product (see 25.502(b)(1)). If the agency gives the same consideration given eligible offers to offers of U.S.-made end products that are not domestic offers, it is unnecessary to determine if U.S.-made end products are domestic (large or small business). No further analysis is necessary. Award on the low remaining offer, Offer C (see 25.502(b)(2)).
