##### 25.504-1 Buy American statute. #####

(a)(1) *Example 1.*

|Offer A|$12,000|        Domestic end product, small business.        |
|:------|------:|:----------------------------------------------------|
|Offer B|11,700 |        Domestic end product, small business.        |
|Offer C|10,000 |U.S.-made end product (not domestic), small business.|

(2) *Analysis:* This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Since the acquisition value is less than $25,000 and the acquisition is set aside, none of the trade agreements apply. Perform the steps in 25.502(a). Offer C is evaluated as a foreign end product because it is the product of a small business, but is not a domestic end product (see 25.502(c)(4)). Since Offer B is a domestic offer, apply the 12 percent factor to Offer C (see 25.105(b)(2)). The resulting evaluated price of $11,200 remains lower than Offer B. The cost of Offer B is therefore unreasonable (see 25.105(c)). Award on Offer C at $10,000 (see 25.502(c)(4)(i)).

(b)(1) *Example 2.*

|Offer A|$11,000|        Domestic end product, small business        |
|:------|------:|:---------------------------------------------------|
|Offer B|$10,700|        Domestic end product, small business        |
|Offer C|$10,200|U.S.-made end product (not domestic), small business|

(2) *Analysis:* This acquisition is for end products for use in the United States and is set aside for small business concerns. The Buy American statute applies. Perform the steps in 25.502(a). Offer C is evaluated as a foreign end product because it is the product of a small business but is not a domestic end product (see 25.502(c)(4)). After applying the 12 percent factor, the evaluated price of Offer C is $11,424. Award on Offer B at $10,700 (see 25.502(c)(4)(ii)).
