##### 25.504-4 Group award basis. #####

(a) *Example 1.*

|Item|   Offers   |            |             |
|----|------------|------------|-------------|
| A  |     B      |     C      |             |
| 1  |DO = $55,000|EL = $56,000|NEL = $50,000|
| 2  |NEL = 13,000|EL = 10,000 | EL = 13,000 |
| 3  |NEL = 11,500|DO = 12,000 | DO = 10,000 |
| 4  |NEL = 24,000|EL = 28,000 |NEL = 22,000 |
| 5  |DO = 18,000 |NEL = 10,000| DO = 14,000 |
|    |  121,500   |  116,000   |   109,000   |

Key: DO = Domestic end product; EL = Eligible product; NEL = Noneligible product.

*Problem:* Offeror C specifies all-or-none award. Assume all offerors are large businesses. The acquisition is not covered by the WTO GPA .

*Analysis:* (see 25.503)

*STEP 1:* Evaluate Offers A & B before considering Offer C and determine which offer has the lowest evaluated cost for each line item (the tentative award pattern):

*Item 1:* Low offer A is domestic; select A.

*Item 2:* Low offer B is eligible; do not apply factor; select B.

*Item 3:* Low offer A is noneligible and Offer B is a domestic offer. Apply a 6 percent factor to Offer A. The evaluated price of Offer A is higher than Offer B; select B.

*Item 4:* Low offer A is noneligible. Since neither offer is a domestic offer, no evaluation factor applies; select A.

*Item 5:* Low offer B is noneligible; apply a 6 percent factor to Offer B. Offer A is still higher than Offer B; select B.

*STEP 2:* Evaluate Offer C against the tentative award pattern for Offers A and B:

|  Item   |               Offers               |              |                |
|---------|------------------------------------|--------------|----------------|
|Low offer|Tentative award pattern from A and B|      C       |                |
|    1    |                 A                  | DO = $55,000 |\* NEL = $53,000|
|    2    |                 B                  | EL = 10,000  |  EL = 13,000   |
|    3    |                 B                  | DO = 12,000  |  DO = 10,000   |
|    4    |                 A                  | NEL = 24,000 |  NEL = 22,000  |
|    5    |                 B                  |\*NEL = 10,600|  DO = 14,000   |
|         |                                    |   111,600    |    112,000     |

\* Offer + 6 percent.

On a line item basis, apply a factor to any noneligible offer if the other offer for that line item is domestic.

For Item 1, apply a factor to Offer C because Offer A is domestic and the acquisition was not covered by the WTO GPA . The evaluated price of Offer C, Item 1, becomes $53,000 ($50,000 plus 6 percent). Apply a factor to Offer B, Item 5, because it is a noneligible product and Offer C is domestic. The evaluated price of Offer B is $10,600 ($10,000 plus 6 percent). Evaluate the remaining items without applying a factor.

*STEP 3:* The tentative unrestricted award pattern from Offers A and B is lower than the evaluated price of Offer C. Award the combination of Offers A and B. Note that if Offer C had not specified all-or-none award, award would be made on Offer C for line items 1, 3, and 4, totaling an award of $82,000.

(b) *Example 2.*

|Item|   Offers   |            |             |
|----|------------|------------|-------------|
| A  |     B      |     C      |             |
| 1  |DO = $50,000|EL = $50,500|NEL = $50,000|
| 2  |NEL = 10,300|NEL = 10,000| EL = 10,200 |
| 3  |EL = 20,400 |EL = 21,000 |NEL = 20,200 |
| 4  |DO = 10,500 |DO = 10,300 | DO = 10,400 |
|    |   91,200   |   91,800   |   90,800    |

*Problem:* The solicitation specifies award on a group basis. Assume the Buy American statute applies and the acquisition cannot be set aside for small business concerns. All offerors are large businesses.

*Analysis:* (see 25.503(c))

STEP 1: Determine which of the offers are domestic (see 25.503(c)(1)):

|   |Domestic  <br/>[percent]|Determination|
|---|------------------------|-------------|
| A | 60,500/91,200 = 66.3%  |  Domestic   |
| B | 10,300/91,800 = 11.2%  |   Foreign   |
| C | 10,400/90,800 = 11.5%  |   Foreign   |

*STEP 2:* Determine whether foreign offers are eligible or noneligible offers (see 25.503(c)(2)):

|   |Domestic + eligible  <br/>[percent]|Determination|
|---|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| A |                N/A                |  Domestic   |
| B |       81,800/91,800 = 89.1%       |  Eligible   |
| C |       20,600/90,800 = 22.7%       | Noneligible |

*STEP 3:* Determine whether to apply an evaluation factor (see 25.503(c)(3)). The low offer (Offer C) is a foreign offer. There is no eligible offer lower than the domestic offer. Therefore, apply the factor to the low offer. Addition of the 6 percent factor (use 12 percent if Offer A is a small business) to Offer C yields an evaluated price of $96,248 ($90,800 + 6 percent). Award on Offer A (see 25.502(c)(4)(ii)). Note that, if Offer A were greater than Offer B, an evaluation factor would not be applied and award would be on Offer C (see 25.502(c)(3)).
