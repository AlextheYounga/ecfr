##### 22.2006 Arbitration of contractor employee claims. #####

E.O. 13673 requires contractors, on contracts exceeding $1,000,000, to agree that the decision to arbitrate claims arising under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of sexual assault or harassment, be made only with the voluntary consent of employees or independent contractors after such disputes arise, subject to certain exceptions. This flows down to subcontracts exceeding $1,000,000 other than for the acquisition of commercial items.

Note to 22.2006:

By a court order issued on October 24, 2016, this section is enjoined indefinitely as of the date of the order. The enjoined section will become effective immediately if the court terminates the injunction. At that time, DoD, GSA, and NASA will publish a document in the Federal Register advising the public of the termination of the injunction.
