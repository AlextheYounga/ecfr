##### 22.2004-1 General. #####

(a) *Contracts.* An offeror on a solicitation estimated to exceed $500,000 must represent whether, in the past three years, any labor law decision(s), as defined at 22.2002, was rendered against it. If an offeror represents that a decision(s) was rendered against it, and if the contracting officer has initiated a responsibility determination, the contracting officer will require the offeror to submit information on the labor law decision(s) and afford the offeror an opportunity to provide such additional information as the prospective contractor deems necessary to demonstrate its responsibility including mitigating factors and remedial measures such as contractor actions taken to address the violations, labor compliance agreements, and other steps taken to achieve compliance with labor laws. The contractor must update the information semiannually in the System for Award Management (SAM). For further information, including about phase-ins, see the provisions and clauses prescribed at 22.2007(a) and (c).

(b) *Subcontracts.* Contractors are required to direct their prospective subcontractors to submit labor law decision information to DOL. Prospective subcontractors will also be afforded an opportunity to provide information to DOL on mitigating factors and remedial measures, such as subcontractor actions taken to address the violations, labor compliance agreements, and other steps taken to achieve compliance with labor laws. Contractors will consider DOL analysis and advice as they make responsibility determinations on their prospective subcontractors for subcontracts at any tier estimated to exceed $500,000, except for subcontracts for commercially available off-the-shelf items. Subcontractors must update the information semiannually. For further information, including about phase-ins, see the provision and clauses prescribed at 22.2007(b) and (c).

(c) *ALCA assistance.* The ALCA is responsible for accomplishing the specified objectives of the E.O., which include a number of overarching management functions. In addition, the ALCA provides support to the procurement process by -

(1) Encouraging prospective contractors and subcontractors that have labor law violations that may be serious, repeated, willful, and/or pervasive to work with enforcement agencies to discuss and address the labor law violations as soon as practicable;

(2) Providing input to the individual responsible for preparing and documenting past performance evaluations in Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS) (see 42.1502(j) and 42.1503) so that labor compliance may be considered during source selection;

(3) Providing written analysis and advice to the contracting officer for consideration in the responsibility determination and during contract performance (see 22.2004-2(b) and 22.2004-3(b)). The analysis requires obtaining labor law decision documents and, using DOL Guidance, assessing the labor law violations and information on mitigating factors and remedial measures, such as contractor actions taken to address the violations, labor compliance agreements, and other steps taken to achieve compliance with labor laws;

(4) Notifying, if appropriate, the agency suspending and debarring official, in accordance with agency procedures (see 9.406-3(a) and 9.407-3(a)), or advising that the contracting officer provide such notification;

(5) Monitoring SAM and FAPIIS for new and updated contractor disclosures of labor law decision information; and

(6) Making a notation in FAPIIS when the ALCA learns that a contractor has entered into a labor compliance agreement.
