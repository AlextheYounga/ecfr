##### 22.2003 Policy. #####

It is the policy of the Federal Government to promote economy and efficiency in procurement by awarding contracts to contractors that promote safe, healthy, fair, and effective workplaces through compliance with labor laws, and by promoting opportunities for contractors to do the same when awarding subcontracts. Contractors and subcontractors that consistently adhere to labor laws are more likely to have workplace practices that enhance productivity and increase the likelihood of timely, predictable, and satisfactory delivery of goods and services. This policy is supported by E.O. 13673, Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces.

Note to 22.2003:

By a court order issued on October 24, 2016, this section is enjoined indefinitely as of the date of the order. The enjoined section will become effective immediately if the court terminates the injunction. At that time, DoD, GSA, and NASA will publish a document in the Federal Register advising the public of the termination of the injunction.
