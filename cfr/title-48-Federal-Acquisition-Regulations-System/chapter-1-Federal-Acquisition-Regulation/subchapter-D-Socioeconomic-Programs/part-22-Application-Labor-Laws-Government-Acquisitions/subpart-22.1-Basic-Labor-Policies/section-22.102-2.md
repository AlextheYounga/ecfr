##### 22.102-2 Administration and enforcement. #####

(a) Agencies shall cooperate with, and encourage contractors to use to the fullest extent practicable, the DOL Employment and Training Administration (DOLETA) at *http://www.doleta.gov,* and its affiliated local offices in meeting contractors' labor requirements. These requirements may be to staff new or expanding plant facilities, including requirements for workers in all occupations and skills from local labor market areas or through the Federal-State employment clearance system.

(b) Local State employment offices are operated throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to providing recruitment assistance to contractors, cooperation with the local State Employment Service offices will further the national program of maintaining continuous assessment of manpower requirements and resources on a national and local basis.

(c)(1) The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. DOL's Wage and Hour Division is responsible for administration and enforcement of numerous wage and hour statutes including -

(i) 40 U.S.C. chapter 31, subchapter IV, Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) (see subpart 22.4);

(ii) 40 U.S.C. chapter 37, Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards (see subpart 22.3);

(iii) The Copeland Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 3145) (see 22.403-2);

(iv) 41 U.S.C. chapter 65, Contracts for Materials, Supplies, Articles, and Equipment Exceeding $15,000 (see subpart 22.6); and

(v) 41 U.S.C. chapter 67, Service Contract Labor Standards (see subpart 22.10).

(2) Contracting officers should contact the Wage and Hour Division's regional offices when required by the subparts relating to these statutes unless otherwise specified. Addresses for these offices may be found at Appendix B to 29 CFR Part 1.

(3) DOL's administration and enforcement authorities under the statutes and under the Executive orders implemented in this part do not limit the authority of contracting officers to administer and enforce the terms and conditions of agency contracts. However, DOL has regulatory authority to require contracting agencies to change contract terms to include missing contract clauses or wage determinations that are required by the FAR, or to withhold contract amounts (see, e.g., 22.1015, 22.1022).

Note to paragraph (c)(3):

By a court order issued on October 24, 2016, this paragraph (c)(3) is enjoined indefinitely as of the date of the order. The enjoined paragraph will become effective immediately if the court terminates the injunction. At that time, DoD, GSA, and NASA will publish a document in the Federal Register advising the public of the termination of the injunction.
