Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 47864, Sept. 10, 2019.

(a) Status as a HUBZone small business concern is determined by the Small Business Administration (SBA) in accordance with 13 CFR part 126.

(b) If the SBA determines that a concern is a HUBZone small business concern, it will issue a certification to that effect and will add the concern to the List of Qualified HUBZone Small Business Concerns at *http://dsbs.sba.gov/dsbs/search/dsp\_searchhubzone.cfm.* Only firms on the list are HUBZone small business concerns, eligible for HUBZone preferences. HUBZone preferences apply without regard to the place of performance. Information on HUBZone small business concerns can also be obtained at *http://www.sba.gov/hubzone* or by writing to the Director for the HUBZone Program (Director/HUB) at U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW., Washington, DC 20416 or at *hubzone@sba.gov.*

(c) A joint venture may be considered a HUBZone small business concern if it meets the criteria in the explanation of affiliates (*see* 19.101).

(d) To be eligible for a HUBZone contract under this section, a HUBZone small business concern must be a HUBZone small business concern both at the time of its initial offer and at the time of contract award.

(e) A HUBZone small business concern may submit an offer for supplies as a nonmanufacturer if it meets the requirements of the nonmanufacturer rule set forth at 13 CFR 121.406(b)(1) and if the small business manufacturer providing the end item is also a HUBZone small business concern.

(1) There are no waivers to the nonmanufacturer rule for HUBZone contracts.

(2) For HUBZone contracts at or below $25,000 in total value, a HUBZone small business concern may supply the end item of any manufacturer, including a large business, so long as the product acquired is manufactured or produced in the United States.
