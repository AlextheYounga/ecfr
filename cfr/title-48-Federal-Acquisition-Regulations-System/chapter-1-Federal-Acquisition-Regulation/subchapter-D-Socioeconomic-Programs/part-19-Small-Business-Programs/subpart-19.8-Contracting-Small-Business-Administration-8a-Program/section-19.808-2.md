##### 19.808-2 Competitive. #####

In competitive 8(a) acquisitions subject to part 15, the contracting officer conducts negotiations directly with the competing 8(a) participants. Conducting competitive negotiations among 8(a) participants prior to SBA's formal acceptance of the acquisition for the 8(a) program may be grounds for SBA's not accepting the acquisition for the 8(a) program.
