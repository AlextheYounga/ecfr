##### 19.804-4 Repetitive acquisitions. #####

In order for repetitive acquisitions to be awarded through the 8(a) Program, there must be separate offers and acceptances. This allows the SBA to determine -

(a) Whether the requirement should be a competitive 8(a) award;

(b) A nominated firm's eligibility, whether or not it is the same firm that performed the previous contract;

(c) The effect that contract award would have on the equitable distribution of 8(a) contracts; and

(d) Whether the requirement should continue under the 8(a) Program.
