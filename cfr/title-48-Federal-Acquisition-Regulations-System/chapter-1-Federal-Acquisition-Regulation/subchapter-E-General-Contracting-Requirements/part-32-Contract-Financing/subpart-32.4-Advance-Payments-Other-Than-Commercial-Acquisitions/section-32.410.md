[*Summarize the specific facts and significant circumstances concerning the contract and the contractor, that, together with the other findings, will clearly support the determination below.*]

(2) Advance payments (in an amount not to exceed $\_\_\_\_\_\_ at any time outstanding) (in an aggregate amount not exceeding $\_\_\_\_\_\_, less the aggregate amounts repaid, or withdrawn by the Government) are required by the Contractor to perform under the contract.

(3) The advance payments are necessary for prompt, efficient contract performance that will benefit the Government.

(4) The proposed advance payment clause provides for security for the protection of the Government.

[*Insert the following, if applicable* (The Contractor's financial management system provides for effective control over and accountability for all Federal funds under governing regulations of the Treasury Department.) (An advance payment bond is required.)] This security is considered adequate.

(5) Advance payments are the only adequate means of financing available to the Contractor, and the amount designated in (2) above is based, to the extent possible, on the use of the Contractor's own working capital in performing the contract.

[*Insert paragraph (6), (7), or (8), as applicable*].

(6) The Contractor is a nonprofit (educational) (and) (research) institution, and the contract is for (experimental) (,) (research and development) work.

Authorization

(c) The advance payments, of which (the amount at any time outstanding) (the aggregate amount, less the aggregate amounts repaid, or withdrawn by the Government), shall not exceed $\_\_\_\_, are hereby authorized under (41 U.S.C. chapter 45, Contract Financing) (10 U.S.C. chapter 277) (the Extraordinary Contracting Authority of Government Agencies in Connection with National Defense Functions (50 U.S.C. 1431-1435) and Executive Order No. 10789 of November 14, 1958 (3 CFR 1958 Supp. pp. 72-74)) [*or, if other, cite appropriate authority*] on (terms substantially as contained in the proposed advance payment clause, a copy (an outline) of which is annexed to this authorization) (the following terms:) [*Insert the appropriate terms.*]

[*Each Findings, Determination, and Authorization shall be individually prepared to fit the particular circumstances at hand. Subparagraphs (a)(1), (2), (3) and (4) and paragraphs (b) and (c) shall be used in each case. If the contract is (a) for experimental, developmental, or research work and with a nonprofit educational or research institution, or (b) only for management and operation of a Government-owned plant, subparagraph (a)(5) should not be included. If the advance payment is to be made without interest to the contractor, include subparagraph (a)(6), (7), or (8). If any advance payments have previously been authorized for the contract, include the final sentence of paragraph (c). The alternate parenthetical wording or other modifications may be used as appropriate. The paragraphs actually used shall be renumbered sequentially*].
