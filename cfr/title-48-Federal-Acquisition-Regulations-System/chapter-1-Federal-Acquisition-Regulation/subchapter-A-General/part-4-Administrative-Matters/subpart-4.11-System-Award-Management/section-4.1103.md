##### 4.1103 Procedures. #####

(a) Unless the acquisition is exempt under 4.1102, the contracting officer -

(1) Shall verify that the prospective contractor is registered in the SAM database (see paragraph (b) of this section) before awarding a contract or agreement. Contracting officers are encouraged to check the SAM early in the acquisition process, after the competitive range has been established, and then communicate to the unregistered offerors that they shall register;

(2) Should use the unique entity identifier to verify registration -

(i) Via the Internet at *https://www.acquisition.gov*; or

(ii) As otherwise provided by agency procedures; and

(3) Need not verify registration before placing an order or call if the contract or agreement includes the provision at 52.204-7, System for Award Management, or the clause at 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, or a similar agency clause, except when use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card is contemplated as a method of payment. (See 32.1108(b)(2)).

(b) If the contracting officer, when awarding a contract or agreement, determines that a prospective contractor is not registered in the SAM database and an exception to the registration requirements for the award does not apply (*see* 4.1102), the contracting officer shall -

(1) If the needs of the requiring activity allow for a delay, make award after the apparently successful offeror has registered in the SAM database. The contracting officer shall advise the offeror of the number of days it will be allowed to become registered. If the offeror does not become registered by the required date, the contracting officer shall award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror following the same procedures (*i.e.,* if the next apparently successful offeror is not registered, the contracting officer shall advise the offeror of the number of days it will be allowed to become registered, etc.); or

(2) If the needs of the requiring activity do not allow for a delay, proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered offeror, provided that written approval is obtained at one level above the contracting officer; or

(3) If the contract action is being awarded pursuant to 6.302-2, the contractor must be registered in the System for Award Management within 30 days after contract award, or at least three days prior to submission of the first invoice, whichever occurs first.

(c) Agencies shall protect against improper disclosure of contractor SAM information.

(d) The contracting officer shall, on contractual documents transmitted to the payment office, provide the unique entity identifier and, if applicable, the Electronic Funds Transfer indicator, in accordance with agency procedures.
