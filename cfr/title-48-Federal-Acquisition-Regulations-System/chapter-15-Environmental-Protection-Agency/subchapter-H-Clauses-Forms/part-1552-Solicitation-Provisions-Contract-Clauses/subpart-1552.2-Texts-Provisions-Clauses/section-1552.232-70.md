*Payment request* means any request for contract financing payment or invoice payment submitted by the Contractor under this contract.

(2)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this clause, the Contractor shall submit invoices using the electronic invoicing program Invoice Processing Platform (IPP), which is a secure web-based service provided by the U.S. Treasury that more efficiently manages government invoicing.

(ii) Under this contract, the following documents are required to be submitted as an attachment to the IPP invoice: (This is a fill-in for acceptable types of required documentation, such as an SF 1034 and 1035, or an invoice/self-designed form on company letterhead that contains the required information.)

(iv) Contractor assistance with enrollment can be obtained by contacting the IPP Production Helpdesk via email at *IPPCustomerSupport@fiscal.treasury.gov* or by telephone at (866) 973-3131.

(3) If the Contractor is unable to comply with the requirement to use IPP for submitting invoices for payment, the Contractor shall submit a waiver request in writing to the Contracting Officer. The Contractor may submit an invoice using other than IPP only when—

(i) The Contracting Officer administering the contract for payment has determined, in writing, that electronic submission would be unduly burdensome to the Contractor; and in such cases, the Contracting Officer shall modify the contract to include a copy of the Determination; or

(ii) When the Governmentwide commercial purchase card is used as the method of payment.

(d) *Subcontractor charges.* (1) The charges for subcontracts shall be further detailed in a supporting schedule showing the major cost elements for each subcontract.

(2) On a case-by-case basis, when needed to verify the reasonableness of subcontractor costs, the Contracting Officer may require that the contractor obtain from the subcontractor cost information in the detail set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. This information should be obtained through a means which maintains subcontractor confidentiality (for example, via sealed envelopes), if the subcontractor expresses Confidential Business Information (CBI) concerns.

Note to paragraph (j)

—Any costs requiring advance consent by the Contracting Officer will be considered improper and will be disallowed, if claimed prior to receipt of Contracting Officer consent. Include the total cost claimed for the current and cumulative-to-date periods. After the total amount claimed, provide summary dollar amounts disallowed on the contract as of the date of the invoice. Also include an explanation of the changes in cumulative costs disallowed by addressing each adjustment in terms of: Voucher number, date, dollar amount, source, and reason for the adjustment.

(k) *Adjustment vouchers.* Adjustment vouchers should be submitted if finalized indirect rates were received but the rates are not for the entire period of performance. For example, the base period of performance is for a calendar year but your indirect rates are by fiscal year. Hence, only part of the base period can be adjusted for the applicable final indirect rates. These invoices should be annotated with “adj” after the invoice number.

(l) *Final vouchers.* Final Vouchers shall be submitted if finalized rates have been received for the entire period of performance. For example, the base period of performance is for a calendar year but your indirect rates are by fiscal year. You have received finalized rates for the entire base period that encompass both fiscal years that cover the base period. In accordance with FAR 52.216-7, these invoices shall be submitted within 60 days after settlement of final indirect cost rates. They should be annotated with the word “Final” or “F” after the invoice number. Due to system limitations, the invoice number cannot be more than 11 characters to include spaces.

(m) *Completion vouchers.* In accordance with FAR 52.216-7(d)(5), a completion voucher shall be submitted within 120 days (or longer if approved in writing by the Contracting Officer) after settlement of the final annual indirect cost rates for all years of a physically complete contract. The voucher shall reflect the settled amounts and rates. It shall include settled subcontract amounts and rates. The prime contractor is responsible for settling subcontractor amounts and rates included in the completion invoice. Since EPA's invoices must be on a period of performance basis, the contractor shall have a completion invoice for each year of the period of performance. This voucher must be submitted to the Contracting Officer for review and approval before final payment can be made on the contract. The Contracting Officer may request an audit of the completion vouchers before final payment is made. In addition, once approved, the Contracting Officer will request the appropriate closeout paperwork for the contract. For contracts separately invoiced by delivery or task order, provide a schedule showing final total costs claimed by delivery or task order and in total for the contract. In addition to the completion voucher, the contractor must submit the *Contractor's Release; Assignee's Release,* if applicable; the *Contractor's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates, Credits and other Amounts;* the *Assignee's Assignment of Refunds, Rebates, Credits and other Amounts,* if applicable; and the *Contractor's Affidavit of Waiver of Lien,* when required by the contract.

*Alternate I* (MAY 2019) As prescribed in 1532.908, substitute the following paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) for paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) if used in a non-commercial time and materials type contract:

(c)(1) The Contractor shall prepare a contract level invoice or request for contract financing payment in accordance with the invoice preparation instructions. If contract work is authorized by individual task order or delivery order (TO/DO), the invoice or request for contract financing payment shall also include a summary of the current and cumulative amounts claimed by cost element for each TO/DO and for the contract total, as well as any supporting data for each TO/DO as identified in the instructions.

(2) The invoice or request for contract financing payment that employs a fixed rate feature shall include current and cumulative charges by contract labor category and by other major cost elements such as travel, equipment, and other direct costs. For current costs, each cost element shall include the appropriate supporting schedules identified in the invoice preparation instructions.
