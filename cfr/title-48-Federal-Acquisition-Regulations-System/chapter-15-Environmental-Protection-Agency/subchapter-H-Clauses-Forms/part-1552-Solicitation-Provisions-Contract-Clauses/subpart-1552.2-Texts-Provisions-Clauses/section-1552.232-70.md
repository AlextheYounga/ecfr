(2) The invoice or request for contract financing payment shall include current and cumulative charges by major cost element such as direct labor, overhead, travel, equipment, and other direct costs. For current costs, each major cost element shall include the appropriate supporting schedule identified in the invoice preparation instructions. Cumulative charges represent the net sum of current charges by cost element for the contract period.

(3) The charges for subcontracts shall be further detailed in a supporting schedule showing the major cost elements for each subcontract. The degree of detail for any subcontract exceeding $5,000 is to be the same as that set forth under (c)(2).

(2) If the Contracting Officer allows submissions more frequently than monthly, one submittal each month shall have the same ending period of performance as the monthly progress report.

(3) Where cumulative amounts on the monthly progress report differ from the aggregate amounts claimed in the invoice(s) or request(s) for contract financing payments covering the same period, the contractor shall provide a reconciliation of the difference as part of the payment request.
