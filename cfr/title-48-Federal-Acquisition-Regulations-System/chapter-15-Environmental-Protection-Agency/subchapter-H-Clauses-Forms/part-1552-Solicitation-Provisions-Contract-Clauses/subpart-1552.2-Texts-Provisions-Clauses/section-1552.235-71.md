(2) The Contractor shall obtain a written agreement to honor the above limitations from each of the Contractor's employees who will have access to the information before the employee is allowed access.

(3) The Contractor agrees that these contract conditions concerning the use and disclosure of confidential information are included for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, both EPA and any affected business having a proprietary interest in the information.

(4) The Contractor shall not use any confidential information supplied by EPA or obtained during performance hereunder to compete with any business to which the confidential information relates.

The Contractor agrees to include this clause, including this paragraph (b), in all subcontracts awarded, pursuant to this contract, that require the furnishing of confidential business information to the subcontractor.
