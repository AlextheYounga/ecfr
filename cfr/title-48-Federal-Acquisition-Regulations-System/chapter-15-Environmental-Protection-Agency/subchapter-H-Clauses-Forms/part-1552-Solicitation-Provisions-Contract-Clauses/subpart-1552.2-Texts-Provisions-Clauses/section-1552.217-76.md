##### 1552.217-76 Option to extend the effective period of the contract - indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 33021, July 19, 2017.

As prescribed in 1517.208(g), the following is used in indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity type contracts with options to extend the effective period of the contract. The clause may be adjusted depending upon the number of options. If only one option period is used, modify (b) and (c) accordingly.

Option To Extend the Effective Period of the Contract - Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity Contract

(a) The Government has the option to extend the effective period of this contract for \_\_ additional period(s). If more than sixty (60) days remain in the contract effective period, the Government, without prior written notification, may exercise this option by issuing a contract modification. To unilaterally exercise this option within the last 60 days of the effective period, the Government must issue written notification of its intent to exercise the option prior to that last 60-day period. This preliminary notification does not commit the Government to exercising the option.

(b) If the options are exercised, the “Minimum and Maximum Contract Amount” clause will be modified to reflect new and separate minimums of \_\_ for the first option period and \_\_ for the second option period, and new and separate maximums of \_\_ for the first option period and \_\_ for the second option period.

(c) The “Effective Period of the Contract” clause will be modified to cover a base period from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and option periods from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

(End of clause)
