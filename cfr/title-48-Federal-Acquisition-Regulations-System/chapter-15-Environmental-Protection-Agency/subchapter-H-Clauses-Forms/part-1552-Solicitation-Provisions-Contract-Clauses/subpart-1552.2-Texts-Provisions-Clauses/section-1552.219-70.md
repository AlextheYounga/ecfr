As prescribed in 1519.203(a), insert the following clause:

Mentor-Protégé Program (SEP 2017)

(a) The Contractor has been approved to participate in the EPA Mentor-Protégé Program. The purpose of the Program is to increase the participation of small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) as subcontractors, suppliers, and ultimately as prime contractors; establish a mutually beneficial relationship with SDBs and EPA's large business prime contractors (although small businesses may participate as Mentors); develop the technical and corporate administrative expertise of SDBs which will ultimately lead to greater success in competition for contract opportunities; promote the economic stability of SDBs; and aid in the achievement of goals for the use of SDBs in subcontracting activities under EPA contracts.

(b) The Contractor shall submit an executed Mentor-Protégé agreement to the Contracting Officer, with a copy to the Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) or the Small Business Specialist, within thirty (30) calendar days after the effective date of the contract. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within thirty (30) calendar days from its submission if the agreement is not accepted.

(c) The Contractor as a Mentor under the Program agrees to fulfill the terms of its agreement(s) with the Protégé firm(s).

(d) If the Contractor or Protégé firm is suspended or debarred while performing under an approved Mentor-Protégé agreement, the Contractor shall promptly give notice of the suspension or debarment to the OSDBU and the Contracting Officer.

(e) Costs incurred by the Contractor in fulfilling their agreement(s) with the Protégé firm(s) are not reimbursable on a direct basis under this contract.

(f) In an attachment to Individual Subcontract Reports (ISR), the Contractor shall report on the progress made under their Mentor-Protégé agreement(s), providing:

(1) The number of agreements in effect; and

(2) The progress in achieving the developmental assistance objectives under each agreement, including whether the objectives of the agreement have been met, problem areas encountered, and any other appropriate information.
