Option To Extend the Effective Period of the Contract—Time and Materials or Labor Hour Contract (APR 1984)

(a) The Government has the option to extend the effective period of this contract for \_\_\_\_ additional period(s). If more than sixty (60) days remain in the contract effective period, the Government, without prior written notification, may exercise this option by issuing a contract modification. To unilaterally exercise this option within the last 60 days of the effective period, the Government must issue written notification of its intent to exercise the option prior to that last 60-day period. This preliminary notification does not commit the Government to exercising the option.

(b) If the option(s) are exercised, the “Ceiling Price” clause will be modified to reflect a new and separate ceiling price of $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for the first option period and a new and separate ceiling price of $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for the second option period.

(c) The “Effective Period of the Contract” clause will be modified to cover a base period from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and option periods from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
