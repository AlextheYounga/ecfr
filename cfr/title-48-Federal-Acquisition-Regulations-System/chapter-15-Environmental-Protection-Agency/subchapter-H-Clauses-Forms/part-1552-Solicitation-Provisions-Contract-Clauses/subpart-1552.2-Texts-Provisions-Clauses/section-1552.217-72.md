Option To Extend the Term of the Contract—Cost-Plus-Award-Fee Contract (APR 1984)

(a) The Government has the option to extend the term of this contract for \_\_\_\_ additional periods. If more than 60 days remain in the contract period of performance, the Government, without prior written notification, may exercise this option by issuing a contract modification. To exercise this option within the last 60 days of the period of performance, the Government must provide to the Contractor written notification prior to that last 60-day period. This preliminary notification does not commit the Government to exercising the option. The Government's estimated level of effort is \_\_\_\_ direct labor hours for the first option period and \_\_\_\_ for the second. Use of an option will result in the following contract modifications:

(b) The “Period of Performance” clause will be amended to cover a base period from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and option periods from \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

(c) Paragraph (a) of the “Level of Effort” clause will be amended to reflect a new and separate level of effort of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for the first option period and a new and separate level of effort of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ for the second option period.

(d) The “Estimated Cost Base Fee and Award Fee” clause will be amended to reflect increased estimated costs and base fee and award fee pool for each option period as follows:

|              |Option 1|Option 2|
|--------------|--------|--------|
|Estimated cost|        |        |
|   Base fee   |        |        |
|Award fee pool|        |        |
|    Total     |        |        |

(e) If this contract contains “not to exceed amounts” for elements of other direct costs (ODC), those amounts will be increased as follows:

|Other direct cost item|Option 1|Option 2|
|----------------------|--------|--------|
|                      |        |        |
|                      |        |        |
|                      |        |        |
|                      |        |        |
