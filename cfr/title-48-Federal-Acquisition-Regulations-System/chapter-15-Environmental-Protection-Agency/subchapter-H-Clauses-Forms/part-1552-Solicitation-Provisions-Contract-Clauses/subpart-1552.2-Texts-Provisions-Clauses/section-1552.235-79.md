As prescribed in 1535.007-70(f), insert the following clause:

Release of Contractor Confidential Business Information (APR 1996)

(a) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may find it necessary to release information submitted by the Contractor either in response to this solicitation or pursuant to the provisions of this contract, to individuals not employed by EPA. Business information that is ordinarily entitled to confidential treatment under existing Agency regulations (40 CFR part 2) may be included in the information released to these individuals. Accordingly, by submission of this proposal or signature on this contract or other contracts, the Contractor hereby consents to a limited release of its confidential business information (CBI).

(b) Possible circumstances where the Agency may release the Contractor's CBI include, but are not limited to the following:

(1) To other Agency contractors tasked with assisting the Agency in the recovery of Federal funds expended pursuant to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 9607, as amended, (CERCLA or Superfund);

(2) To the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and contractors employed by DOJ for use in advising the Agency and representing the Agency in procedures for the recovery of Superfund expenditures;

(3) To parties liable, or potentially liable, for costs under CERCLA Sec. 107 (42 U.S.C. Sec. 9607), et al, and their insurers (Potentially Responsible Parties) for purposes of facilitating settlement or litigation of claims against such parties;

(4) To other Agency contractors who, for purposes of performing the work required under the respective contracts, require access to information the Agency obtained under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 *et seq.*); the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C.1251 *et seq.*); the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f *et seq.*); the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (7 U.S.C. 136 *et seq.*); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 *et seq.*); the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 *et seq.*); or the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 9601 *et seq.*);

(5) To other Agency contractors tasked with assisting the Agency in handling and processing information and documents in the administration of Agency contracts, such as providing both preaward and post award audit support and specialized technical support to the Agency's technical evaluation panels;

(6) To employees of grantees working at EPA under the Senior Environmental Employment (SEE) Program;

(7) To Speaker of the House, President of the Senate, or Chairman of a Committee or Subcommittee;

(8) To entities such as the General Accounting Office, boards of contract appeals, and the Courts in the resolution of solicitation or contract protests and disputes;

(9) To Agency contractor employees engaged in information systems analysis, development, operation, and maintenance, including performing data processing and management functions for the Agency; and

(10) Pursuant to a court order or court-supervised agreement.

(c) The Agency recognizes an obligation to protect the contractor from competitive harm that may result from the release of such information to a competitor. (See also the clauses in this document entitled “Screening Business Information for Claims of Confidentiality” and “Treatment of Confidential Business Information.”) Except where otherwise provided by law, the Agency will permit the release of CBI under subparagraphs (1), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (9) only pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.

(d) With respect to contractors, 1552.235-71 will be used as the confidentiality agreement. With respect to Potentially Responsible Parties, such confidentiality agreements may permit further disclosure to other entities where necessary to further settlement or litigation of claims under CERCLA. Such entities include, but are not limited to accounting firms and technical experts able to analyze the information, provided that they also agree to be bound by an appropriate confidentiality agreement.

(e) This clause does not authorize the Agency to release the Contractor's CBI to the public pursuant to a request filed under the Freedom of Information Act.

(f) The Contractor agrees to include this clause, including this paragraph (f), in all subcontracts at all levels awarded pursuant to this contract that require the furnishing of confidential business information by the subcontractor.
