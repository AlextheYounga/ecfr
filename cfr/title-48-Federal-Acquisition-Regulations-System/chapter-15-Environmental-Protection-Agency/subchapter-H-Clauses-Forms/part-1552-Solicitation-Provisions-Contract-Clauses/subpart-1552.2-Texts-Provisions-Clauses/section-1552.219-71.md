As prescribed in 1519.203(b), insert the following provision:

Procedures for Participation in the EPA Mentor-Protégé Program (JUL 2016)

(a) This provision sets forth the procedures for participation in the EPA Mentor-Protégé Program (hereafter referred to as the Program). The purpose of the Program is to increase the participation of concerns owned and/or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as subcontractors, suppliers, and ultimately as prime contractors; to establish a mutually beneficial relationship between these concerns and EPA's large business prime contractors (although small businesses may participate as Mentors); to develop the technical and corporate administrative expertise of these concerns, which will ultimately lead to greater success in competition for contract opportunities; to promote the economic stability of these concerns; and to aid in the achievement of goals for the use of these concerns in subcontracting activities under EPA contracts. If the successful offeror is accepted into the Program they shall serve as a Mentor to a Protégé firm(s), providing developmental assistance in accordance with an agreement with the Protégé firm(s).

(b) To participate as a Mentor, the offeror must receive approval in accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.

(c) A Protégé must be a concern owned and/or controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals within the meaning of section 8(a)(5) and (6) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)(5) and (6)), including historically black colleges and universities. Further, in accordance with Public Law 102-389 (the 1993 Appropriation Act), for EPA's contracting purposes, economically and socially disadvantaged individuals shall be deemed to include women.

(d) Where there may be a concern regarding the Protégé firm's eligibility to participate in the program, the protégé's eligibility will be determined by the contracting officer after the SBA has completed any formal determinations.

(e) The offeror shall submit an application in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section as part of its proposal which shall include as a minimum the following information.

(1) A statement and supporting documentation that the offeror is currently performing under at least one active Federal contract with an approved subcontracting plan and is eligible for the award of Federal contracts;

(2) A summary of the offeror's historical and recent activities and accomplishments under any disadvantaged subcontracting programs. The offeror is encouraged to include any initiatives or outreach information believed pertinent to approval as a Mentor firm;

(3) The total dollar amount (including the value of all option periods or quantities) of EPA contracts and subcontracts received by the offeror during its two preceding fiscal years. (Show prime contracts and subcontracts separately per year);

(4) The total dollar amount and percentage of subcontract awards made to all concerns owned and/or controlled by disadvantaged individuals under EPA contracts during its two preceding fiscal years.

(5) The number and total dollar amount of subcontract awards made to the identified Protégé firm(s) during the two preceding fiscal years (if any).

(f) In addition to the information required by paragraph (e) of this section, the offeror shall submit as a part of the application the following information for each proposed Mentor-Protégé relationship:

(1) Information on the offeror's ability to provide developmental assistance to the identified Protégé firm and how the assistance will potentially increase contracting and subcontracting opportunities for the Protégé firm.

(2) A letter of intent indicating that both the Mentor firm and the Protégé firm intend to enter into a contractual relationship under which the Protégé will perform as a subcontractor under the contract resulting from this solicitation and that the firms will negotiate a Mentor-Protégé agreement. The letter of intent must be signed by both parties and contain the following information:

(i) The name, address and phone number of both parties;

(ii) The Protégé firm's business classification, based upon the NAICS code(s) which represents the contemplated supplies or services to be provided by the Protégé firm to the Mentor firm;

(iii) A statement that the Protégé firm meets the eligibility criteria;

(iv) A preliminary assessment of the developmental needs of the Protégé firm and the proposed developmental assistance the Mentor firm envisions providing the Protégé. The offeror shall address those needs and how their assistance will enhance the Protégé. The offeror shall develop a schedule to assess the needs of the Protégé and establish criteria to evaluate the success in the Program;

(v) A statement that if the offeror or Protégé firm is suspended or debarred while performing under an approved Mentor-Protégé agreement the offeror shall promptly give notice of the suspension or debarment to the EPA Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) and the Contracting Officer. The statement shall require the Protégé firm to notify the Contractor if it is suspended or debarred.

(g) The application will be evaluated on the extent to which the offeror's proposal addresses the items listed in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. To the maximum extent possible, the application should be limited to not more than 10 single pages, double spaced. The offeror may identify more than one Protégé in its application.

(h) If the offeror is determined to be in the competitive range, or is awarded a contract without discussions, the offeror will be advised by the Contracting Officer whether their application is approved or rejected. The Contracting Officer, if necessary, may request additional information in connection with the offeror's submission of its revised or best and final offer. If the successful offeror has submitted an approved application, they shall comply with the clause titled “Mentor-Protégé Program.”

(i) Subcontracts of $1,000,000 or less awarded to firms approved as Protégés under the Program are exempt from the requirements for competition set forth in FAR 44.202-2(a)(5), and 52.244-5(b). However, price reasonableness must still be determined and the requirements in FAR 44.202-2(a)(8) for cost and price analysis continue to apply.

(j) Costs incurred by the offeror in fulfilling their agreement(s) with a Protégé firm(s) are not reimbursable as a direct cost under the contract. Unless EPA is the responsible audit agency under FAR 42.703-1, offerors are encouraged to enter into an advance agreement with their responsible audit agency on the treatment of such costs when determining indirect cost rates. Where EPA is the responsible audit agency, these costs will be considered in determining indirect cost rates.

(k) *Submission of Application and Questions Concerning the Program.* The application for the Program shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer, and to the EPA Office of Small Business Programs at the following address: Socioeconomic Business Program Officer, Office of Small Business Programs, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, William Jefferson Clinton Building (1230T), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20460, Telephone: (202) 566-2075, *Fax:* (202) 565-2473.
