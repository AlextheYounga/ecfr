Government Information (DEC 2012)

(a) *Definitions.* As used in this clause, “Government information” includes—

*Contractor-acquired information,* which means information acquired or otherwise collected by the Contractor on behalf of the Government in the context of the Contractor's duties under the contract.

*Government-furnished information (GFI),* which means information in the possession of, or directly acquired by, the Government and subsequently furnished to the Contractor for performance of a contract. GFI also includes contractor-acquired information if the contractor-acquired information is a deliverable under the contract and is for continued use under the contract. Otherwise, GFI does not include information that is created by the Contractor and delivered to the Government in accordance with the requirements of the work statement or specifications of the contract. The type, quantity, quality, and delivery requirements of such deliverable information are set forth elsewhere in the contract schedule.

(b) *Information Management and Information Security.*

(1) The Contractor shall manage, account for, and secure all Government information provided or acquired by the contractor. The Contractor shall be responsible for all Government information provided to its subcontractors. The Contractor agrees to include a requirement in each subcontract under this contract that flows down the protection from disclosure requirements.

(2) The Contractor's responsibility for Government information extends from the initial provision or acquisition and receipt of information, through stewardship, custody, and use until returned to, or otherwise disposed of, as directed by the Contracting Officer. This requirement applies to all Government information under the Contractor's accountability, stewardship, possession or control, including its subcontractors.

(c) *Use of Government information.* (1) The Contractor shall not use any information provided or acquired under this contract for any purpose other than in the performance of this contract.

(2) The Contractor shall not modify or alter the Government information, unless authorized in writing, in advance, by the Contracting Officer.

(d) *Government-furnished information.* (1) The Government shall deliver to the Contractor the information described below—

(i) The Government does not warrant the validity or accuracy of the Government-furnished information unless otherwise noted.

(ii) In the event that information received by the Contractor is not in a condition suitable for its intended use, the Contractor shall immediately notify the Contracting Officer in writing. Upon receipt of the Contractor's notification, the Contracting Officer shall advise the Contractor on a course of action to remedy the problem.

(iii) If either the failure of the Government to provide information to the Contractor by the dates shown in this clause or the remedial action taken under this clause to correct defective information causes an increase or decrease in the Contractor's cost of, or the time required for, the performance of any part of the work under this contract, the Contracting Officer shall consider an equitable adjustment to the contract. The Contractor shall provide to the Contracting Officer its written statement describing the general nature and amount of the equitable adjustment proposal within 30 days after the remedial action described in paragraph (ii) herein is completed, or within 30 days after the date upon which the Government failed to provide information, unless the Contracting Officer extends this period.

(3)(i) The Contracting Officer may, by written notice, at any time—

Such notification may be by electronic mail.

(g) *Contractor liability for Government information.* (1) Unless otherwise provided for in the contract, the Contractor shall not be liable for loss, theft, damage, or destruction to the Government information furnished or acquired under this contract, except when the loss, theft, damage, or destruction is the result of the Contractor's failure to properly manage, account for, and safeguard the information in accordance with this clause.

(2) In the event of any loss, theft, damage, or destruction of Government information, the Contractor shall immediately take all reasonable actions necessary to protect the Government information from further loss, theft, damage, or destruction.

(3) The Contractor shall do nothing to prejudice the Government's rights to recover against third parties for any loss, theft, damage, or destruction of Government information.

(h) *Information alteration and disposal.* Except as otherwise provided for in this contract, the Contractor shall not alter, destroy, or otherwise dispose of any Government information unless expressly directed by the Contracting Officer to do so.

(i) *Return of Government information to the Government.* (1) The Government may require the Contractor to return Government Information to the Government at any time.

(3) An increase, decrease, or substitution of Government-furnished information.

Subcontracts shall clearly describe the Government information provided to the subcontractor. The Contractor shall be responsible for all Government information provided to subcontractors.
