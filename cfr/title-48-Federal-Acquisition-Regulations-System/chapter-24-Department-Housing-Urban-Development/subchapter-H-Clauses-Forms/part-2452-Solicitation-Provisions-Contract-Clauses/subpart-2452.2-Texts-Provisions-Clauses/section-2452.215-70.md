*Alternate I* (MAR 2016) As prescribed in 2415.209(a), if the proposed contract requires work on, or access to, sensitive automated systems as described in 2452.239-70, add the following subparagraph, numbered sequentially, to paragraph (d):

(End of provision)

*Alternate II* (MAR 2016) As prescribed in 2415.209(a), add the following paragraph (e) when the size of any proposal Part I or Part II will be limited:

(e) *Size limits of Parts I and II.* (1) Offerors shall limit submissions of Parts I and II of their initial proposals to the page limitations identified in the Instructions to Offerors. Offerors are cautioned that, if any Part of their proposal exceeds the stipulated limits for that Part, the Government will evaluate only the information contained in the pages up through the permitted number. Pages beyond that limit will not be evaluated.
