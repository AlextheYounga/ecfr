As prescribed in 48 CFR 1316.307(b), insert the following clause:

 Level of Effort (Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Term Contract) (Date)

(a) In performance of the effort directed in this contract, the contractor shall provide the total of Direct Productive Labor Hours (DPLH) as specified in Part I, Section B during the term specified in Section \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. DPLH is defined as actual work hours exclusive of vacation, holidays, sick leave, and other absences.

(b) Only the DPLH categories indicated below shall be charged directly to the contract. It is estimated that the DPLH will be expended approximately as follows:

|  Labor category  |Base  <br/>period|Option  <br/>period I|Option  <br/>period II|Option  <br/>period III|
|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
|    xxxxxxxxxx    |      xxxx       |        xxxx         |         xxxx         |         xxxx          |
|    xxxxxxxxxx    |      xxxx       |        xxxx         |         xxxx         |         xxxx          |
|Total Direct Labor|      xxxx       |        xxxx         |         xxxx         |         xxxx          |

(c) The hours specified above are provided as estimates only. If the actual amount of hours incurred falls within 90% to 110% of this estimate, the fee shall not be adjusted.

(d) In the event that the contractor shall be required to provide less than 90% of the estimated DPLH, the fixed fee of the contract shall be equitably adjusted by unilateral modification to the contract. The fixed fee adjustment shall be based solely upon the difference between the DPLH actually provided and 90% of the estimated DPLH, calculated as follows:

Adjusted Fixed Fee = (Actual DPLH/(.9 × Estimated DPLH)) × Specified Fixed Fee

(e) In the event that the contractor shall be required to provide more than 110% of the estimated DPLH, the fixed fee of the Contract shall be equitably adjusted by unilateral modification to the Contract. The fixed fee adjustment shall be based solely upon the difference between the DPLH actually provided and 110% of the estimated DPLH, calculated as follows:

Adjusted Fixed Fee = (Actual DPLH/(1.1 × Estimated DPLH)) × Specified Fixed Fee

(f) These terms and conditions do not supersede the requirements of either FAR clause 52.232-20 “Limitation of Cost” or FAR clause 52.232-22 “Limitation of Funds.”
