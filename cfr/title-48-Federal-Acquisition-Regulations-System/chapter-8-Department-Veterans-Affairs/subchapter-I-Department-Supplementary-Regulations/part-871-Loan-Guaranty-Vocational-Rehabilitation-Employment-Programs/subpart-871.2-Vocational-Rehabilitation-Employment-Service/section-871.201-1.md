The VA negotiates contracts for tuition, fees, books, supplies, and other allowable expenses incurred by an institution, training establishment, or employer for the training and rehabilitation of eligible veterans under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31 when the following services are provided:

(a) *Courses of instruction by correspondence* means a course of education or training conducted by mail consisting of regular lessons or reading assignments, the preparation of required written work that involves the application of principles studied in each lesson, the correction of assigned work with such suggestions or recommendation as may be necessary to instruct the student, the keeping of student achievement records, and issuance of a diploma, certificate, or other evidence to the student upon satisfactorily completing the requirements of the course.

(b) *Special services or special courses that are furnished at the request of the VA.* Special services or courses are those services or courses that VA requests that are over and above those the institution customarily provides for similarly circumstanced non-veterans and that the contracting officer considers to be necessary for the rehabilitation of the trainee.
