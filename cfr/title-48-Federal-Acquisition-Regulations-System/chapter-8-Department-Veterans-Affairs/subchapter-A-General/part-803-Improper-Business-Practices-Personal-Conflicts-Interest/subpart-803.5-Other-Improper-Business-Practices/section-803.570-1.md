Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 16208, Apr. 16, 2018.

It is VA policy that contractors will not advertise the award of contracts or refer to VA contracts in contractors' commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that VA endorses a product, project, or commercial line of endeavor. The intent of this policy is to preclude the appearance of bias toward any product or service.
