It is VA policy that contractors will not advertise the award of contracts or refer to VA contracts in contractors' commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that VA endorses a product, project, or commercial line of endeavor. The intent of this policy is to preclude the appearance of bias toward any product or service.
