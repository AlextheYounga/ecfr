##### 803.705 Procedures. #####

In making a determination to void or rescind a contract, the DSPE must follow the procedures of FAR 3.705 and the following:

(a) Upon receipt of an allegation or evidence of situations meeting the provisions of FAR 3.700, the DSPE shall refer the matter to the D&S Committee to conduct a finding of facts. Upon completion of the fact-finding, the D&S Committee shall present the facts and recommendations for further action to the DSPE.

(b) If the DSPE finds a basis for further action, the D&S Committee shall prepare a notice under FAR 3.705 for signature of the DSPE. If suspension or debarment is being considered, the D&S Committee shall also follow the procedures of 809.4. The signed notice will be sent to the last known address of the contractor, the contractor's counsel, or registered agent, by certified mail, return receipt requested. In the case of a business, the D&S Committee may send the notice to any partner, principal, officer, director, owner or co-owner, or joint venture.

(c) If VA does not receive a reply from the contractor within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice by the addressee, the D&S Committee will prepare a recommendation and refer the case to the DSPE for a decision on whether or not to take further action under FAR 3.705.

(d) If VA receives a reply from the contractor within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice, the D&S Committee must consider the information in the reply before the D&S Committee makes its recommendation to the DSPE.

(e) The D&S Committee, upon the request of the contractor, must, as soon as practicable, allow the contractor an opportunity to appear before the D&S Committee, in person or through a representative, to present information or argument. The contractor may supplement the oral presentation with written information and argument. The proceeding will be conducted in an informal manner and without requirement for a transcript. The D&S Committee shall prepare a report of the presentation for submission to the DSPE.

(f) If the D&S Committee finds that the contractor's submission in opposition to further action under FAR 3.705 raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the action, then the D&S Committee shall submit to the DSPE the information establishing the dispute of material facts. If the DSPE agrees that there is a genuine dispute of material facts, the DSPE shall refer the dispute to a designee for resolution under 809.470. The DSPE may reject the findings of the fact-finding official only if the findings are clearly erroneous or arbitrary and capricious.

(g) If there are no disputes over material facts or if all disputes over material facts have been resolved under 809.470, the DSPE will make a decision on the basis of all information available, including findings of facts and oral or written arguments presented or submitted to the D&S Committee by the contractor.
