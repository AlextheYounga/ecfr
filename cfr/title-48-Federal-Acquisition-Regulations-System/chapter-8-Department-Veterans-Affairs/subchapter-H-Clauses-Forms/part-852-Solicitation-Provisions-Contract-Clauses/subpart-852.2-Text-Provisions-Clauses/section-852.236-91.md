As prescribed in 836.579, insert the following clause:

Special Notes (JUL 2002)

(a) Signing of the bid shall be deemed to be a representation by the bidder that:

(1) Bidder is a construction contractor who owns, operates, or maintains a place of business, regularly engaged in construction, alteration, or repair of buildings, structures, and communications facilities, or other engineering projects, including furnishing and installing of necessary equipment; or

(2) If newly entering into a construction activity, bidder has made all necessary arrangements for personnel, construction equipment, and required licenses to perform construction work; and

(3) Upon request, prior to award, bidder will promptly furnish to the Government a statement of facts in detail as to bidder's previous experience (including recent and current contracts), organization (including company officers), technical qualifications, financial resources and facilities available to perform the contemplated work.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in this contract, where the use of optional materials or construction is permitted, the same standard of workmanship, fabrication and installation shall be required irrespective of which option is selected. The contractor shall make any change or adjustment in connecting work or otherwise necessitated by the use of such optional material or construction, without additional cost to the Government.

(c) When approval is given for a system component having functional or physical characteristics different from those indicated or specified, it is the responsibility of the contractor to furnish and install related components with characteristics and capacities compatible with the approved substitute component as required for systems to function as noted on drawings and specifications. There shall be no additional cost to the Government.

(d) In some instances it may have been impracticable to detail all items in specifications or on drawings because of variances in manufacturers' methods of achieving specified results. In such instances the contractor will be required to furnish all labor, materials, drawings, services and connections necessary to produce systems or equipment which are completely installed, functional, and ready for operation by facility personnel in accordance with their intended use.

(e) Claims by the contractor for delay attributed to unusually severe weather must be supported by climatological data covering the period and the same period for the 10 preceding years. When the weather in question exceeds in intensity or frequency the 10-year average, the excess experienced shall be considered “unusually severe.” Comparison shall be on a monthly basis. Whether or not unusually severe weather in fact delays the work will depend upon the effect of weather on the branches of work being performed during the time under consideration.
