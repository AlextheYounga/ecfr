As prescribed in 832.111, insert the following clause in contracts that contain a section entitled “Network Analysis System (NAS).”

Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (JUL 2002)

The clause entitled “Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts” in FAR 52.232-5 is implemented as follows:

(a) Retainage:

(1) The contracting officer may retain funds:

(i) Where the performance under the contract has been determined to be deficient or the contractor has performed in an unsatisfactory manner in the past; or

(ii) As the contract nears completion, to ensure that deficiencies will be corrected and that completion is timely.

(2) Examples of deficient performance justifying a retention of funds include, but are not restricted to, the following:

(i) Unsatisfactory progress as determined by the contracting officer;

(ii) Failure either to meet schedules in Section Network Analysis System (NAS), or to process the Interim Arrow Diagram/Complete Project Arrow Diagram;

(iii) Failure to present submittals in a timely manner; or

(iv) Failure to comply in good faith with approved subcontracting plans, certifications, or contract requirements.

(3) Any level of retention shall not exceed 10 percent either where there is determined to be unsatisfactory performance, or when the retainage is to ensure satisfactory completion. Retained amounts shall be paid promptly upon completion of all contract requirements, but nothing contained in this subparagraph shall be construed as limiting the contracting officer's right to withhold funds under other provisions of the contract or in accordance with the general law and regulations regarding the administration of Government contracts.

(b) The contractor shall submit a schedule of costs in accordance with the requirements of Section Network Analysis System (NAS) to the contracting officer for approval within 90 calendar days after date of receipt of notice to proceed. The approved cost schedule will be one of the bases for determining progress payments to the contractor for work completed.

(1) Costs as shown on this schedule must be true costs and, should the resident engineer so desire, he/she may require the contractor to submit his/her original estimate sheets or other information to substantiate the detailed makeup of the cost schedule.

(2) The total costs of all activities shall equal the contract price.

(3) Insurance and similar items shall be prorated and included in each activity cost of the critical path method (CPM) network.

(4) The CPM network shall include a separate cost loaded activity for adjusting and testing of the systems listed in the table in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. The percentages listed below will be used to determine the cost of adjust and test activities and identify, for payment purposes, the value of the work to adjust, correct and test systems after the material has been installed.

(5) Payment for adjust and test activities will be made only after the contractor has demonstrated that each of the systems is substantially complete and operates as required by the contract.

(End of clause)

*Alternate I* (JUL 2002). If the specifications include guarantee period services, the contracting officer shall include the following paragraphs as additions to paragraph (b) of the basic clause:

(6)(i) The contractor shall show on the critical path method (CPM) network the total cost of the guarantee period services in accordance with the guarantee period service section(s) of the specifications. This cost shall be priced out when submitting the CMP cost loaded network. The cost submitted shall be subject to the approval of the contracting officer. The activity on the CPM shall have money only and not activity time.

(ii) The contractor shall submit with the CPM a guarantee period performance program which shall include an itemized accounting of the number of work-hours required to perform the guarantee period service on each piece of equipment. The contractor shall also submit the established salary costs, including employee fringe benefits, and what the contractor reasonably expects to pay over the guarantee period, all of which will be subject to the contracting officer's approval.

(iii) The cost of the guarantee period service shall be prorated on an annual basis and paid in equal monthly payments by VA during the period of guarantee. In the event the installer does not perform satisfactorily during this period, all payments may be withheld and the contracting officer shall inform the contractor of the unsatisfactory performance, allowing the contractor 10 days to correct and comply with the contract. The guarantee period service is subject to those provisions as set forth in the Payments and Default clauses.
