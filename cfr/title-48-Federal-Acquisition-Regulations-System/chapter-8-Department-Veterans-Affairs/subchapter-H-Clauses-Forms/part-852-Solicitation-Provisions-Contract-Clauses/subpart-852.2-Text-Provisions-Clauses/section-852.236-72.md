Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 9974, Mar. 19, 2019.

As prescribed in 836.501, insert the following clause:

Performance of Work by the Contractor (JUL 2002)

The clause entitled “Performance of Work by the Contractor” in FAR 52.236-1 is supplemented as follows:

(a) Contract work accomplished on the site by laborers, mechanics, and foremen/forewomen on the contractor's payroll and under his/her direct supervision shall be included in establishing the percent of work to be performed by the contractor. Cost of material and equipment installed by such labor may be included. The work by the contractor's executive, supervisory and clerical forces shall be excluded in establishing compliance with the requirements of this clause.

(b) The contractor shall submit, simultaneously with the schedule of costs required by the Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts clause of the contract, a statement designating the branch or branches of contract work to be performed with his/her forces. The approved schedule of costs will be used in determining the value of a branch or branches, or portions thereof, of the work for the purpose of this article.

(c) If, during the progress of work hereunder, the contractor requests a change in the branch or branches of the work to be performed by his/her forces and the contracting officer determines it to be in the best interest of the Government, the contracting officer may, at his/her discretion, authorize a change in such branch or branches of said work. Nothing contained herein shall permit a reduction in the percentage of work to be performed by the contractor with his/her forces, it being expressly understood that this is a contract requirement without right or privilege of reduction.

(d) In the event the contractor fails or refuses to meet the requirement of the FAR clause at 52.236-1, it is expressly agreed that the contract price will be reduced by 15 percent of the value of that portion of the percentage requirement that is accomplished by others. For the purpose of this clause, it is agreed that 15 percent is an acceptable estimate of the contractor's overhead and profit, or mark-up, on that portion of the work which the contractor fails or refuses to perform, with his/her own forces, in accordance with the FAR clause at 52.236-1.

(End of clause)

*Alternate I (Date).* For requirements which include Network Analysis System (NAS), substitute the following paragraphs (b) and (c) for paragraphs (b) and (c) of the basic clause:

(b) The contractor shall submit, simultaneously with the cost per activity of the construction schedule required by Section 01310 or 01311, NETWORK ANALYSIS SYSTEM, a responsibility code for all activities of the network for which the contractor's forces will perform the work. The cost of these activities will be used in determining the portions of the total contract work to be executed by the contractor's forces for the purpose of this article.

(c) If, during progress of work hereunder, the contractor requests a change in activities of work to be performed by the contractor's forces and the contracting officer determines it to be in the best interest of the Government, the contracting officer may, at his or her discretion, authorize a change in such activities of said work.
