Supplementary Labor Standards Provisions (APR 1984)

(a) The wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor is set forth in section GR, General Requirements, of this contract. It is the result of a study of wage conditions in the locality and establishes the minimum hourly rates of wages and fringe benefits for the described classes of labor in accordance with applicable law. No increase in the contract price will be allowed or authorized because of payment of wage rates in excess of those listed.

(b) The contractor shall submit the required copies of payrolls to the contracting officer through the resident engineer or engineer officer, when acting in that capacity. Department of Labor Form WH-347, Payroll, available from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, may be used for this purpose. If, however, the contractor or subcontractor elects to use an individually composed payroll form, it shall contain the same information shown on Form WH-347, and in addition be accompanied by Department of Labor Form WH-348, Statement of Compliance, or any other form containing the exact wording of this form.
