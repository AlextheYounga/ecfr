Alternative Evaluation (JAN 2003)

During the specified period for receipt of offers, the amount of the lowest offer will be posted and may be viewed by [*Contracting officer insert description of how the information may be viewed electronically or otherwise*]. Offerors may revise offers anytime during the specified period. At the end of the specified time period for receipt of offers, the responsible offeror submitting the lowest priced offer will be in line for award.
