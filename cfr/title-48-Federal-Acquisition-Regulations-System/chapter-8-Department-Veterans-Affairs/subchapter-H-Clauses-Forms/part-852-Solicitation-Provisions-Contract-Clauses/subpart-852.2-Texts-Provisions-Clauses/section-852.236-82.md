##### 852.236-82 Payments under fixed-price construction contracts (without NAS). #####

As prescribed in 832.111, insert the following clause in contracts that do not contain a section entitled “Network Analysis System (NAS).”

Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts (APR 1984)

The clause entitled “Payments Under Fixed-Price Construction Contracts” in FAR 52.232-5 is implemented as follows:

(a) Retainage:

(1) The contracting officer may retain funds:

(i) Where performance under the contract has been determined to be deficient or the contractor has performed in an unsatisfactory manner in the past; or

(ii) As the contract nears completion, to ensure that deficiencies will be corrected and that completion is timely.

(2) Examples of deficient performance justifying a retention of funds include, but are not restricted to, the following:

(i) Unsatisfactory progress as determined by the contracting officer;

(ii) Failure to meet schedule in Schedule of Work Progress;

(iii) Failure to present submittals in a timely manner; or

(iv) Failure to comply in good faith with approved subcontracting plans, certifications, or contract requirements.

(3) Any level of retention shall not exceed 10 percent either where there is determined to be unsatisfactory performance, or when the retainage is to ensure satisfactory completion. Retained amounts shall be paid promptly upon completion of all contract requirements, but nothing contained in this subparagraph shall be construed as limiting the contracting officer's right to withhold funds under other provisions of the contract or in accordance with the general law and regulations regarding the administration of Government contracts.

(b) The contractor shall submit a schedule of cost to the contracting officer for approval within 30 calendar days after date of receipt of notice to proceed. Such schedule will be signed and submitted in triplicate. The approved cost schedule will be one of the bases for determining progress payments to the contractor for work completed. This schedule shall show cost by the branches of work for each building or unit of the contract, as instructed by the resident engineer.

(1) The branches shall be subdivided into as many sub-branches as are necessary to cover all component parts of the contract work.

(2) Costs as shown on this schedule must be true costs and, should the resident engineer so desire, he/she may require the contractor to submit the original estimate sheets or other information to substantiate the detailed makeup of the schedule.

(3) The sum of the sub-branches, as applied to each branch, shall equal the total cost of such branch. The total cost of all branches shall equal the contract price.

(4) Insurance and similar items shall be prorated and included in the cost of each branch of the work.

(5) The cost schedule shall include separate cost information for the systems listed in the table in this paragraph (b)(5). The percentages listed below are proportions of the cost listed in the contractor's cost schedule and identify, for payment purposes, the value of the work to adjust, correct and test systems after the material has been installed. Payment of the listed percentages will be made only after the contractor has demonstrated that each of the systems is substantially complete and operates as required by the contract.

(End of clause)

*Alternate I* (JUL 2002). If the specifications include guarantee period services, the contracting officer shall include the following paragraphs as additions to paragraph (b) of the basic clause:

(6)(i) The contractor shall at the time of contract award furnish the total cost of the guarantee period services in accordance with specification section(s) covering guarantee period services. The contractor shall submit, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notice to proceed, a guarantee period performance program that shall include an itemized accounting of the number of work-hours required to perform the guarantee period service on each piece of equipment. The contractor shall also submit the established salary costs, including employee fringe benefits, and what the contractor reasonably expects to pay over the guarantee period, all of which will be subject to the contracting officer's approval.

(ii) The cost of the guarantee period service shall be prorated on an annual basis and paid in equal monthly payments by VA during the period of guarantee. In the event the installer does not perform satisfactorily during this period, all payments may be withheld and the contracting officer shall inform the contractor of the unsatisfactory performance, allowing the contractor 10 days to correct deficiencies and comply with the contract. The guarantee period service is subject to those provisions as set forth in the Payments and Default clauses.
