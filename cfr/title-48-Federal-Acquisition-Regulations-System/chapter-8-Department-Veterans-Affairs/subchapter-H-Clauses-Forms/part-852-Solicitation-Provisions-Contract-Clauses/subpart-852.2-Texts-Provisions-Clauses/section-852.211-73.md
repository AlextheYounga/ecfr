As prescribed in 811.104-71, insert the following clause:

Brand Name or Equal (JAN 2008)(Note:

As used in this clause, the term “brand name” includes identification of products by make and model.)

(a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a “brand name or equal” description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering “equal” products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.

(b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an “equal” product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.

(c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an “equal” product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:

(i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and

(ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.

(2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:

(i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and

(ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.

(3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.
