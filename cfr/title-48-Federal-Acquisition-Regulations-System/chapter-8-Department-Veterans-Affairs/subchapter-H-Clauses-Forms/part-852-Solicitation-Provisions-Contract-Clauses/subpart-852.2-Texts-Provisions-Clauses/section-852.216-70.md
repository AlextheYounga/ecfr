##### 852.216-70 Estimated quantities. #####

As prescribed in 816.504(a), insert the following clause:

Estimated Quantities (APR 1984)

As it is impossible to determine the exact quantities that will be required during the contract term, each bidder whose bid is accepted wholly or in part will be required to deliver all articles or services that may be ordered during the contract term, except as he/she otherwise indicates in his/her bid and except as otherwise provided herein. Bids will be considered if made with the proviso that the total quantities delivered shall not exceed a certain specified quantity. Bids offering less than 75 percent of the estimated requirement or which provide that the Government shall guarantee any definite quantity, will not be considered. The fact that quantities are estimated shall not relieve the contractor from filling all orders placed under this contract to the extent of his/her obligation. Also, the Department of Veterans Affairs shall not be relieved of its obligation to order from the contractor all articles or services that may, in the judgment of the ordering officer, be needed except that in the public exigency procurement may be made without regard to this contract.
