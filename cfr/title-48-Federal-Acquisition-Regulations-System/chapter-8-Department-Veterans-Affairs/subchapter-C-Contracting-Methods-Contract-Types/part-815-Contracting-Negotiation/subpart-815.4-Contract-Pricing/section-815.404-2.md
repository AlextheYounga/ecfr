##### 815.404-2 Information to support proposal analysis. #####

In evaluating start-up and other non-recurring costs, the contracting officer must determine the extent to which these costs are included in the proposed price and the intent to absorb or recover the costs in any future noncompetitive procurement or other pricing action. The contracting officer must ensure, with the assistance of the Assistant Inspector General for Policy, Planning, and Resources, as required or considered necessary, that VA will not pay the costs twice. For example, the cost of equipment that the Government pays for through a setup or connection agreement must not be included in depreciation cost of a subsequently negotiated agreement.
