##### 813.106-70 Oral purchase orders. #####

When advantageous to VA, the contracting officer may use an oral purchase order for transactions not in excess of $3,000. This limitation does not apply to delivery orders against existing contracts, e.g., delivery orders against Federal Supply Schedule contracts. The contracting officer must assign a purchase order number to the transaction. A copy of any electronically generated purchase order may be used as a property voucher and receiving report to document receipt.
