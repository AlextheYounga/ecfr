##### 813.106-70 Oral purchase orders. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 16906, Mar. 25, 2020.

When advantageous to VA, the contracting officer may use an oral purchase order for transactions not in excess of $3,000. This limitation does not apply to delivery orders against existing contracts, e.g., delivery orders against Federal Supply Schedule contracts. The contracting officer must assign a purchase order number to the transaction. A copy of any electronically generated purchase order may be used as a property voucher and receiving report to document receipt.
