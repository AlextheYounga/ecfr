##### 842.801-70 Audit assistance prior to disallowing costs. #####

If a contracting officer determines that costs should be disallowed during the performance of a cost reimbursement, fixed-price incentive, or fixed-price redetermination contract exceeding the thresholds specified in FAR 15.403-4, the contracting officer must request audit assistance. The VA OIG shall conduct audits of contracts for health care resources and contracting officers shall request such audits directly from that office. For all other types of contracts, the contracting officer must obtain an audit control number from Acquisition Resources Service and send a formal request to conduct the audit directly to the nearest Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) office, referencing the audit control number and the project number (if any).
