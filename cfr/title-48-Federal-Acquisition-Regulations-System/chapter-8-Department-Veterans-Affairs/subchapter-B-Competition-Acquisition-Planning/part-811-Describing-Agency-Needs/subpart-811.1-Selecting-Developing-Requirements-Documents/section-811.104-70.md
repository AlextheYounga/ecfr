##### 811.104-70 Brand name or equal purchase descriptions. #####

(a) The specification writer may use purchase descriptions that contain references to one or more brand name products only in accordance with 811.104-71 through 811.104-75.

(b) Purchase descriptions that contain references to one or more brand name products must be followed by the words “or equal,” except when the acquisition of a specific brand name is fully justified under FAR Subpart 6.3 and 806.3. If more than one brand name is acceptable, the contracting officer should list the known acceptable brand name products in the solicitation.

(c) Where a “brand name or equal” purchase description is used, the contracting officer must give bidders an opportunity to offer products other than those specifically referenced by brand name. Following bid opening or receipt of offers, the contracting officer must determine if non-“brand name” substitute products fully meet the salient characteristics listed in the solicitation.

(d) When using a “brand name or equal” purchase description, the specification writer must set forth those salient physical, functional, or other characteristics of the referenced products that are essential to the minimum needs of the Government. For example, when interchangeability of parts is required, the specification writer must specify this requirement. The purchase description must contain the following information to the extent available:

(1) Complete common generic identification of the item required.

(2) Applicable model, make, or catalog number for each brand name product referenced and identity of the commercial catalog in which it appears.

(3) Name of manufacturer, producer, or distributor of each brand name product referenced (and address if not well known).

(4) Any other information necessary to describe the item required.

(e) When necessary to adequately describe the item required, the contracting officer may use an applicable commercial catalog description or pertinent extract if the description is identified in the solicitation as being that of the particular named manufacturer, producer, or distributor. The contracting officer must insure that a copy of any catalog referenced (except a parts catalog) is available on request for review by bidders at the purchasing office.

(f) Except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section, the specification writer must not include in a purchase description either minimum or maximum restrictive dimensions, weights, materials, or other salient characteristics that are unique to a brand name product or that would tend to eliminate competition or other products that are only marginally outside the restrictions. However, the specification writer may include in a purchase description restrictive dimensions, weights, materials, or other salient characteristic if:

(1) The user determines in writing that the restrictions are essential to the Government's requirements;

(2) The specification writer includes the brand name of the product in the purchase description; and,

(3) The contracting officer makes all other determinations required by 811.105.

(g) The contracting officer must include in the contract file, as appropriate, written justifications for using the “brand name or equal” description, the contracting officer's determinations, and bidder submissions.
