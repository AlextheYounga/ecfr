VA contracting officers must place delivery orders against IDIQ contracts, awarded by VISN, regional, or a local facility contracting officers, for supplies not covered by national committed use contracts or Federal Supply Schedule contracts in the following descending order of priority:

(i) VISN or regionally awarded contracts.

(ii) Locally awarded contracts.

(b) *Unusual or compelling urgency.* The contracting officer may use a source lower in priority than as specified in paragraph (a) of this section when the need for supplies or services is of an unusual or compelling urgency (see FAR 6.302-2). The Contracting Officer must include a justification for each deviation in the procurement file.

(c) *Eligible Beneficiaries.* (1) A contracting officer may authorize an acquisition from the Veterans Canteen Service or a commercial source when a VA healthcare official (e.g., social worker, physician) determines that personal selection of shoes, clothing, and incidentals will result in a therapeutic benefit to an eligible beneficiary.

(2) The contracting officer must cite Federal Prison Industries, Inc., clearance No. 1206 in the purchase document for any purchase from a commercial source of dress shoes similar to Federal Prison Industries, Inc., Style No. 86-A.
