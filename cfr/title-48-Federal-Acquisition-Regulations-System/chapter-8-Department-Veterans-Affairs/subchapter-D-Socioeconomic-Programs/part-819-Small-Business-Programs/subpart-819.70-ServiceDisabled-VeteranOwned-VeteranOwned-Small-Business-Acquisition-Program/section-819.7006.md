##### 819.7006 Veteran-owned small business set-aside procedures. #####

(a) The contracting officer shall consider SDVOSB set-asides before considering VOSB set-asides. Except as authorized by 813.106, 819.7007 and 819.7008, the contracting officer shall set aside an acquisition for competition restricted to VOSB concerns upon a reasonable expectation that:

(1) Offers will be received from two or more eligible VOSB concerns; and

(2) Award will be made at a fair and reasonable price.

(b) If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer at a fair and reasonable price from an eligible VOSB concern in response to a VOSB set-aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that concern. If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from eligible VOSB concerns, the set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for other small business programs, as appropriate.

(c) When conducting VOSB set-asides, the contracting officer shall ensure the business is registered and verified as eligible in the VIP database prior to making an award.
