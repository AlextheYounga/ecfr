Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 49306, Oct. 1, 2018.

(a) When preparing specification packages, contracting officers must give full consideration to the time reasonably required for constructive acceptance or approval of the goods or services and for making invoice payments. Based on this analysis, contracting officers may, when authorized by FAR 32.904, modify the number of days allowed for notifying contractors of defects in invoices or, for construction solicitations, the number of days allowed for payment of invoices specified in the applicable prompt payment clause. Changes, if any, should be made before issuing the solicitation.

(b)(1) For construction solicitations, the analysis specified in paragraph (a) of this section may routinely take more than the 7 days provided in paragraph (a)(2) of the FAR clause at 52.232-27, Prompt Payment for Construction Contracts, to evaluate and return defective progress payment invoices.

(2) It also may take more than the 14 days provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of the prompt payment clause to adequately inspect the work, determine the adequacy of the contractor's performance, approve, and pay progress payment invoices.

(3) Contracting officers should consider the following and, if necessary, revise the number of days stated in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(1)(i)(A) of the prompt payment clause before issuing construction solicitations (see FAR 32.904(d)(1)(i)):

(i) Recent interest payment history.

(ii) The complexity of the project.

(iii) Workload.

(iv) Work site location.

(4) In no event may the number of days be set in excess of 14 days for return of a defective progress payment invoice or 30 days for payment of the invoice.
