##### 833.103 Protests to VA. #####

(a) *Filing of protests.* (1) An interested party may protest to the contracting officer or, as an alternative, may request an independent review by filing a protest with the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management (DAS for A&MM), or for solicitations issued by the Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management. A protest filed with the DAS for A&MM or the Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, will not be considered if the interested party has a protest on the same or similar issues pending with the contracting officer.

(2) Protests to the contracting officer must be in writing and addressed where the offer/bid is to be submitted.

(3) Protests requesting an independent review must be in writing and addressed to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Materiel Management, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420; or, for solicitations issued by the Office of Construction and Facilities Management, to the Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420.

(4) The following types of protests may be dismissed by VA without consideration of the merits or forwarded to another agency for appropriate action:

(i) *Contract administration.* Disputes between a contractor and VA are resolved under the disputes clause of the contract and the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. (41 U.S.C. 601-613).

(ii) *Small business size standards and standard industrial classification.* Challenges of established size standards or the size status of particular firms, and challenges of the selected standard industrial classification are for review solely by the Small Business Administration (SBA). (15 U.S.C. 637(b)(6); 13 CFR 121.1002).

(iii) *Small business certificate of competency program.* A protest made under section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act, or in regard to any issuance of a certificate of competency or refusal to issue a certificate under that section, is not reviewed in accordance with bid protest procedures unless there is a showing of possible fraud or bad faith on the part of Government officials.

(iv) *Protests under section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.* The decision to place or not to place a procurement under the 8(a) program is not subject to review unless there is a showing of possible fraud or bad faith on the part of Government officials or that regulations may have been violated. (15 U.S.C. 637(a)).

(v) *Affirmative determination of responsibility by the Contracting Officer.* An affirmative determination of responsibility will not be reviewed unless there is a showing that such determination was made fraudulently or in bad faith or that definitive responsibility criteria in the solicitation were not met.

(vi) *Walsh-Healey Public Contract Act.* Challenges of the legal status of a firm as a regular dealer or manufacturer within the meaning of the Walsh-Healey Act is determined solely by the procuring agency, the SBA (if a small business is involved), and the Secretary of Labor. (41 U.S.C. 35-45).

(vii) *Subcontractor protests.* The contracting agency will not consider subcontractor protests except where the subcontract is by or for the Government.

(viii) *Judicial proceedings.* The contracting agency will not consider protests where the matter involved is the subject of litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) *Alternative dispute resolution.* Bidders/offerors and VA contracting officers are encouraged to use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures to resolve protests at any stage in the protest process. If ADR is used, VA will not furnish any documentation in an ADR proceeding beyond what is allowed by the FAR.

(c) *Action upon receipt of protest.* For protests filed with the contracting officer, the HCA will be the approving official for the determinations identified in FAR 33.103(f)(1) and (f)(3). If the HCA is also the contracting officer, the approving official will be the DAS for A&MM. For protests filed with the DAS for A&MM or the Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, those individuals will be the approving officials for the determinations identified in FAR 33.103(f)(1) and (f)(3).

(d) *Requests for GAO advance decisions.* When a written protest has been filed with the contracting officer and the contracting officer considers it desirable to do so, the contracting officer may request an advance decision from the Comptroller General. The contracting officer must send the submission to the Comptroller General through the DAS for A&MM or the Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, as appropriate, and must include the material listed in FAR 33.104(a). The contracting officer must promptly notify the protesting individual or firm in writing of the decision of the Comptroller General.

(e) *Protest after award.* When a written protest is filed with the contracting officer after contract award, the following requirements apply:

(1) If FAR 33.103(f)(3) requires suspension of contract performance, the contracting officer must seek to obtain a mutual agreement with the contractor to suspend performance on a no-cost basis. If unsuccessful, the contracting officer must issue a stop-work order in accordance with contract clause FAR 52.233-3, Protest after Award.

(2) If suspension of contract performance is not required by FAR 33.103(f)(3) and if the contracting officer determines that the award was proper, the contracting officer must furnish the protester a written explanation of the basis for the award that is responsive to the allegations of the protest. The contracting officer will advise the protester that the protester may appeal the determination to one of the following:

(i) The DAS for A&MM.

(ii) The Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management, in the case of a contract awarded by the Office of Construction and Facilities Management.

(iii) The Comptroller General.

(3) If suspension of contract performance is not required by FAR 33.103(f)(3) but the contracting officer determines that the award is questionable, the contracting officer, after consulting with OGC, will advise the contractor of the protest and invite the contractor to submit comments and relevant information. The contracting officer must submit the case promptly to the DAS for A&MM for advice. The DAS for A&MM may consult with OGC and will either advise the contracting officer of the appropriate action to take, or submit the case to the Comptroller General, through the Assistant Secretary for Management, for a decision. The contracting officer will provide interested parties with a copy of the final decision.

(f) *Agency appellate review of the contracting officer's protest decision.* An interested party may request an independent review of a contracting officer's protest decision by filing an appeal with the DAS for A&MM or, for solicitations issued by the Office of Construction and Facilities Management, with the Director, Office of Construction and Facilities Management. To be considered timely, the appeal must be received by the appropriate official named in this paragraph within 10 calendar days of the date the interested party knew, or should have known, whichever is earlier, of the basis for the appeal. Appeals must be addressed as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section. Appeals do not extend GAO's timeliness requirements for appeals to GAO. By filing an appeal as provided in this paragraph, an interested party may waive its rights to further appeal to the Comptroller General at a later date. Agency responses to appeals submitted to the agency shall be reviewed and concurred in by OGC (025).
