(a) VA may pay the customary student health fee when payment of the fee is required for similarly circumstanced nonveterans. If payment of the fee is not required for similarly circumstanced nonveterans, payment may be made if it is determined by the Veterans Health Administration that payment is in the best interest of the veteran and the Government.

(b) When the customary student's health fee does not cover medical services or hospital care, but these medical services are available in a school-operated facility or with doctors and hospitals in the immediate area through a prior arrangement, the Veterans Benefits Administration may provide reimbursement for these services in a contract for the services if:

(1) An arrangement is necessary to provide timely medical services for veterans attending the facility under provisions of chapter 31; and

(2) The general rates established for medical services do not exceed the rates established by the Under Secretary for Health.

(c) VA may reimburse a rehabilitation facility for incidental medical services provided during a veteran's program at the facility.
