##### 836.213-70 Notice to proceed. #####

(a) The contracting officer must provide construction contractors with a written notice to proceed for the work. A notice to proceed will normally be sent only after the contractor has provided performance and payment bonds or payment protection and the completed contract forms, where applicable, and the contracting officer has accepted them. If the urgency of the work or other proper reason requires the contractor to begin work immediately, the contracting officer may include in the award letter a notice to proceed, with the reservation that payments are contingent upon receipt and approval of the required bonds or payment protection.

(b) If the contract provides for liquidated damages, the contracting officer must send the notice to proceed by certified mail, return receipt requested, or any other method that provides signed evidence of receipt.

(c) If the contract does not provide for liquidated damages, certified mail is not required. In notices to proceed for these contracts, the contracting officer must establish a date for completion that takes into consideration the time required for the notice to arrive by regular mail.

(d) At the time the notice to proceed is sent to the contractor, the contracting officer must furnish a copy to the resident engineer or the Chief, Engineering Service.

(e) The contracting officer must file a copy of the notice to proceed with copy A of the contract.
