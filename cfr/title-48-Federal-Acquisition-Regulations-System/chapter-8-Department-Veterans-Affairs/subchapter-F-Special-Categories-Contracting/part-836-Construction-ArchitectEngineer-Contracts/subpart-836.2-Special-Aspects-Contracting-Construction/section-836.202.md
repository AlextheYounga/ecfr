##### 836.202 Specifications. #####

(a) The procedures described in part 811 are applicable to construction specifications.

(b) During the design stage, contract architect-engineers must not use “brand name or equal” or other restrictive specifications without the prior written approval of the contracting officer. The contracting officer must inform prospective architect-engineers of this requirement during the negotiation phase, prior to award of a contract for design.

(c) If VA has determined that only one product will meet the Government's minimum needs and VA will not allow the submission of “equal” products, the contracting officer must include the clause found at 852.236-90, Restriction on Submission and Use of Equal Products, in the solicitation and complete the clause by listing the items to which the clause applies. This clause places bidders on notice that the “brand name or equal” provisions of the clause found at FAR 52.236-5, Materials and Workmanship, and any other provision that may authorize the submission of an “equal” product, will not apply to the specific items listed.
