##### 837.7002 List of qualified funeral directors. #####

Contracting officers will establish, in coordination with cognizant Chief, Medical Administration Service (MAS) personnel or other personnel designated by the facility director to perform these functions, a list of funeral directors capable of performing the burial services specified in 837.7003. The contracting officer will attempt to establish a commitment to perform these services within the statutory limitation of $300 (see 38 U.S.C. 2302). Each funeral director must be fully licensed in the jurisdiction in which the business operates. If there has been no prior experience with the funeral director that would ensure the adequacy of the funeral director's services and casket, arrangements will be made before contract negotiation to inspect the premises and the casket to be provided, as well as to check with the local business bureau and/or Chamber of Commerce.
