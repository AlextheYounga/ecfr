(a) When a veteran dies while receiving care in a VA health care facility or in a non-VA institution at VA's expense, and the decedent's remains are unclaimed, the Chief, MAS, or the person designated by the facility director to perform these functions, will forward to the HCA a properly executed VA form 10-2065, Funeral Arrangements, requesting that funeral and burial services for the deceased be procured.

(b) The contracting officer will enter into negotiations with local funeral directors to procure a complete funeral and burial service within the statutory allowance of $300. The purchase order must list the specific services to be provided. The services must consist of the following:

(1) Preparation of the body, embalming.

(2) Clothing.

(3) Casket. (The casket, at a minimum, must be constructed from thick, strong particle board and must be of sufficient strength to support the weight of an adult human body. Cardboard or press paper or similar materials are not acceptable.)

(4) The securing of all necessary permits.

(5) Ensuring that a United States flag (provided the funeral director in accordance with M-1, Part I, paragraph 14.40) accompanies the casket to the place of burial.

(c) An additional allowance for transportation of the body to the place of burial is provided in 38 U.S.C. 2308. This allowance will cover the transportation cost of shipment of the body by common carrier or by hearse from the VA facility to the funeral home and to the place of burial, any charges for an outside shipping box, and the charges for securing all necessary permits for removal or shipment of the body. These costs are not chargeable against the $300 allowance.

(d) In accordance with M-1, Part I, paragraph 14.37, the contracting officer will designate the Chief, MAS, or the person designated by the facility director to perform these functions, to be responsible for the medical inspection of the mortuary services performed and inspection of the merchandise furnished. This designee will also be responsible for certifying receipt on the receiving report.

(e) The HCA will assist the Chief, MAS, or the person designated by the facility director to perform these functions, in developing the local procedures specified in M-1, Part I, paragraph 14.37c. (38 U.S.C. 2302, 2303, and 2308)
