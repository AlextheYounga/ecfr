##### 352.219-70 Mentor-Protégé Program. #####

As prescribed in HHSAR 319.270-1(a), the Contracting Officer shall insert the following provision:

Mentor-Protégé Program (DEC 2015)

(a) Large business prime contractors serving as mentors in the HHS Mentor-Protégé Program are eligible for HHS subcontracting plan credit, and shall submit a copy of their HHS Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU)-approved mentor-protégé agreements as part of their offers. The amount of credit provided by the Contracting Officer to a mentor firm for protégé firm developmental assistance costs shall be calculated on a dollar for dollar basis and reported by the mentor firm in the Summary Subcontract Report via the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) at *www.esrs.gov*. The mentor firm and protégé firm shall submit to the Contracting Officer a signed joint statement agreeing on the dollar value of the developmental assistance the mentor firm provided. (For example, a mentor firm would report a $10,000 subcontract awarded to a protégé firm and provision of $5,000 of developmental assistance as $15,000 of subcontracting plan credit.) The mentor firm may use this additional credit towards attaining its subcontracting plan participation goal under this contract.

(b) The program consists of—

(1) *Mentor firms*—large businesses that:

(i) Demonstrate the interest, commitment, and capability to provide developmental assistance to small business protégé firms; and

(ii) Have a Mentor-Protégé agreement approved by HHS' OSDBU;

(2) *Protégé firms*—firms that:

(i) Seek developmental assistance;

(ii) Qualify as small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or woman-owned small businesses; and

(iii) Have a Mentor-Protégé agreement approved by HHS' OSDBU; and

(3) *Mentor-Protégé agreements*—joint agreements, approved by HHS' OSDBU, which detail the specific terms, conditions, and responsibilities of the mentor-protégé relationship.
