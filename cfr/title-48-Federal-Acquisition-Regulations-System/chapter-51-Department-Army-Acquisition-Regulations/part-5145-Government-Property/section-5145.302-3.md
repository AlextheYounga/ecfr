(S-90)(1) When it is determined that contractor use of existing Government facilities, other than special use property, in the performance of installation support services contracts, is in the best interest of the Government, the Government facilities will be offered to a contractor for use in the performance of the Government contract. Facilities provided to a contractor under this authority will not be replaced by the Government when they can no longer be used by the contractor. Nevertheless, it will be the contractor's responsibility to continue performance in accordance with the terms of the contract.

(2)(i) New facilities shall not be purchased in order to provide them to contractors. Prior to offering existing facilities under this authority, a contracting officer shall make a written determination, based on the detailed justification provided by the approving officials and program/project manager, that such use is in the best interest of the Government. The written determination shall be kept in the contract file.

(ii) Existing facilities offered for contractor use will be offered to all bidders/offerors for their consideration in the preparation of their bids and offers. Bidders/offerors may choose to use any or all of the facilities offered.

(3) When it is determined that contractor use of special use property in the performance of installation support services contracts is in the best interest of the Government, such property will be provided. It will be accounted for and managed under the appropriate Government property clause. For example, FAR 52.245-2 for fixed-price contracts or FAR 52.245-5 for cost-reimbursement contracts and any appropriate provision from FAR 52.245-11, Facilities Use Clause.
