##### 536.213-370 Bids that include alternates. #####

(a) The base bid must include all features essential to a sound and adequate building design. If it appears that funds available for a project may be insufficient to include all desired features in the base bid, you may issue a solicitation for a base bid and include one or more alternates in the order of priority. Use alternates only if they are clearly justified and involve substantial amounts of work in relation to the base bid. Their use must be limited and should involve only “add” alternates.

(b) Before opening bids that include alternates, determine, and record in the contract file, the amount of funds available for the project. The amount recorded must be announced at the beginning of the bid opening. The amount is the controlling factor in determining the low bidder. This amount may be increased later when determining the alternate items to award to the low bidder if the following condition is met: the award amount of the base bid plus the combination of alternate items does not exceed the amount offered for the base bid and the same combination of alternate items by any other responsible bidder whose bid conforms to the solicitation. This requirement prevents the displacement of the low bidder by manipulating the alternates to be used.
