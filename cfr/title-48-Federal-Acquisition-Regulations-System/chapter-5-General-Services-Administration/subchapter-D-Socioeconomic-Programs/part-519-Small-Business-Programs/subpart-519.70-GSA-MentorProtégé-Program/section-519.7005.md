##### 519.7005 Measurement of program success. #####

The overall success of the GSA Mentor-Protégé Program encompassing all participating mentors and protégés will be measured by the extent to which it results in:

(a) An increase in the number, dollar value, and percentage of subcontracts awarded to protégés by mentor firms under GSA contracts since the date of entry into the Program. The baseline that demonstrates an increase is determined by comparing the number and total dollar amount of subcontract awards made to the identified protégé firm(s) during the two preceding fiscal years (if any) that are listed in application;

(b) An increase in the number and dollar value of contract and subcontract awards (including percentage of subcontract awards) to protégé firms since the date of the protégé's entry into the Program (under GSA contracts and contracts awarded by other Federal agencies);

(c) An increase in the number and dollar value of subcontracts awarded to a protégé firm by its mentor firm; and

(d) An increase in subcontracting with protégé firms in industry categories where they have not traditionally participated within the mentor firm's activity (*i.e.*, the protégé is expanding its field of expertise or is increasing its opportunities in areas where it has not traditionally performed).

(e) Assessments of the semi-annual reports submitted by the mentors and “Lessons Learned” evaluation submitted by the mentors and protégés to the GSA Mentor-Protégé Program Manager.
