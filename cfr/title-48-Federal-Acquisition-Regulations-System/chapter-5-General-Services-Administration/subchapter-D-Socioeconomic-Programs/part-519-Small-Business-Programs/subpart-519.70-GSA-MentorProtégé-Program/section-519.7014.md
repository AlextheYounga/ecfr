##### 519.7014 Internal controls. #####

(a) The GSA Mentor-Protégé Program Manager will manage the Program. Internal controls will be established by the Mentor-Protégé Program Manager to achieve the stated Program objectives (by serving as checks and balances against undesired actions or consequences) such as:

(1) Reviewing and evaluating mentor Applications for realism, validity and accuracy of provided information;

(2) Monitoring each Mentor-Protégé Agreement by reviewing semi-annual progress reports submitted by mentors and protégés on protégé development to measure protégé progress against the master plan contained in the approved Agreement;

(3) Monitoring milestones in the Agreement (see 519.7010); and

(4) Evaluating “Lessons Learned” submitted by the Mentor and the Protégé as required by section 519.7013 to improve the GSA Mentor-Protégé Program.

(b)(1) GSA has the authority to exclude mentor or protégé firms from participating in the GSA Program.

(2) GSA may rescind approval of an existing Mentor-Protégé Agreement if it determines that such action is in GSA's best interest. The rescission shall be in writing and sent to the Mentor and protégé after approval by the Director of OSBU. Rescission of an Agreement does not change the terms of any subcontract between the Mentor and the Protégé.

(3) Exclusion from the Program does not constitute a termination of the subcontract between the mentor and the protégé.
