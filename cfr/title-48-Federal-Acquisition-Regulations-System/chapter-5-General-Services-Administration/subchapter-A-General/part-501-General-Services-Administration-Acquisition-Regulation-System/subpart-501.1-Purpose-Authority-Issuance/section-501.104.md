##### 501.104 Applicability. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 33859, July 16, 2019.

(a) *General.* The GSAR applies to contracts for suppliers or services, including construction.

(b) *Acquisition of leasehold interests in real property.* Part 570 establishes rules for the acquisition of leasehold interests in real property. Other provisions of 48 CFR chapter 5 (GSAR) do not apply to leases of real property unless specifically cross-reference in part 570.

(c) *Relationship to state.* Some GSAR rules implement and interpret laws and other authorities affecting procurement. A GSAR rule specifically directed by statute has the force and effect of law.

(d) *GSAR/FAR Relationship.* The GSAR may deviate from the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) if authorized. If the GSAR does not implement the FAR, the FAR alone governs.
