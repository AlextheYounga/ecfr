##### 501.404 Class deviations. #####

(a) A class deviation affects more than one contract action. A deviation for any solicitation that will result in multiple awards or any solicitation under the multiple award Federal Supply Schedule program is considered to be a class deviation. Each award under such a solicitation is considered an individual contract action.

(1) A class deviation to the FAR must be forwarded by the cognizant HCA to GSA's SPE for approval. Prior to approving a class deviation to the FAR, the SPE will consult with the Chairman of the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council (CAAC) in accordance with FAR 1.404(a)(1).

(2) A class deviation to the GSAR must be forwarded by the cognizant HCA to GSA's SPE for approval.

(3) When an HCA knows that a proposed class deviation will be required on a permanent basis, the HCA should propose or recommend an appropriate FAR and/or GSAR revision.

(b) If GSA delegates authority to another agency and requires compliance with the GSAR as a condition of the delegation, the HCA in the agency receiving the delegation may approve class deviations from the GSAR unless the agency head receiving the delegation designates another official.

(c) Send a copy of each deviation to GSA's SPE (MV).

(d) A request for class deviations must be supported by statements that fully describe the need for and the nature of the deviation.

(e) Class deviations from the GSAR:

(1) Expire in 12 months if not extended.

(2) May be rescinded earlier by GSA's SPE or by officials designated under paragraph (a) of this section without prejudice to any action taken previously.
