##### 501.402 Policy. #####

Uniformity is a goal of GSA's Acquisition Regulation System. Despite this desire for uniformity, a contracting activity may take any of the following actions:

(a) Develop and test new procedures and techniques.

(b) Adopt alternate procedures in the public interest for unique programmatic or managerial requirements

(c) Deviate from a regulatory provision implementing a statutory requirement provided the deviation does not violate the underlying statute. Deviations must not be used to defeat the FAR and GSAR approval requirements.
