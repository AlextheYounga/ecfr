*Commercial supplier agreements* means terms and conditions customarily offered to the public by vendors of supplies or services that meets the definition of “commercial products and commercial services” set forth in FAR 2.101 and intended to create a binding legal obligation on the end user.

The term applies—

(a) Regardless of the format or style of the document. For example, a commercial supplier agreement may be styled as standard terms of sale or lease, Terms of Service (TOS), End User License Agreement (EULA), or another similar legal instrument or agreement, and may be presented as part of a proposal or quotation responding to a solicitation for a contract or order;

For example, a commercial supplier agreement may be presented as one or more paper documents or may appear on a computer or other electronic device screen during a purchase, software installation, other product delivery, registration for a service, or another transaction.
