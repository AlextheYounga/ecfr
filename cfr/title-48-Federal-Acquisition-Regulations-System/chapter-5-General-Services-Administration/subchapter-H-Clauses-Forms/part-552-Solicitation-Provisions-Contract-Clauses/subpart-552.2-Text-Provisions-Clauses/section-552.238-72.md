Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 17041, Apr. 23, 2019.

As prescribed in 538.273(a)(3), insert the following clause:

Identification of Products That Have Environmental Attributes (SEP 2003)

(a) Several laws, Executive orders, and Agency directives require Federal buyers to purchase products that are less harmful to the environment, when they are life cycle cost-effective (*see* FAR Subpart 23.7). The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) requires contractors to highlight environmental products under Federal Supply Service schedule contracts in various communications media (e.g., publications and electronic formats).

(b) *Definitions.* As used in this clause -

*Energy-efficient product* means a product that -

(1) Meets Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Agency criteria for use of the ENERGY STAR ® trademark label; or

(2) Is in the upper 25 percent of efficiency for all similar products as designated by the Department of Energy's Federal Energy Management Program.

*GSA Advantage!* is an on-line shopping mall and ordering system that provides customers with access to products and services under GSA contracts.

*Other environmental attributes* refers to product characteristics that provide environmental benefits, excluding recovered materials and energy and water efficiency. Several examples of these characteristics are biodegradable, recyclable, reduced pollutants, ozone safe, and low volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

*Post-consumer material* means a material or finished product that has served its intended use and has been discarded for disposal or recovery, having completed its life as a consumer item. Post-consumer material is part of the broader category of “recovered material.” The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed a list of EPA-designated products in their Comprehensive Procurement Guidelines (CPGs) to provide Federal agencies with purchasing recommendations on specific products in a Recovered Materials Advisory Notice (RMAN). The RMAN contains recommended recovered and post-consumer material content levels for the specific products designated by EPA (40 CFR part 247 and *http://www.epa.gov/cpg/*).

*Recovered materials* means waste materials and by-products recovered or diverted from solid waste, but the term does not include those materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process (Executive Order 13101 and 42 U.S.C. 6903(19) and *http://www.epa.gov/cpg/*). For paper and paper products, see the definition at FAR 11.301 (42 U.S.C. 6962(h)).

*Remanufactured* means factory rebuilt to original specifications.

*Renewable energy* means energy produced by solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass power.

*Renewable energy technology* means -

(1) Technologies that use renewable energy to provide light, heat, cooling, or mechanical or electrical energy for use in facilities or other activities; or

(2) The use of integrated whole-building designs that rely upon renewable energy resources, including passive solar design.

(c)(1) The offeror must identify products that -

(i) Are compliant with the recovered and post-consumer material content levels recommended in the Recovered Materials Advisory Notices (RMANs) for EPA-designated products in the CPG program (*http://www.epa.gov/cpg/*);

(ii) Contain recovered materials that either do not meet the recommended levels in the RMANs or are not EPA-designated products in the CPG program (*see* FAR 23.401 and *http://www.epa.gov/cpg/*);

(iii) Are energy-efficient, as defined by either ENERGY STAR ® and/or FEMP's designated top 25th percentile levels (*see* ENERGY STAR ® at *http://www.energystar.gov/* and FEMP at *http://www.eere.energy.gov/femp/procurement/*);

(iv) Are water-efficient;

(v) Use renewable energy technology;

(vi) Are remanufactured; and

(vii) Have other environmental attributes.

(2) These identifications must be made in each of the offeror's following mediums:

(i) The offer itself.

(ii) Printed commercial catalogs, brochures, and pricelists.

(iii) Online product website.

(iv) Electronic data submission for GSA *Advantage!* submitted via GSA's Schedules Input Program (SIP) software or the Electronic Data Inter-change (EDI). Offerors can use the SIP or EDI methods to indicate environmental and other attributes for each product that is translated into respective icons in GSA *Advantage!.*

(d) An offeror, in identifying an item with an environmental attribute, must possess evidence or rely on a reasonable basis to substantiate the claim (*see* 16 CFR part 260, Guides for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims). The Government will accept an offeror's claim of an item's environmental attribute on the basis of -

(1) Participation in a Federal agency-sponsored program (e.g., the EPA and DOE ENERGY STAR ® product labeling program);

(2) Verification by an independent organization that specializes in certifying such claims; or

(3) Possession of competent and reliable evidence. For any test, analysis, research, study, or other evidence to be “competent and reliable,” it must have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by persons qualified to do so, using procedures generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results.
