Goals for Subcontracting Plan (JUN 2005)

(a) Maximum practicable utilization of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns as subcontractors is a matter of national interest with both social and economic benefits.

(1) The General Service Administration's (GSA's) commitment to ensuring that maximum practicable opportunity is provided to small, HUBZone small, small disdvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns to participate as subcontractors in the performance of this contract, consistent with its efficient performance, must be reflected in the offeror's subcontracting plan submitted pursuant to the clause of this contract at FAR 52.219-9, Small Business Subcontracting Plan.

(2) In addressing the eleven elements described at FAR 52.219-9(d), the offeror shall demonstrate that its subcontracting plan represents a creative and innovative program for involving small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns in performing this contract. An offeror submitting a commercial plan can demonstrate its commitment in providing maximum practicable opportunities through subcontracting opportunities it provides to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran owned small business concerns that relate to the offeror's production generally; *i.e.,* for both its commercial and Government business.

(3) The subcontracting plan shall include a description of the offeror's subcontracting strategies used in previous contracts and significant achievements, with an explanation of how this plan will build upon those earlier achievements. Additionally, the offeror shall demonstrate through its plan that it understands the small business subcontracting program's objectives, GSA's expectations, and is committed to taking those actions necessary to meet these goals or objectives.

(b) GSA believes that this contract provides significant opportunities for the use of small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns as subcontractors. Accordingly, it is anticipated that an acceptable subcontracting plan will contain at least the following goals:

|               Small Business                |\_\_ percent.|
|:--------------------------------------------|------------:|
|           HUBZone Small Business            |\_\_ percent.|
|        Small Disadvantaged Business         |\_\_ percent.|
|         Women-Owned Small Business          |\_\_ percent.|
|        Veteran-Owned Small Business         |\_\_ percent.|
|Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business|\_\_ percent.|

Note:

Target goals are expressed as a percentage of planned subcontracting dollars.

(c) In determining the acceptability of any subcontracting plan, the Contracting Officer will -

(1) Review the plan to verify that the offeror has demonstrated an understanding of the small business subcontracting program's objectives and GSA's expectations with respect to the programs and has included all the information, goals, and assurances required by FAR 52.219-9;

(2) Consider previous goals and achievements of contractors in the same industry;

(3) Consider information and potential sources obtained from agencies administering national and local preference programs and other advocacy groups in evaluating whether the goals stated in the plan adequately reflect the anticipated potential for subcontracting to small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns; and

(4) Review the offeror's description of its strategies, historical performance and significant achievements in placing subcontracts for the same or similar products or services with small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns. The offeror's description can apply to commercial as well as previous Government contracts.

(d) Failure to submit an acceptable subcontracting plan and/or correct deficiencies in a plan within the time specified by the Contracting Officer shall make the offeror ineligible for award.
