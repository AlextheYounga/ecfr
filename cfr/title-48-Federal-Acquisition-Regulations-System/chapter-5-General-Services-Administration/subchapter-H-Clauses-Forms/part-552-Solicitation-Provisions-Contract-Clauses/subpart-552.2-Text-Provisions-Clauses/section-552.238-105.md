Deliveries Beyond the Contractual Period—Placing of Orders (MAY 2019)

In accordance with Clause 552.238-113, Scope of Contract (Eligible Ordering Activities), this contract covers all requirements that may be ordered, as distinguished from delivered during the contract term. This is for the purpose of providing continuity of supply or operations by permitting ordering activities to place orders as requirements arise in the normal course of operations.
