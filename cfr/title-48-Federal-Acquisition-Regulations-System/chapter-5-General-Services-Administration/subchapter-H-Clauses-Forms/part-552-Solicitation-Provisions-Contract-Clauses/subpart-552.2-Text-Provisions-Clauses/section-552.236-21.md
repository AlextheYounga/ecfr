(b) Schedules on any contract drawing shall take precedence over conflicting information on that or any other contract drawing.

(c) On any of the drawings where a portion of the work is detailed or drawn out and the remainder is shown in outline, the parts detailed or drawn out shall apply also to all other like portions of the work.

(d) Where the word “similar” occurs on the drawings, it shall have a general meaning and not be interpreted as being identical, and all details shall be worked out in relation to their location and their connection with other parts of the work.

(e) Standard details or specification drawings are applicable when listed, bound with the specifications, noted on the drawings, or referenced elsewhere in the specifications.

(1) Where notes on the specification drawings indicate alterations, such alterations shall govern.

(2) In case of difference between standard details or specification drawings and the specifications, the specifications shall govern.

(3) In case of difference between the standard details or specification drawings and the drawings prepared specifically for this contract, the drawings prepared specifically for this contract shall govern.

(f) Different requirements within the contract documents shall be deemed inconsistent only if compliance with both cannot be achieved.

(g) Unless otherwise noted, the drawings shall be interpreted to provide for a complete construction, assembly, or installation of the work, without regard to the detail with which material components are shown in the drawings.
