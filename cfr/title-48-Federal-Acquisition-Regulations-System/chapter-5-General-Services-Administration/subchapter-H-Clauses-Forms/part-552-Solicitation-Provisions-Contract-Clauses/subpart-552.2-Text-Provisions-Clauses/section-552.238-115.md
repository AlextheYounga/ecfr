(6) Prior to the placement of an order that includes order-level materials, the Ordering Activity shall follow the procedures in FAR 8.404(h).

(A) One of these three quotes may include materials furnished by theContractor under paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) of FAR clause 52.212-4 Alternate I.

(B) If the Contractor cannot obtain three quotes, the Contractor shall maintain documentation of why three quotes could not be obtained to support their determination.

(C) A Contractor with an approved purchasing system, per FAR subpart 44.3, shall instead follow its purchasing system requirement and is exempt from the requirements in paragraphs (d)(7)(i)(A) and (B) of this clause.

(ii) The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer must make a determination that prices for all order-level materials are fair and reasonable. The Ordering Activity Contracting Officer may base this determination on a comparison of the quotes received in response to the task or delivery order solicitation or other relevant pricing information available.

(iii) If indirect costs are approved per paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(D)(2) of FAR clause 52.212-4 Alternate I), the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer must make a determination that all indirect costs approved for payment are fair and reasonable. Supporting data shall be submitted in a form acceptable to the Ordering Activity Contracting Officer.

(10) Order-level materials are exempt from the following clauses:

(i) 552.238-77 Submission and Distribution of Authorized Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) Price Lists.
