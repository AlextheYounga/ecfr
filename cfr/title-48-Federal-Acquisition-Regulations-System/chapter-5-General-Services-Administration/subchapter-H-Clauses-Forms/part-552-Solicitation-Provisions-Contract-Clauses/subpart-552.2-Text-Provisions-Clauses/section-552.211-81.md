(End of clause)

*Alternate I* (FEB 1996). If the contract will require shipment more than 45 calendar days after receipt of the order, the following paragraph should be added to the basic clause.

Each delivery order will specify that shipment is required no later than the number of days shown above. If such order also states that “Early Shipment is Precluded,” the Contractor agrees to make shipment no sooner than \_\_\_ calendar days after receipt of order. Earlier shipments may result in nonacceptance of the supplies at the delivery point at the time of arrival.

(*The second number to be inserted should be 15 calendar days less than the first number.*)
