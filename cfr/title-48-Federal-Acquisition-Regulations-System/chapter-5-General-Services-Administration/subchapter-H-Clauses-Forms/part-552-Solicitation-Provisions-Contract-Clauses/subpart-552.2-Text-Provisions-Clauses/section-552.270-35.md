*Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM)* means that—

(i) The Offeror has entered all mandatory information, including the unique entity identifier and the EFT indicator, if applicable, the Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14) into SAM;

(ii) The Offeror has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in SAM;
