This relationship shall be maintained through out the contract period. Any change in the Contractor's commercial pricing or discount arrangement applicable to the identified customer (or category of customers) which disturbs this relationship shall constitute a price reduction.

(c)(1) A price reduction shall apply to purchases under this contract if, after the date negotiations conclude, the Contractor -

(i) Revises the commercial catalog, pricelist, schedule or other document upon which contract award was predicated to reduce prices;

(ii) Grants more favorable discounts or terms and conditions than those contained in the commercial catalog, pricelist, schedule or other documents upon which contract award was predicated; or

(iii) Grants special discounts to the customer (or category of customers) that formed the basis of award, and the change disturbs the price/discount relationship of the Government to the customer (or category of customers) that was the basis of award.

(2) The Contractor shall offer the price reduction to the eligible ordering activity with the same effective date, and for the same time period, as extended to the commercial customer (or category of customers).

(2) To Federal agencies;

(3) Made to Eligible Ordering Activities identified in GSAR clause 552.238-78 when the order is placed under this contract (and the Eligible Ordering Activities identified in GSAR clause 552.238-78 is the agreed upon customer or category of customer that is the basis of award); or

(4) Caused by an error in quotation or billing, provided adequate documentation is furnished by the Contractor to the Contracting Officer.

(e) The Contractor may offer the Contracting Officer a voluntary Governmentwide price reduction at any time during the contract period.
