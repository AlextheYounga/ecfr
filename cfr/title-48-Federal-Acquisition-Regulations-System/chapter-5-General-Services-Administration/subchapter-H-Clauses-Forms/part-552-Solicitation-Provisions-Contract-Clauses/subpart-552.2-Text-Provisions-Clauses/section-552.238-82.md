As prescribed in 538.273(d)(6), insert the following clause:

Modifications (Federal Supply Schedules) (MAY 2019)

(a) *General.* The Contractor may request a contract modification by submitting a request to the Contracting Officer for approval, except as noted in paragraph (d) of this clause. At a minimum, every request shall describe the proposed change(s) and provide the rationale for the requested change(s).

(b) *Types of modifications* - (1) *Additional items/additional SINs.* When requesting additions, the following information must be submitted:

(i) Information requested in paragraphs (1) and (2) of the Commercial Sales Practice Format to add SINs.

(ii) Discount information for the new items(s) or new SIN(s). Specifically, submit the information requested in paragraphs 3 through 5 of the Commercial Sales Practice Format. If this information is the same as the initial award, a statement to that effect may be submitted instead.

(iii) Information about the new item(s) or the item(s) under the new SIN(s) must be submitted in accordance with the request for proposal.

(iv) Delivery time(s) for the new item(s) or the item(s) under the new SIN(s) must be submitted in accordance with the request for proposal.

(v) Production point(s) for the new item(s) or the item(s) under the new SIN(s) must be submitted if required by FAR 52.215-6, Place of Performance.

(vi) Hazardous Material information (if applicable) must be submitted as required by FAR 52.223-3 (Alternate I), Hazardous Material Identification and Material Safety Data.

(2) *Deletions.* The Contractors shall provide an explanation for the deletion. The Government reserves the right to reject any subsequent offer of the same item or a substantially equal item at a higher price during the same contract period, if the contracting officer finds the higher price to be unreasonable when compared with the deleted item.

(3) *Price reduction.* The Contractor shall indicate whether the price reduction falls under the item (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (c)(1) of the Price Reductions clause at 552.238-81. If the Price reduction falls under item (i), the Contractor shall transmit a copy of the dated commercial price list. If the price reduction falls under item (ii) or (iii), the Contractor shall transmit a copy of the applicable price list(s), bulletins or letters or customer agreements which outline the effective date, duration, terms and conditions of the price reduction.

(c) *Effective dates.* The effective date of any modification is the date specified in the modification, except as otherwise provided in the Price Reductions clause at 552.238-81.

(d) *Electronic file updates.* The Contractor shall update electronic file submissions to reflect all modifications. For additional items or SINs, the Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's approval before transmitting changes. Contract modifications will not be made effective until the Government receives the electronic file updates. The Contractor may transmit price reductions, item deletions, and corrections without prior approval. However, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer as set forth in the Price Reductions clause at 552.238-81.

(e) *Amendments to paper Federal Supply Schedule Price Lists.* (1) The Contractor must provide supplements to its paper price lists, reflecting the most current changes. The Contractor may either:

(i) Distribute a supplemental paper Federal Supply Schedule Price List within 15 workdays after the effective date of each modification.

(ii) Distribute quarterly cumulative supplements. The period covered by a cumulative supplement is at the discretion of the Contractor, but may not exceed three calendar months from the effective date of the earliest modification. For example, if the first modification occurs in February, the quarterly supplement must cover February-April, and every three month period after. The Contractor must distribute each quarterly cumulative supplement within 15 workdays from the last day of the calendar quarter.

(2) At a minimum, the Contractor shall distribute each supplement to those ordering activities that previously received the basic document. In addition, the Contractor shall submit two copies of each supplement to the Contracting Officer and one copy to the FSS Schedule Information Center.
