##### 552.270-2 Historic Preference. #####

As prescribed in 570.702, insert the following provision:

Historic Preference (SEP 2004)

(a) The Government will give preference to offers of space in historic properties following this hierarchy of consideration:

(1) Historic properties within historic districts.

(2) Non-historic developed and non-historic undeveloped sites within historic districts.

(3) Historic properties outside of historic districts.

(b) *Definitions.* (1) *Determination of eligibility* means a decision by the Department of the Interior that a district, site, building, structure or object meets the National Register criteria for evaluation although the property is not formally listed in the National Register (36 CFR 60.3(c)).

(2) *Historic district* means a geographically definable area, urban or rural, possessing a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united by past events or aesthetically by plan or physical development. A district may also comprise individual elements separated geographically but linked by association or history (36 CFR 60.3(d)). The historic district must be included in or be determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.

(3) *Historic property* means any pre-historic or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in or been determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places maintained by the Secretary of the Interior (36 CFR 800.16(l)).

(4) *National Register of Historic Places* means the National Register of districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects significant in American history, architecture, archeology, engineering and culture that the Secretary of the Interior is authorized to expand and maintain under the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 60.1).

(c) The offer of space must meet the terms and conditions of this solicitation. The Contracting Officer has discretion to accept alternatives to certain architectural characteristics and safety features defined elsewhere in this solicitation to maintain the historical integrity of an historic building, such as high ceilings and wooden floors, or to maintain the integrity of an historic district, such as setbacks, floor-to-ceiling heights, and location and appearance of parking.

(d) When award will be based on the lowest price technically acceptable source selection process, the Government will give a price evaluation preference, based on the total annual square foot (ANSI/BOMA Office Area) cost to the Government, to historic properties as follows:

(1) First to suitable historic properties within historic districts, a 10 percent price preference.

(2) If no suitable historic property within an historic district is offered, or the 10 percent preference does not result in such property being the lowest price technically acceptable offer, the Government will give a 2.5 percent price preference to suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts.

(3) If no suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped site within an historic district is offered, or the 2.5 percent preference does not result in such property being the lowest price technically acceptable offer, the Government will give a 10 percent price preference to suitable historic properties outside of historic districts.

(4) Finally, if no suitable historic property outside of historic districts is offered, no historic price preference will be given to any property offered.

(e) When award will be based on the best value tradeoff source selection process, which permits tradeoffs among price and non-price factors, the Government will give a price evaluation preference, based on the total annual square foot (ANSI/BOMA Office Area) cost to the Government, to historic properties as follows:

(1) First to suitable historic properties within historic districts, a 10 percent price preference.

(2) If no suitable historic property within a historic district is offered or remains in the competition, the Government will give a 2.5 percent price preference to suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped sites within historic districts.

(3) If no suitable non-historic developed or undeveloped site within an historic district is offered or remains in the competition, the Government will give a 10 percent price preference to suitable historic properties outside of historic districts.

(4) Finally, if no suitable historic property outside of historic districts is offered, no historic price preference will be given to any property offered.

(f) The Government will compute price evaluation preferences by reducing the price(s) of the offerors qualifying for a price evaluation preference by the applicable percentage provided in this provision. The price evaluation preference will be used for price evaluation purposes only. The Government will award a contract in the amount of the actual price(s) proposed by the successful offeror and accepted by the Government.

(g) To qualify for a price evaluation preference, offerors must provide satisfactory documentation in their offer that their property qualifies as one of the following:

(1) An historic property within an historic district.

(2) A non-historic developed or undeveloped site within an historic district.

(3) An historic property outside of an historic district.
