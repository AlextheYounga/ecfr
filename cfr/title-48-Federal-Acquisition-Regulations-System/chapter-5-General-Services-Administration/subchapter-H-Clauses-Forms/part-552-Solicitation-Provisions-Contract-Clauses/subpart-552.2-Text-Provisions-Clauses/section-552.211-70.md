As prescribed in 511.404(b), insert the following clause:

Substantial Completion (MAR 2019)

(a) *General.* (1) For the purposes of FAR 52.211-10, Commencement, Prosecution and Completion of Work, and FAR 52.211-12, Liquidated Damages-Construction, the work shall be deemed complete when it is “substantially complete.”

(2) There may be different completion dates required for different phases or portions of the work, as established in the contract. However, the work shall be deemed “substantially complete” if and only if the Contractor has completed the work and related contract obligations in accordance with the contract documents, such that the Government may enjoy the intended access, occupancy, possession, and use of the entire work without impairment due to incomplete or deficient work, and without interference from the Contractor's completion of remaining work or correction of deficiencies in completed work.

(3) In no event shall the work be deemed “substantially complete” if all fire and life safety systems are not tested and accepted by the authority having jurisdiction, where such acceptance is required under the contract.

(4) Unless otherwise specifically noted, or otherwise clear from context, all references in the contract to “acceptance” shall refer to issuance of a written determination of substantial completion by the Contracting Officer.

(b) *Notice of Substantial Completion.* (1) With reasonable advance notice, the Contractor shall submit to the Contracting Officer a written proposal recommending a substantial completion date.

(2) If the Contracting Officer takes exception to the notice of substantial completion, the Contractor shall be entitled to a written notice of conditions precluding determination of substantial completion. The Contractor shall only be entitled to an extension of time to address such conditions if, and to the extent that, the Contracting Officer provides notice of such conditions more than 30 calendar days after receipt of the notice of substantial completion.

(c) *Acceptance of Substantial Completion.* (1) The Contracting Officer shall conduct inspections and make a determination of substantial completion within a reasonable time.

(2) Substantial Completion shall be established by the Contracting Officer's issuance of a written determination specifying the date upon which the work is substantially complete.

(d) *Contract Completion.* (1) The Contract is complete if and only if the Contractor has completed all work and related contract obligations, corrected all deficiencies and all punch list items, and complied with all conditions for final payment.

(2) The Contractor shall not be entitled to final payment or release of any retainage held by the Government until after contract completion. If the Contractor does not achieve contract completion within the time required by this contract, the Government shall be entitled, after providing notice to the Contractor, to complete any work remaining unfinished. The Contractor shall be liable to the Government for all costs incurred by the Government to complete such work.
