As prescribed in 538.273(b)(2), insert the following provision:

Introduction of New Supplies/Services (INSS) (MAY 2019)

(a) *Definition.*

*Introduction of New Supplies/Services Special Item Number (INSS SIN)* means a new or improved supply or service—within the scope of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), but not currently available under any Federal Supply Schedule contract—that provides a new service, function, task, or attribute that may provide a more economical or efficient means for ordering activities to accomplish their missions. It may significantly improve an existing supply or service. It may be a supply or service existing in the commercial market, but not yet introduced to the Federal Government.

(b) Offerors are encouraged to introduce new or improved supplies or services via INSS SIN at any time by clearly identifying the INSS SIN item in the offer.

(c) The Contracting Officer has the sole discretion to determine whether a supply or service will be accepted as an INSS SIN item. The Contracting Officer will evaluate and process the offer and may perform a technical review. The INSS SIN provides temporary placement until the Contracting Officer formally categorizes the new supply or service.

(d) If the Contractor has an existing schedule contract, the Government may, at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer, modify the existing contract to include the INSS SIN item in accordance with 552.238-82, Modifications (Federal Supply Schedules).
