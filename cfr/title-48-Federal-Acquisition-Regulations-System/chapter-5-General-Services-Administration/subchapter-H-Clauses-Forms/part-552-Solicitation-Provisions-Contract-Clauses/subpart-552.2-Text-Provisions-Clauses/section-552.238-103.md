##### 552.238-103 Electronic Commerce. #####

As prescribed in 538.273(d)(27), insert the following clause:

Electronic Commerce (MAY 2019)

(a) *General background.* The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 requires the Government to evolve its acquisition process from one driven by paper to an expedited process based on electronic commerce/electronic data interchange (EC/EDI). EC/EDI encompasses more than merely automating manual processes and eliminating paper transactions. EC/EDI improves business processes (e.g. procurement, finance, logistics) into a fully electronic environment and fundamentally changes the way organizations operate.

(b) *Trading partners and Value-Added Networks (VAN's).*

(1) Within the electronic commerce architecture, electronic documents (e.g., orders, invoices, etc.) are carried between the Federal Government's procuring office and Contractors (now known as “trading partners”). These transactions are carried by commercial telecommunications companies called Value-Added Networks (VAN's).

(2) EDI can be performed using commercially available hardware, software, and telecommunications. The selection of a VAN is a business decision Contractors must make. There are many different VAN's which provide a variety of electronic services and different pricing strategies. If the VAN only provides communications services, you may also need a software translation package.

(c) *Registration instructions.* To perform EDI with the Government, Contractors shall register as a trading partner. Contractors will provide regular business information, banking information, and EDI capabilities to all agencies in this single registration. A central repository of all trading partners is the Systems for Award Management (SAM) *http://www.sam.gov.* Contractors shall follow the instructions on the SAM website regarding how to register for EDI.

(d) *Implementation conventions.* All EDI transactions must comply with the Federal Implementation Conventions (ICs). The ICs are available on a registry maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). It is accessible via the INTERNET at *http://www.nist.gov/itl.* ICs are available for common business documents such as Purchase Order, Price Sales Catalog, Invoice, Request for Quotes, etc.

(e) *Additional information.* GSA has additional information available for Contractors who are interested in using EC/EDI on its website, *www.gsa.gov*.

(f) *GSA Advantage!®.* (1) GSA Advantage!® uses electronic commerce to receive catalogs, invoices and text messages; and to send purchase orders, application advice, and functional acknowledgments. GSA Advantage!® enables customers to:

(i) Perform database searches across all contracts by manufacturer; manufacturer's model/part number; Contractor; and generic supply categories.

(ii) Generate EDI delivery orders to Contractors, generate EDI delivery orders from the Federal Supply Service to Contractors, or download files to create their own delivery orders.

(iii) Use the credit card.

(2) GSA Advantage!® may be accessed via the GSA Home Page. The internet address is: *http://www.gsa.gov.*
