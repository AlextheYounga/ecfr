As prescribed in 538.273(d)(13), insert the following clause:

Deliveries to the U.S. Postal Service (MAY 2019)

(a) *Applicability.* This clause applies to orders placed for the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) and accepted by the Contractor for the delivery of supplies to a USPS facility (consignee).

(b) *Mode/method of transportation.* Unless the Contracting Officer grants a waiver of this requirement, any shipment that meets the USPS requirements for mailability (*i.e.,* 70 pounds or less, combined length and girth not more than 108 inches, etc.) delivery shall be accomplished via the use of the USPS. Other commercial services shall not be used, but this does not preclude the Contractor from making delivery by the use of the Contractor's own vehicles.

(c) *Time of delivery.* Notwithstanding the required time for delivery to destination as may be specified elsewhere in this contract, if shipments under this clause are mailed not later than five (5) calendar days before the required delivery date, delivery shall be deemed to have been made timely.
