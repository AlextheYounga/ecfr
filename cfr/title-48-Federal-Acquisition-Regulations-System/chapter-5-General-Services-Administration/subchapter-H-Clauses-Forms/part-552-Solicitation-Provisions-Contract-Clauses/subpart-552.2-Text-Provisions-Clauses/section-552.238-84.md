##### 552.238-84 Discounts for Prompt Payment. #####

As prescribed in 538.273(d)(8), insert the following clause:

Discounts for Prompt Payment (MAY 2019)

(a) Discounts for early payment (hereinafter referred to as “discounts” or “the discount”) will be considered in evaluating the relationship of the Offeror's concessions to the Government vis-a-vis the Offeror's concessions to its commercial and Federal non-schedule customers, but only to the extent indicated in this clause.

(b) Discounts will not be considered to determine the low Offeror in the situation described in the “Offers on Identical Products” provision of this solicitation.

(c) Uneconomical discounts will not be considered as meeting the criteria for award established by the Government. In this connection, a discount will be considered uneconomical if the annualized rate of return for earning the discount is lower than the “value of funds” rate established by the Department of the Treasury and published quarterly in the Federal Register. The “value of funds” rate applied will be the rate in effect on the date specified for the receipt of offers.

(d) Discounts for early payment may be offered either in the original offer or on individual invoices submitted under the resulting contract. Discounts offered will be taken by the ordering activity if payment is made within the discount period specified.

(e) Discounts that are included in offers become a part of the resulting contracts and are binding on the Contractor for all orders placed under the contract. Discounts offered only on individual invoices will be binding on the Contractor only for the particular invoice on which the discount is offered.

(f) In connection with any discount offered for prompt payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the date on which an electronic funds transfer was made.
