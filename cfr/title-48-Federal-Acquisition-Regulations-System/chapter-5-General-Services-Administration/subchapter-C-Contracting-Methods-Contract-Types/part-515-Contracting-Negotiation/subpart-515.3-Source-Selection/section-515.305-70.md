For proposals submitted in response to GAS solicitation no. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, I agree to the following:

(a) To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest exists that may either:

(1) Diminish my capacity to impartially review the proposals submitted.

(2) Or result in a biased opinion or unfair advantage.

(b) In making the above statement, I have considered all the following factors that might place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the evaluation proceedings:

(1) All my stocks, bonds, other outstanding financial interests or commitments.

(2) All my employment arrangements (past, present, and under consideration).

(3) As far as I know, all financial interests and employment arrangements of my spouse, minor children, and other members of my immediate household.

(c) I have read and understand the requirements of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR Part 2635) and Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the General Service Administration (5 CFR Part 6701).

(d) I have a continuing obligation to disclose any circumstances that may create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. If I learn of any such conflict, I will report it immediately to the Contracting Officer. I will perform no more duties related to evaluating proposals until I receive instructions on the matter.

(e) I will use proposal information for evaluation purposes only. I understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed on the proposal by the prospective contractor, prospective subcontractor, or the Government applies to any reproduction or abstracted information of the proposal.

(f) I will use my best efforts to safeguard proposal information physically. I will not disclose the contents of, nor release any information about, the proposals to anyone other than:

(2) Other individuals designed by the contracting Officer.

(g) After completing evaluation, I will return to the Government all copies of the proposals and any abstracts.
