##### 532.908 Contract clauses. #####

(a) GSA has a FAR deviation that allows this agency to use the clause at 552.232-1, Payments, in lieu of the clause at FAR 52.232-1, Payments.

(b) *General.* Before exercising the authority to modify the date for constructive acceptance or constructive approval of progress payments in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of the clause at FAR 52.232-25, Prompt Payment, the contracting officer must prepare a written justification explaining why a longer period is necessary. An official one level above the contracting officer must approve the justification. The time needed should be determined on a case-by-case basis, but the specified constructive acceptance period shall not exceed 30 days.

(c) *Stock, Special Order, and Schedules Programs.* (1) GSA has obtained a FAR Deviation to authorize payment within 10 days of receipt of a proper invoice. The authority applies only to:

(i) Orders placed by GSA under the referenced programs;

(ii) That include FAR 52.232-33, Mandatory Information for Electronic Funds Transfer Payment; and

(iii) For which the order is placed, and the contractor submits invoices, using EDI in accordance with the Trading Partner Agreement.

(2) If the contract is for commercial items and will include FAR 52.212-4, use the clause with its Alternate II. If the contract is not for commercial items, use the clause at 552.232-25, Prompt Payment, instead of FAR 52.232-25.
