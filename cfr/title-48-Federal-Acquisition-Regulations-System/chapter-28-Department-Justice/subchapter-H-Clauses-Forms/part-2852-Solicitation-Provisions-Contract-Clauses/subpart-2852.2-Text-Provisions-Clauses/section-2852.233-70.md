(b) A protest filed directly with the Department of Justice must:

(1) Indicate that it is a protest to the agency.

(2) Be filed with the Contracting Officer.

(3) State whether the protestor chooses to have the Contracting Officer or the Agency Protest Official decide the protest. If the protestor is silent on this matter, the Contracting Officer will decide the protest.

(4) Indicate whether the protestor prefers to make an oral or written presentation of arguments in support of the protest to the deciding official.

(e) The deciding official must conduct a scheduling conference with the protestor within five (5) days after the protest is filed. The scheduling conference will establish deadlines for oral or written arguments in support of the agency protest and for many officials to present information in response to the protest issues. The deciding official may hear oral arguments in support of the agency protest at the same time as the scheduling conference, depending on availability of the necessary parties.

(f) Oral conferences may take place either by telephone or in person. Other parties may attend at the discretion of the deciding official.

(g) The protestor has only one opportunity to support or explain the substance of its protest. Department of Justice procedures do not provide for any discovery. The deciding official may request additional information from either the agency or the protestor. The deciding official will resolve the protest through informal presentations or meetings to the maximum extent practicable.

(h) An interested party may rerpresent itself or be represented by legal counsel. The Department of Justice will not reimburse the protester for any legal fees related to the agency protest.

(i) The Department of Justice will stay award or suspend contract Performance in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). The stay or suspension unless over-ridden, remains in effect until the protest is decided, dismissed, or withdrawn.

(j) The deciding official will make a best effort to issue a decision on the protest within twenty (20) days after the filing date. The decision may be oral or written.

(k) The Department of Justice may dismiss or stay proceeding on an agency protest if a protest on the same or similar basis is filed with a protest forum outside the Department of Justice.
