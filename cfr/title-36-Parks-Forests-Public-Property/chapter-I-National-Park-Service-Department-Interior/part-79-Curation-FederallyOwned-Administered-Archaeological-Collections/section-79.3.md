Associated records that are prepared or assembled in connection with a Federal or federally authorized prehistoric or historic resource survey, excavation or other study are the property of the U.S. Government, regardless of the location of the resource.

(b) The regulations in this part apply to preexisting and new collections that meet the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
