(2) A person under 18 years of age must have permission of his parent or legal guardian before climbing above the normal high camps.

(3) A party traveling above the high camps must consist of a minimum of two persons unless prior permission for a solo climb has been obtained from the Superintendent. The Superintendent will consider the following points when reviewing a request for a solo climb: The weather prediction for the estimated duration of the climb, and the likelihood of new snowfall, sleet, fog , or hail along the route, the feasibility of climbing the chosen route because of normal inherent hazards, current route conditions, adequacy of equipment and clothing, and qualifying experience necessary for the route contemplated.

No person may camp in any location other than that designated in the permit for a given date.

(2) *Group size limitations.* Groups exceeding five persons must camp at a group site, but groups may not exceed twelve persons. The Superintendent may, however,

(i) Waive group size limitations on routes in the climbing zone when he determines that it will not result in environmental degradation; and
