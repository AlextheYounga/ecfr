##### § 1007.4 Preliminary processing of requests. #####

(a) *Scope of requests.* Unless a request clearly specifies otherwise, requests to the Presidio Trust may be presumed to seek only records of the Presidio Trust.

(b) *Records of other departments and agencies.* (1) If a requested record in the possession of the Presidio Trust originated with another Federal department or agency, the request shall be referred to that agency unless:

(i) The record is of primary interest to the Presidio Trust, for example, because it was developed or prepared pursuant to the Presidio Trust's regulations or request,

(ii) The Presidio Trust is in a better position than the originating agency to assess whether the record is exempt from disclosure, or

(iii) The originating agency is not subject to FOIA.

(2) A request for documents that were classified by another agency shall be referred to that agency.

(c) *Consultation with submitters of commercial and financial information.* (1) If a request seeks a record containing trade secrets or commercial or financial information submitted by a person outside of the Federal government, the Presidio Trust shall provide the submitter with notice of the request whenever:

(i) The submitter has made a good faith designation of the information as commercially or financially sensitive, or

(ii) The Presidio Trust has reason to believe that disclosure of the information may result in commercial or financial injury to the submitter.

(2) Where notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, such notification may be accomplished by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accomplish notification.

(3) The notice to the submitter shall afford the submitter a reasonable period within which to provide a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure. The submitter's statement shall explain the basis on which the information is claimed to be exempt under FOIA, including a specification of any claim of competitive or other business harm that would result from disclosure. The statement shall also include a certification that the information is confidential, has not been disclosed to the public by the submitter, and is not routinely available to the public from other sources.

(4) If a submitter's statement cannot be obtained within the time limit for processing the request under § 1007.6, the requester shall be notified of the delay as provided in § 1007.6(f).

(5) Notification to a submitter is not required if:

(i) The Presidio Trust determines, prior to giving notice, that the request for the record should be denied;

(ii) The information has previously been lawfully published or officially made available to the public;

(iii) Disclosure is required by a statute (other than FOIA) or regulation (other than this part);

(iv) Disclosure is clearly prohibited by a statute, as described in § 1007.2(c)(3);

(v) The information was not designated by the submitter as confidential when it was submitted, or a reasonable time thereafter, if the submitter was specifically afforded an opportunity to make such a designation; however, a submitter will be notified of a request for information that was not designated as confidential at the time of submission, or a reasonable time thereafter, if there is substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm;

(vi) The designation of confidentiality made by the submitter is obviously frivolous; or

(vii) The information was submitted to the Presidio Trust more than 10 years prior to the date of the request, unless the Presidio Trust has reason to believe that it continues to be confidential.

(6) If a requester brings suit to compel disclosure of information, the submitter of the information will be promptly notified.
