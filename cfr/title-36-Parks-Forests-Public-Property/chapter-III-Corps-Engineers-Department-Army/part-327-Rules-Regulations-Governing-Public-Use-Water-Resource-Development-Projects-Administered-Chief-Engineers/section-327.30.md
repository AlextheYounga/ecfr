(d) *Policy.* (1) It is the policy of the Chief of Engineers to protect and manage shorelines of all Civil Works water resource development projects under Corps jurisdiction in a manner which will promote the safe and healthful use of these shorelines by the public while maintaining environmental safeguards to ensure a quality resource for use by the public. The objectives of all management actions will be to achieve a balance between permitted private uses and resource protection for general public use. Public pedestrian access to and exit from these shorelines shall be preserved. For projects or portions of projects where Federal real estate interest is limited to easement title only, management actions will be appropriate within the limits of the estate acquired.

(2) Private shoreline uses may be authorized in designated areas consistent with approved use allocations specified in Shoreline Management Plans. Except to honor written commitments made prior to publication of this regulation, private shoreline uses are not allowed on water resource projects where construction was initiated after December 13, 1974, or on water resource projects where no private shoreline uses existed as of that date. Any existing permitted facilities on these projects will be grandfathered until the facilities fail to meet the criteria set forth in § 327.30(h).

(3) A Shoreline Management Plan, as described in § 327.30(e), will be prepared for each Corps project where private shoreline use is allowed. This plan will honor past written commitments. The plan will be reviewed at least once every five years and revised as necessary. Shoreline uses that do not interfere with authorized project purposes, public safety concerns, violate local norms or result in significant environmental effects should be allowed unless the public participation process identifies problems in these areas. If sufficient demand exists, consideration should be given to revising the shoreline allocations (e.g. increases/decreases). Maximum public participation will be encouraged as set forth in § 327.30(e)(6). Except to honor written commitments made prior to the publication of this regulation, shoreline management plans are not required for those projects where construction was initiated after December 13, 1974, or on projects not having private shoreline use as of that date. In that case, a statement of policy will be developed by the district commander to present the shoreline management policy. This policy statement will be subject to the approval of the division commander. For projects where two or more agencies have jurisdiction, the plan will be cooperatively prepared with the Corps as coordinator.

(4) Where commercial or other public launching and/or moorage facilities are not available within a reasonable distance, group owned mooring facilities may be allowed in Limited Development Areas to limit the proliferation of individual facilities. Generally only one permit will be necessary for a group owned mooring facility with that entity, if incorporated, or with one person from the organization designated as the permittee and responsible for all moorage spaces within the facility. No charge may be made for use of any permitted facility by others nor shall any commercial activity be engaged in thereon.

(5) The issuance of a private shoreline use permit does not convey any real estate or personal property rights or exclusive use rights to the permit holder. The public's right of access and use of the permit area must be maintained and preserved. Owners of permitted facilities may take necessary precautions to protect their property from theft, vandalism or trespass, but may in no way preclude the public right of pedestrian or vessel access to the water surface or public land adjacent to the facility.

(6) Shoreline Use Permits will only be issued to individuals or groups with legal right of access to public lands.

(e) *Shoreline Management Plan*—(1) *General.* The policies outlined in § 327.30(d) will be implemented through preparation of Shoreline Management Plans, where private shoreline use is allowed.

(2) *Preparation.* A Shoreline Management Plan is prepared as part of the Operational Management Plan. A moratorium on accepting applications for new permits may be placed in effect from the time an announcement of creation of a plan or formal revision of a plan is made until the action is completed.

(3) *Approval.* Approval of Shoreline Management Plans rests with division commanders. After approval, one copy of each project Shoreline Management Plan will be forwarded to HQUSACE (CECW-ON) WASH DC 20314-1000. Copies of the approved plan will also be made available to the public.

(4) *Scope and Format.* The Shoreline Management Plan will consist of a map showing the shoreline allocated to the uses listed in § 327.30(e)(6), related rules and regulations, a discussion of what areas are open or closed to specific activities and facilities, how to apply for permits and other information pertinent to the Corps management of the shoreline. The plan will be prepared in sufficient detail to ensure that it is clear to the public what uses are and are not allowed on the shoreline of the project and why. A process will be developed and presented in the Shoreline Management Plan that prescribes a procedure for review of activities requested but not specifically addressed by the Shoreline Management Plan.

(5) *Shoreline Allocation.* The entire shoreline will be allocated within the classifications below and delineated on a map. Any action, within the context of this rule, which gives a special privilege to an individual or group of individuals on land or water at a Corps project, that precludes use of those lands and waters by the general public, is considered to be private shoreline use. Shoreline allocations cover that land and/or water extending from the edge of the water and waterward with the exception of allocations for the purpose of vegetation modification which extends landward to the project boundary. These allocations should complement, but certainly not contradict, the land classifications in the project master plan. A map of sufficient size and scale to clearly display the shoreline allocations will be conspicuously displayed or readily available for viewing in the project administration office and will serve as the authoritative reference. Reduced or smaller scale maps may be developed for public dissemination but the information contained on these must be identical to that contained on the display map in the project administration office. No changes will be made to these maps except through the formal update process. District commanders may add specific constraints and identify areas having unique characteristics during the plan preparation, review, or updating process in addition to the allocation classifications described below.

(i) *Limited Development Areas.* Limited Development Areas are those areas in which private facilities and/or activities may be allowed consistent with § 327.30(h) and appendix A. Modification of vegetation by individuals may be allowed only following the issuance of a permit in accordance with appendix A. Potential low and high water conditions and underwater topography should be carefully evaluated before shoreline is allocated as Limited Development Area.

(ii) *Public Recreation Areas.* Public Recreation Areas are those areas designated for commercial concessionaire facilities, Federal, state or other similar public use. No private shoreline use facilities and/or activities will be permitted within or near designated or developed public recreation areas. The term “near” depends on the terrain, road system, and other local conditions, so actual distances must be established on a case by case basis in each project Shoreline Management Plan. No modification of land forms or vegetation by private individuals or groups of individuals is permitted in public recreation areas.

(iii) *Protected Shoreline Areas.* Protected Shoreline Areas are those areas designated to maintain or restore aesthetic, fish and wildlife, cultural, or other environmental values. Shoreline may also be so designated to prevent development in areas that are subject to excessive siltation, erosion, rapid dewatering, or exposure to high wind, wave, or current action and/or in areas in which development would interfere with navigation. No Shoreline Use Permits for floating or fixed recreation facilities will be allowed in protected areas. Some modification of vegetation by private individuals, such as clearing a narrow meandering path to the water, or limited mowing, may be allowed only following the issuance of a permit if the resource manager determines that the activity will not adversely impact the environment or physical characteristics for which the area was designated as protected. In making this determination the effect on water quality will also be considered.

(iv) *Prohibited Access Areas.* Prohibited Access Areas are those in which public access is not allowed or is restricted for health, safety or security reasons. These could include hazardous areas near dams, spillways, hydro-electric power stations, work areas, water intake structures, etc. No shoreline use permits will be issued in Prohibited Access Areas.

(6) *Public Participation.* District commanders will ensure public participation to the maximum practicable extent in Shoreline Management Plan formulation, preparation and subsequent revisions. This may be accomplished by public meetings, group workshops, open houses or other public involvement techniques. When master plan updates and preparation of the Shoreline Management Plans are concurrent, public participation may be combined and should consider all aspects of both plans, including shoreline allocation classifications. Public participation will begin during the initial formulation stage and must be broad-based to cover all aspects of public interest. The key to successful implementation is an early and continual public relations program. Projects with significant numbers of permits should consider developing computerized programs to facilitate exchange of information with permittees and to improve program efficiency. Special care will be taken to advise citizen and conservation organizations; Federal, state and local natural resource management agencies; Indian Tribes; the media; commercial concessionaires; congressional liaisons; adjacent landowners and other concerned entities during the formulation of Shoreline Management Plans and subsequent revisions. Notices shall be published prior to public meetings to assure maximum public awareness. Public notices shall be issued by the district commander allowing for a minimum of 30 days for receipt of written public comment in regard to the proposed Shoreline Management Plan or any major revision thereto.

(7) *Periodic Review.* Shoreline Management Plans will be reviewed periodically, but no less often than every five years, by the district commander to determine the need for update. If sufficient controversy or demand exists, consideration should be given, consistent with other factors, to a process of reevaluation of the shoreline allocations and the plan. When changes to the Shoreline Management Plan are needed, the plan will be formally updated through the public participation process. Cumulative environmental impacts of permit actions and the possibility of preparing or revising project NEPA documentation will be considered. District commanders may make minor revisions to the Shoreline Management Plan when the revisions are consistent with policy and funds for a complete plan update are not available. The amount and type of public involvement needed for such revision is at the discretion of the district commander.

(f) *Instruments for Shoreline Use.* Instruments used to authorize private shoreline use facilities, activities or development are as follows:

(1) *Shoreline Use Permits.* (i) Shoreline Use Permits are issued and enforced in accordance with provisions of 36 CFR 327.19.

(ii) Shoreline Use Permits are required for private structures/activities of any kind (except boats) in waters of Civil Works projects whether or not such waters are deemed navigable and where such waters are under the primary jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army and under the management of the Corps of Engineers.

(iii) Shoreline Use Permits are required for non-floating structures on waters deemed commercially non-navigable, when such waters are under management of the Corps of Engineers.

(iv) Shoreline Use Permits are also required for land vegetation modification activities which do not involve disruption to land form.

(v) Permits should be issued for a term of five years. To reduce administration costs, one year permits should be issued only when the location or nature of the activity requires annual reissuance.

(vi) Shoreline Use Permits for erosion control may be issued for the life or period of continual ownership of the structure by the permittee and his/her legal spouse.

(2) *Department of the Army Permits.* Dredging, construction of fixed structures, including fills and combination fixed-floating structures and the discharge of dredged or fill material in waters of the United States will be evaluated under authority of section 10, River and Harbor Act of 1899 (33 U.S.C. 403) and section 404 of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1344). Permits will be issued where appropriate.

(3) *Real Estate Instruments.* Commercial development activities and activities which involve grading, cuts, fills, or other changes in land form, or establishment of appropriate land-based support facilities required for private floating facilities, will continue to be covered by a lease, license or other legal grant issued through the appropriate real estate element. Shoreline Management Plans should identify the types of activities that require real estate instruments and indicate the general process for obtaining same. Shoreline Use Permits are not required for facilities or activities covered by a real estate instrument.

(g) *Transfer of Permits.* Shoreline Use Permits are non-transferable. They become null and void upon sale or transfer of the permitted facility or the death of the permittee and his/her legal spouse.

(h) *Existing Facilities Now Under Permit.* Implementation of a Shoreline Management Plan shall consider existing permitted facilities and prior written Corps commitments implicit in their issuance. Facilities or activities permitted under special provisions should be identified in a way that will set them apart from other facilities or activities.

(1) Section 6 of Pub. L. 97-140 provides that no lawfully installed dock or appurtenant structures shall be required to be removed prior to December 31, 1989, from any Federal water resources reservoir or lake project administered by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, on which it was located on December 29, 1981, if such property is maintained in usable condition, and does not occasion a threat to life or property.

(2) In accordance with section 1134(d) of Pub. L. 99-662, any houseboat, boathouse, floating cabin or lawfully installed dock or appurtenant structures in place under a valid shoreline use permit as of November 17, 1986, cannot be forced to be removed from any Federal water resources project or lake administered by the Secretary of the Army on or after December 31, 1989, if it meets the three conditions below except where necessary for immediate use for public purposes or higher public use or for a navigation or flood control project.

(i) Such property is maintained in a usable and safe condition,

(ii) Such property does not occasion a threat to life or property, and

(iii) The holder of the permit is in substantial compliance with the existing permit.

(3) All such floating facilities and appurtenances will be formally recognized in an appropriate Shoreline Management Plan. New permits for these permitted facilities will be issued to new owners. If the holder of the permit fails to comply with the terms of the permit, it may be revoked and the holder required to remove the structure, in accordance with the terms of the permit as to notice, time, and appeal.

(i) *Facility Maintenance.* Permitted facilities must be operated, used and maintained by the permittee in a safe, healthful condition at all times. If determined to be unsafe, the resource manager will establish together with the permittee a schedule, based on the seriousness of the safety deficiency, for correcting the deficiency or having it removed, at the permittee's expense. The applicable safety and health prescriptions in EM 385-1-1 should be used as a guide.

(j) *Density of Development.* The density of private floating and fixed recreation facilities will be established in the Shoreline Management Plan for all portions of Limited Development areas consistent with ecological and aesthetic characteristics and prior written commitments. The facility density in Limited Development Areas should, if feasible, be determined prior to the development of adjacent private property. The density of facilities will not be more than 50 per cent of the Limited Development Area in which they are located. Density will be measured by determining the linear feet of shoreline as compared to the width of the facilities in the water plus associated moorage arrangements which restrict the full unobstructed use of that portion of the shoreline. When a Limited Development Area or a portion of a Limited Development area reaches maximum density, notice should be given to the public and facility owners in that area that no additional facilities will be allowed. In all cases, sufficient open area will be maintained for safe maneuvering of watercraft. Docks should not extend out from the shore more than one-third of the width of a cove at normal recreation or multipurpose pool. In those cases where current density of development exceeds the density level established in the Shoreline Management Plan, the density will be reduced to the prescribed level through attrition.

(k) *Permit Fees.* Fees associated with the Shoreline Use Permits shall be paid prior to issuing the permit in accordance with the provisions of § 327.30(c)(1). The fee schedule will be published separately.

Appendix A to § 327.30—Guidelines for Granting Shoreline Use Permits1. General

a. Decisions regarding permits for private floating recreation facilities will consider the operating objectives and physical characteristics of each project. In developing Shoreline Management Plans, district commanders will give consideration to the effects of added private boat storage facilities on commercial concessions for that purpose. Consistent with established policies, new commercial concessions may be alternatives to additional limited development shoreline.

b. Permits for individually or group owned shoreline use facilities may be granted only in Limited Development Areas when the sites are not near commercial marine services and such use will not despoil the shoreline nor inhibit public use or enjoyment thereof. The installation and use of such facilities will not be in conflict with the preservation of the natural characteristics of the shoreline nor will they result in significant environmental damage. Charges will be made for Shoreline Use Permits in accordance with the separately published fee schedule.

c. Permits may be granted within Limited Development Areas for ski jumps, floats, boat moorage facilities, duck blinds, and other private floating recreation facilities when they will not create a safety hazard and inhibit public use or enjoyment of project waters or shoreline. A Corps permit is not required for temporary ice fishing shelters or duck blinds when they are regulated by a state program. When the facility or activity is authorized by a shoreline use permit, a separate real estate instrument is generally not required.

d. Group owned boat mooring facilities may be permitted in Limited Development Areas where practicable (e.g. where physically feasible in terms of access, water depths, wind protection, etc.).

2. Applications for Shoreline Use Permits

a. Applications for private Shoreline Use Permits will be reviewed with full consideration of the policies set forth in this and referenced regulations, and the Shoreline Management Plan. Fees associated with the Shoreline Use Permit shall be paid prior to issuing the permit. Plans and specifications of the proposed facility shall be submitted and approved prior to the start of construction. Submissions should include engineering details, structural design, anchorage method, and construction materials; the type, size, location and ownership of the facility; expected duration of use; and an indication of willingness to abide by the applicable regulations and terms and conditions of the permit. Permit applications shall also identify and locate any land-based support facilities and any specific safety considerations.

b. Permits will be issued by the district commander or his/her authorized representative on ENG Form 4264-R (Application for Shoreline Use Permit) (appendix B). Computer generated forms may be substituted for ENG Form 4264-R provided all information is included. The computer generated form will be designated, “ENG Form 4264-R-E, Oct 87 (Electronic generation approved by USACE, Oct 87)”.

c. The following are guides to issuance of Shoreline Use Permits:

(1) Use of boat mooring facilities, including piers and boat (shelters) houses, will be limited to vessel or watercraft mooring and storage of gear essential to vessel or watercraft operation.

(2) Private floating recreation facilities, including boat mooring facilities shall not be constructed or used for human habitation or in a manner which gives the appearance of converting Federal public property on which the facility is located to private, exclusive use. New docks with enclosed sides (i.e. boathouses) are prohibited.

(3) No private floating facility will exceed the minimum size required to moor the owner's boat or boats plus the minimum size required for an enclosed storage locker of oars, life preservers and other items essential to watercraft operation. Specific size limitations may be established in the project Shoreline Management Plan.

(4) All private floating recreation facilities including boat mooring facilities will be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications, approved by the resource manager, or a written certification from a licensed engineer, stating the facility is structurally safe will accompany the initial submission of the plans and specifications.

(5) Procedures regarding permits for individual facilities shall also apply to permits for non-commercial group mooring facilities.

(6) Facilities attached to the shore shall be securely anchored by means of moorings which do not obstruct the free use of the shoreline, nor damage vegetation or other natural features. Anchoring to vegetation is prohibited.

(7) Electrical service and equipment leading to or on private mooring facilities must not pose a safety hazard nor conflict with other recreational use. Electrical installations must be weatherproof and meet all current applicable electrical codes and regulations. The facility must be equipped with quick disconnect fittings mounted above the flood pool elevation. All electrical installations must conform to the National Electric Code and all state, and local codes and regulations. In those states where electricians are licensed, registered, or otherwise certified, a copy of the electrical certification must be provided to the resource manager before a Shoreline Use Permit can be issued or renewed. The resource manager will require immediate removal or disconnection of any electrical service or equipment that is not certified (if appropriate), does not meet code, or is not safely maintained. All new electrical lines will be installed underground. This will require a separate real estate instrument for the service right-of-way. Existing overhead lines will be allowed, as long as they meet all applicable electrical codes, regulations and above guidelines, to include compatibility and safety related to fluctuating water levels.

(8) Private floating recreation facilities will not be placed so as to interfere with any authorized project purposes, including navigation, or create a safety or health hazard.

(9) The district commander or his/her authorized representative may place special conditions on the permit when deemed necessary. Requests for waivers of shoreline management plan permit conditions based on health conditions will be reviewed on a case by case basis by the Operations Manager. Efforts will be made to reduce onerous requirements when a limiting health condition is obvious or when an applicant provides a doctor's certification of need for conditions which are not obvious.

(10) Vegetation modification, including but not limited to, cutting, pruning, chemical manipulation, removal or seeding by private individuals is allowed only in those areas designated as Limited Development Areas or Protected Shoreline Areas. An existing (as of July 1, 1987) vegetation modification permit, within a shoreline allocation which normally would not allow vegetation modification, should be grandfathered. Permittees will not create the appearance of private ownership of public lands.

(11) The term of a permit for vegetation modification will be for five years. Where possible, such permits will be consolidated with other shoreline management permits into a single permit. The district commander is authorized to issue vegetation modification permits of less than five years for one-time requests or to aid in the consolidation of shoreline management permits.

(12) When issued a permit for vegetative modification, the permittee will delineate the government property line, as surveyed and marked by the government, in a clear but unobtrusive manner approved by the district commander and in accordance with the project Shoreline Management Plan and the conditions of the permit. Other adjoining owners may also delineate the common boundary subject to these same conditions. This delineation may include, but is not limited to, boundary plantings and fencing. The delineation will be accomplished at no cost to the government.

(13) No permit will be issued for vegetation modification in Protected Shoreline Areas until the environmental impacts of the proposed modification are assesed by the resource manager and it has been determined that no significant adverse impacts will result. The effects of the proposed modification on water quality will also be considered in making this determination.

(14) The original of the completed permit application is to be retained by the permittee. A duplicate will be retained in the resource manager's office.

3. Permit Revocation

Permits may be revoked by the district commander when it is determined that the public interest requires such revocation or when the permittee fails to comply with terms and conditions of the permit, the Shoreline Management Plan, or of this regulation. Permits for duck blinds and ice fishing shelters will be issued to cover a period not to exceed 30 days prior to and 30 days after the season.

4. Removal of Facilities

Facilities not removed when specified in the permit or when requested after termination or revocation of the permit will be treated as unauthorized structures pursuant to 36 CFR 327.20.

5. Posting of Permit Number

Each district will procure 5″ × 8″ or larger printed permit tags of light metal or plastic for posting. The permit display tag shall be posted on the facility and/or on the land area covered by the permit, so that it can be visually checked, with ease in accordance with instructions provided by the resource manager. Facilities or activities permitted under special provisions should be identified in a way that will set apart from other facilities or activities.

Appendix B to § 327.30—Application for Shoreline Use Permit [Reserved]Appendix C to § 327.30—Shoreline Use Permit Conditions

1. This permit is granted solely to the applicant for the purpose described on the attached permit.

2. The permittee agrees to and does hereby release and agree to save and hold the Government harmless from any and all causes of action, suits at law or equity, or claims or demands or from any liability of any nature whatsoever for or on account of any damages to persons or property, including a permitted facility, growing out of the ownership, construction, operation or maintenance by the permittee of the permitted facilities and/or activities.

3. Ownership, construction, operation, use and maintenance of a permitted facility are subject to the Government's navigation servitude.

4. No attempt shall be made by the permittee to forbid the full and free use by the public of all public waters and/or lands at or adjacent to the permitted facility or to unreasonably interfere with any authorized project purposes, including navigation in connection with the ownership, construction, operation or maintenance of a permitted facility and/or activity.

5. The permittee agrees that if subsequent operations by the Government require an alteration in the location of a permitted facility and/or activity or if in the opinion of the district commander a permitted facility and/or activity shall cause unreasonable obstruction to navigation or that the public interest so requires, the permittee shall be required, upon written notice from the district commander to remove, alter, or relocate the permitted facility, without expense to the Government.

6. The Government shall in no case be liable for any damage or injury to a permitted facility which may be caused by or result from subsequent operations undertaken by the Government for the improvement of navigation or for other lawful purposes, and no claims or right to compensation shall accrue from any such damage. This includes any damage that may occur to private property if a facility is removed for noncompliance with the conditions of the permit.

7. Ownership, construction, operation, use and maintenance of a permitted facility and/or activity are subject to all applicable Federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to abide by these applicable laws and regulations may be cause for revocation of the permit.

8. This permit does not convey any property rights either in real estate or material; and does not authorize any injury to private property or invasion of private rights or any infringement of Federal, state or local laws or regulations, nor does it obviate the necessity of obtaining state or local assent required by law for the construction, operation, use or maintenance of a permitted facility and/or activity.

9. The permittee agrees to construct the facility within the time limit agreed to on the permit issuance date. The permit shall become null and void if construction is not completed within that period. Further, the permittee agrees to operate and maintain any permitted facility and/or activity in a manner so as to provide safety, minimize any adverse impact on fish and wildlife habitat, natural, environmental, or cultural resources values and in a manner so as to minimize the degradation of water quality.

10. The permittee shall remove a permitted facility within 30 days, at his/her expense, and restore the waterway and lands to a condition accepted by the resource manager upon termination or revocation of this permit or if the permittee ceases to use, operate or maintain a permitted facility and/or activity. If the permittee fails to comply to the satisfaction of the resource manager, the district commander may remove the facility by contract or otherwise and the permittee agrees to pay all costs incurred thereof.

11. The use of a permitted boat dock facility shall be limited to the mooring of the permittee's vessel or watercraft and the storage, in enclosed locker facilities, of his/her gear essential to the operation of such vessel or watercraft.

12. Neither a permitted facility nor any houseboat, cabin cruiser, or other vessel moored thereto shall be used as a place of habitation or as a full or part-time residence or in any manner which gives the appearance of converting the public property, on which the facility is located, to private use.

13. Facilities granted under this permit will not be leased, rented, sub-let or provided to others by any means of engaging in commercial activity(s) by the permittee or his/her agent for monetary gain. This does not preclude the permittee from selling total ownership to the facility.

14. Floats and the flotation material for all docks and boat mooring buoys shall be fabricated of materials manufactured for marine use. The float and its flotation material shall be 100% warranted for a minimum of 8 years against sinking, becoming waterlogged, cracking, peeling, fragmenting, or losing beads. All floats shall resist puncture and penetration and shall not be subject to damage by animals under normal conditions for the area. All floats and the flotation material used in them shall be fire resistant. Any float which is within 40 feet of a line carrying fuel shall be 100% impervious to water and fuel. The use of new or recycled plastic or metal drums or non-compartmentalized air containers for encasement or floats is prohibited. Existing floats are authorized until it or its flotation material is no longer serviceable, at which time it shall be replaced with a float that meets the conditions listed above. For any floats installed after the effective date of this specification, repair or replacement shall be required when it or its flotation material no longer performs its designated function or it fails to meet the specifications for which it was originally warranted.

15. Permitted facilities and activities are subject to periodic inspection by authorized Corps representatives. The resource manager will notify the permittee of any deficiencies and together establish a schedule for their correction. No deviation or changes from approved plans will be allowed without prior written approval of the resource manager.

16. Floating facilities shall be securely attached to the shore in accordance with the approved plans by means of moorings which do not obstruct general public use of the shoreline or adversely affect the natural terrain or vegetation. Anchoring to vegetation is prohibited.

17. The permit display tag shall be posted on the permitted facility and/or on the land areas covered by the permit so that it can be visually checked with ease in accordance with instructions provided by the resource manager.

18. No vegetation other than that prescribed in the permit will be damaged, destroyed or removed. No vegetation of any kind will be planted, other than that specifically prescribed in the permit.

19. No change in land form such as grading, excavation or filling is authorized by this permit.

20. This permit is non-transferable. Upon the sale or other transfer of the permitted facility or the death of the permittee and his/her legal spouse, this permit is null and void.

21. By 30 days written notice, mailed to the permittee by certified letter, the district commander may revoke this permit whenever the public interest necessitates such revocation or when the permittee fails to comply with any permit condition or term. The revocation notice shall specify the reasons for such action. If the permittee requests a hearing in writing to the district commander through the resource manager within the 30-day period, the district commander shall grant such hearing at the earliest opportunity. In no event shall the hearing date be more than 60 days from the date of the hearing request. Following the hearing, a written decision will be rendered and a copy mailed to the permittee by certified letter.

22. Notwithstanding the conditions cited in condition 21 above, if in the opinion of the district commander, emergency circumstances dictate otherwise, the district commander may summarily revoke the permit.

23. When vegetation modification on these lands is accomplished by chemical means, the program will be in accordance with appropriate Federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.

24. The resource manager or his/her authorized representative shall be allowed to cross the permittee's property, as necessary to inspect facilities and/or activities under permit.

25. When vegetation modification is allowed, the permittee will delineate the government property line in a clear, but unobtrusive manner approved by the resource manager and in accordance with the project Shoreline Management Plan.

26. If the ownership of a permitted facility is sold or transferred, the permittee or new owner will notify the Resource Manager of the action prior to finalization. The new owner must apply for a Shoreline Use Permit within 14 days or remove the facility and restore the use area within 30 days from the date of ownership transfer.

27. If permitted facilities are removed for storage or extensive maintenance, the resource manager may require all portions of the facility be removed from public property.
