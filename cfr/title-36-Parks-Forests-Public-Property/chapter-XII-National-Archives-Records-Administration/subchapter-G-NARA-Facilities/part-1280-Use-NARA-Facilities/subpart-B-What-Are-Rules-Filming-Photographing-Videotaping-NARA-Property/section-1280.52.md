The following conditions and restrictions apply to anyone that has been granted permission to film, photograph, or videotape for news purposes under Subpart B:

If the Public Affairs Officer approves your use of artificial lighting in the Rotunda, NARA will use facsimiles in place of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. If NARA approves your use of high intensity lighting, NARA will cover or replace with facsimiles all other exhibited documents that fall within the boundaries of such illumination. You may not use any supplemental lighting devices at the Presidential Libraries and the regional records services facilities without permission from a NARA representative at that facility.
