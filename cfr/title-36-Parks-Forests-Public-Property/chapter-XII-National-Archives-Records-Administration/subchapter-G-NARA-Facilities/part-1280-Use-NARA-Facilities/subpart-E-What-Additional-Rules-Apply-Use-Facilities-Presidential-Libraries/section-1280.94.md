##### ยง 1280.94 When do Presidential libraries allow other groups to use their public areas for events? #####

(a) Although Presidential Library buildings and grounds are intended primarily for the libraries' use in carrying out their programs, you may request the use of Presidential Library facilities when the proposed activity is:

(1) Sponsored, cosponsored, or authorized by the library;

(2) Conducted to further the library's interests; and

(3) Scheduled so as not to interfere with the normal operation of the library.

(b) Your event at the library must be for the benefit of or in connection with the mission and programs of the library and must be consistent with the public perception of the library as a research and cultural institution.

(c) To request the use of a library area, you must apply in writing to the library director (see 36 CFR 1253.3 for the address) and complete NA Form 16011, Application for Use of Space in Presidential Libraries. OMB control number 3095-0024 has been assigned to the information collection contained in this section.

(d) You may not use library facilities for any activities that involve:

(1) Profit making;

(2) Commercial advertising and sales;

(3) Partisan political activities;

(4) Sectarian activities, or other similar activities; or

(5) Any use inconsistent with those authorized in this section.

(e) You may not charge admission fees, indirect assessment, or take any other kind of monetary collection at the event. NARA will charge normal admission fees to the museum if that area is used for the event.

(f) You will be assessed additional charges by the library director to reimburse the Government for expenses incurred as a result of your use of the library facility.
