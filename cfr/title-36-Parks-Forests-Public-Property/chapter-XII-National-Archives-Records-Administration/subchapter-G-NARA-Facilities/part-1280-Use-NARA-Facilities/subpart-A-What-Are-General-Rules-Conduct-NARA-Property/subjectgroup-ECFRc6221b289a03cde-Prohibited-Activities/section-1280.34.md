##### ยง 1280.34 What are the types of corrective action NARA imposes for prohibited behavior? #####

(a) Individuals who violate the provisions of this part are subject to:

(1) Removal from the premises (removal for up to seven calendar days) and possible law enforcement notification;

(2) Banning from property owned or operated by NARA;

(3) Arrest for trespass; and

(4) Any additional types of corrective action prescribed by law.

(b) The regional administrator of the facility (or the director if so designated) has the authority to have the individual immediately removed and denied further access to the premises for up to seven calendar days. During this removal period, the Assistant Archivist for Administration renders a decision on whether the individual should be banned from specific or all NARA facilities permanently or temporarily (in up to one-year increments). Long-term banning under this part includes automatic revocation of research privileges, notwithstanding the time periods set forth in 36 CFR 1254.48 . Research privileges remain revoked until the ban is lifted, at which time an application for new privileges may be submitted.

(c) Upon written notification by the Assistant Archivist for Administration, individuals may be banned from all NARA facilities. All NARA facilities will be notified of the banning of individuals.
