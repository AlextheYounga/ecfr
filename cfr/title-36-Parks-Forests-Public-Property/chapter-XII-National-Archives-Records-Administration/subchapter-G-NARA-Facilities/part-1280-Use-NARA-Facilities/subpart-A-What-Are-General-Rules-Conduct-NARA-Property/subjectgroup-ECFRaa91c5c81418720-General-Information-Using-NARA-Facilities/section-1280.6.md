##### ยง 1280.6 Can children under the age of 14 use NARA facilities? #####

Children under the age of 14 will be admitted to NARA facilities only if they are accompanied by an adult who will supervise them at all times while on NARA property. The director of a NARA facility may authorize a lower age limit for admission of unaccompanied children to meet special circumstances (e.g., students who have been given permission to conduct research without adult supervision).
