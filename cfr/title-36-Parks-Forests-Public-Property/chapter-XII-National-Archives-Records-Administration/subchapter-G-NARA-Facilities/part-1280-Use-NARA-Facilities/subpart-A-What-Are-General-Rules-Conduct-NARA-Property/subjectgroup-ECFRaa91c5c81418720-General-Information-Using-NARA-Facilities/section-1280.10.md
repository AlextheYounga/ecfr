##### ยง 1280.10 Are there special rules for driving on NARA property? #####

(a) You must obey speed limits, posted signs, and other traffic laws, and park only in designated spaces.

(b) NARA will tow, at the owner's expense, any vehicle that is parked illegally. Except in emergencies, you may not park in spaces reserved for holders of NARA parking permits. If an emergency forces you to leave your vehicle in an illegal area, you must notify the security guards at that NARA facility as soon as possible. We will not tow your illegally parked car if you have notified a security guard of an emergency unless it is creating a hazard or blocking an entrance or an exit.

(c) We may deny any vehicle access to NARA property for public safety or security reasons.
