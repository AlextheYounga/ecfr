##### ยง 1232.14 What requirements must an agency meet before it transfers records to a records storage facility? #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 13654, March 30, 2018.

An agency must meet the following requirements before it transfers records to a records storage facility:

(a) Ensure that the requirements of 36 CFR part 1234 are met. Special attention must be paid to ensuring appropriate storage conditions for records on non-paper based media (e.g., film, audio tape, magnetic tape), especially those that are scheduled for long-term or permanent retention, as those records typically require more stringent environmental controls (see 36 CFR parts 1236 and 1237).

(b) To transfer unscheduled records, notify the National Archives and Records Administration, Modern Records Programs (NWM), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, phone number (301) 837-1738, in writing prior to the transfer. The notification must identify the records storage facility and include a copy of the information required by ยง 1232.16(a).

(c) For all records being transferred, create documentation sufficient to identify and locate files. (See ยง 1232.16.)

(d) Ensure that NARA-approved retention periods are implemented properly and that records documenting final disposition actions (destruction or transfer to the National Archives of the United States) are created and maintained.
