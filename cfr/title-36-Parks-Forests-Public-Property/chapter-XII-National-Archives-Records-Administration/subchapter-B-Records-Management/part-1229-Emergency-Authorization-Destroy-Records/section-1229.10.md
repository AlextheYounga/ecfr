When NARA and the agency that has custody of them jointly determine that records in the custody of an agency of the U.S. Government are a continuing menace to human health or life, or to property, NARA will authorize the agency to eliminate the menace immediately by any method necessary:

(a) When an agency identifies records that pose a continuing menace to human health or life, or to property, the records officer or other designee must immediately notify the National Archives and Records Administration, Modern Records Programs (NWM), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, phone number (301) 837-1738. The notice must specify the description of the records, their location and quantity, and the nature of the menace.

(b) If NARA concurs in a determination that the records must be destroyed, NARA will notify the agency to immediately destroy the records.

(c) If NARA does not concur that the menace must be eliminated by destruction of the records, NARA will advise the agency on remedial action to address the menace.
