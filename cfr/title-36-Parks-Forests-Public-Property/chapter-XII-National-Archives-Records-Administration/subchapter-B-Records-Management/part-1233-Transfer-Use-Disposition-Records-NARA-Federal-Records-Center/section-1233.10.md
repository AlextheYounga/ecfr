(b) Agencies must use their designated NARA Federal Records Center(s) as specified in their agency agreement with NARA (Federal Records Center Program (FRCP)) for the storage of records.

(c) Transfers to NARA Federal Records Centers must be preceded by the submission of a Standard Form (SF) 135, Records Transmittal and Receipt, or an electronic equivalent.
