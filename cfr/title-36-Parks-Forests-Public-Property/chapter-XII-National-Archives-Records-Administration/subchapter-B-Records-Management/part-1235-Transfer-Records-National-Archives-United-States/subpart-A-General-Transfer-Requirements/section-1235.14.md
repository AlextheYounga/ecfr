##### ยง 1235.14 May agencies retain records for the conduct of regular agency business after they are eligible for transfer? #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 13656, March 30, 2018.

(a) Agencies may retain records longer than specified on a records disposition schedule only with written approval from NARA.

(b) If the agency determines that the records are needed for the conduct of regular business, the records officer must submit to the National Archives and Records Administration, Modern Records Programs (NWM), 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, phone number (301) 837-1738, a written request certifying continuing need. This certification must:

(1) Include a comprehensive description and location of records to be retained;

(2) Cite the NARA-approved disposition authority;

(3) Describe the current business for which the records are required;

(4) Estimate the length of time the records will be needed (if no date is provided by the agency, approved certification requests will be effective for a maximum of five years);

(5) Explain why agency needs cannot be met by NARA reference services or copies of records deposited in the National Archives of the United States; and

(6) If records are retained to enable routine public reference by the agency rather than NARA, cite the statutory authority authorizing this agency activity.
