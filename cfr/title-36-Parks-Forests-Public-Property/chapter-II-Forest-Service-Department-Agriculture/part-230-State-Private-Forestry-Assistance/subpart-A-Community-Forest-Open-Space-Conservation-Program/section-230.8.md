##### ยง 230.8 Acquisition requirements. #####

(a) Grant recipients participating in the CFP must complete the following, which applies to all tracts, including cost share tracts:

(1) Complete an appraisal:

(i) For lands purchased with CFP funds, the appraisal must comply with Federal Appraisal Standards prior to the release of the grant funds. The grant recipient must provide documentation that the appraisal and associated appraisal review were conducted in a manner consistent with the Federal appraisal standards.

(ii) For donated cost share tracts, the market value must be determined by an independent appraiser. The value needs to be documented by a responsible official of the party to which the property is donated.

(2) Prior to closing, notify the landowner in writing of the appraised value of the property and that the sale is voluntary. If the grant recipient has a voluntary option for less than appraised value, they do not have to renegotiate the agreement.

(3) Purchase all surface and subsurface mineral rights, whenever possible. However, if severed mineral rights cannot be obtained, then the grant recipient must follow the retention of qualified mineral interest requirements outlined in the Internal Revenue Service regulations (26 CFR 1.170A-14 (g)(4)), which address both surface and subsurface minerals.

(4) Ensure that title to lands acquired conforms to title standards applicable to State land acquisitions where the land is located:

(i) Title to lands acquired using CFP funds must not be subject to encumbrances or agreements of any kind that would be contrary to the purpose of the CFP.

(ii) Title insurance must not be a substitute for acceptable title.

(5) Record with the deed in the lands record of the local county or municipality, a Notice of Grant Requirement, which includes the following:

(i) States that the property (including cost share tracts) was purchased with CFP funds;

(ii) Provides a legal description;

(iii) Identifies the name and address of the grant recipient who is the authorized title holder;

(iv) States the purpose of the CFP;

(v) References the Grant Agreement with the Forest Service (title and agreement number) and the address where it is kept on file;

(vi) States that the grant recipient confirms its obligation to manage the interest in real property pursuant to the grant, the Community Forest Plan, and the purpose of the CFP;

(vii) States that the grant recipient will not convey or encumber the interest in real property, in whole or in part, to another party; and

(viii) States that the grant recipient will manage the interest in real property consistent with the purpose of the CFP.
