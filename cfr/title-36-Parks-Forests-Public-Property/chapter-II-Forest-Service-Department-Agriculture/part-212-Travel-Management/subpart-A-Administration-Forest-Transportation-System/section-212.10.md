##### § 212.10 Maximum economy National Forest System roads. #####

The Chief may acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, and maintain National Forest System roads within and near the National Forests and other lands administered by the Forest Service in locations and according to specifications which will permit maximum economy in harvesting timber from such lands tributary to such roads and at the same time meet the requirements for protection, development, and management thereof and for utilization of the other resources thereof. Financing of such roads may be accomplished—

(a) By the Chief utilizing appropriated funds,

(b) By requirements on purchasers of National Forest timber and other products, including provisions for amortization of road costs in contracts,

(c) By cooperative financing with other public agencies and with private agencies or persons, or

(d) By a combination of these methods, provided that where roads are to be constructed at a higher standard than the standard—consistent with applicable environmental laws and regulations—that is sufficient for harvesting and removal of National Forest timber and other products covered by a particular sale, the purchaser of the timber and other products shall not be required to bear the part of the cost necessary to meet the higher standard, and the Chief may make such arrangements to achieve this end as may be appropriate.
