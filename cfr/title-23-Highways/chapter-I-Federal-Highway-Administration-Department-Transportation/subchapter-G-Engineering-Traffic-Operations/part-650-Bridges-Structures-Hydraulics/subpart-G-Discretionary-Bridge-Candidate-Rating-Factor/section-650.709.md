##### ยง 650.709 Special considerations. #####

(a) The selection process for new discretionary bridge projects will be based upon the rating factor priority ranking. However, although not specifically included in the rating factor formula, special consideration will be given to bridges that are closed to all traffic or that have a load restriction of less than 10 tons. Consideration will also be given to bridges with other unique situations, and to bridge candidates in States that have not previously been allocated discretionary bridge funds. In addition, consideration will be given to candidates that receive additional funds or contributions from local, State, county, or private sources, but not from Federal sources which reduce the total Federal cost or Federal share of the project. These funds or contributions may be used to reduce the total project cost for use in the rating factor formula.

(b) The need to administer the program from a balanced national perspective requires that the special cases set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and other unique situations be considered in the discretionary bridge candidate evaluation process.

(c) Priority consideration will be given to the continuation and completion of projects previously begun with discretionary bridge funds which will be ready to begin construction in the fiscal year in which funds are available for obligation.
