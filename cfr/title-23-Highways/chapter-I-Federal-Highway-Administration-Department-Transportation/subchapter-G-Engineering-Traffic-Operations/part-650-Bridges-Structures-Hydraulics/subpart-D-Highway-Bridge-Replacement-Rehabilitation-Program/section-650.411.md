##### ยง 650.411 Procedures for bridge replacement and rehabilitation projects. #####

(a) Consideration shall be given to projects which will remove from service highway bridges most in danger of failure.

(b) *Submission and approval of projects.* (1) Bridge replacement or rehabilitation projects shall be submitted by the State to the Secretary in accordance with 23 CFR part 630, subpart A Federal-Aid Programs, Approval and Authorization.

(2) Funds apportioned to a State shall be made available throughout each State on a fair and equitable basis.

(c)(1) Each approved project will be designed, constructed, and inspected for acceptance in the same manner as other projects on the system on which the project is located. It shall be the responsibility of the State agency to properly maintain, or cause to be properly maintained, any project constructed under this bridge program. The State highway agency shall enter into a formal agreement for maintenance with appropriate local government officials in cases where an eligible project is located within and is under the legal authority of such a local government.

(2) Whenever a deficient bridge is replaced or its deficiency alleviated by a new bridge under the bridge program, the deficient bridge shall either be dismantled or demolished or its use limited to the type and volume of traffic the structure can safely service over its remaining life. For example, if the only deficiency of the existing structure is inadequate roadway width and the combination of the new and existing structure can be made to meet current standards for the volume of traffic the facility will carry over its design life, the existing bridge may remain in place and be incorporated into the system.
