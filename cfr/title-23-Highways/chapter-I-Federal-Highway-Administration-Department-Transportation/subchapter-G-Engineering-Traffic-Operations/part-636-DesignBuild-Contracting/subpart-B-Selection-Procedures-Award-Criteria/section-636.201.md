##### ยง 636.201 What selection procedures and award criteria may be used? #####

You should consider using two-phase selection procedures for all design-build projects. However, if you do not believe two-phase selection procedures are appropriate for your project (based on the criteria in ยง 636.202), you may use a single phase selection procedure or the modified-design-build contracting method. The following procedures are available:

|                  Selection procedure                   |  Criteria for using a selection procedure   |                                                             Award criteria options                                                              |
