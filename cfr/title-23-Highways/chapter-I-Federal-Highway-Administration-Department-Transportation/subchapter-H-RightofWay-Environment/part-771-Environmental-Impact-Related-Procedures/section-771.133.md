The final EIS or FONSI should document compliance with requirements of all applicable environmental laws, Executive orders, and other related requirements.

Approval of the environmental document constitutes adoption of any Administration findings and determinations that are contained therein. The Administration's approval of an environmental document constitutes its finding of compliance with the report requirements of 23 U.S.C. 128.
