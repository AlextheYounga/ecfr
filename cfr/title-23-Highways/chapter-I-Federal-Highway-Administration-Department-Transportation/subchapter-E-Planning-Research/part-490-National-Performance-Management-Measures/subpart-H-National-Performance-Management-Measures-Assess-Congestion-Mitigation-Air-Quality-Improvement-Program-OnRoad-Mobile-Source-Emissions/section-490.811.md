##### § 490.811 Calculation of Total Emissions Reduction measure. #####

(a) The Total Emission Reductions performance measure specified in § 490.807 shall be calculated in accordance with this section by State DOTs and MPOs to carry out CMAQ on-road mobile source emissions performance-related requirements of this part.

(b) The Total Emission Reductions measure for each of the criteria pollutant or applicable precursor for all projects reported to the CMAQ Public Access System shall be calculated to the nearest one thousandths, as follows:
