(C) *Relationship with other performance expectations.* A discussion, to the maximum extent practicable, on how the established targets in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(A) of this section support expectations documented in longer range plans, such as the State asset management plan required by 23 U.S.C. 119(e) and the long-range statewide transportation plan provided in part 450 of this chapter;

(D) *Urbanized area boundaries and population data for targets.* For the purpose of establishing additional targets for urbanized and non-urbanized areas in § 490.105(e)(3) and the urbanized area specific targets in § 490.105(e)(8), State DOTs shall document the boundary extent for all applicable urbanized areas based on information in HPMS;

(E) *Congestion at truck freight bottlenecks.* The State DOT shall document the location of truck freight bottlenecks within the State, including those identified in the National Freight Strategic Plan. If a State has prepared a State Freight Plan under 49 U.S.C. 70202, within the last 2 years, then the State Freight Plan may serve as the basis for identifying truck freight bottlenecks;

(F) *Nonattainment and maintenance area for targets.* Where applicable, for the purpose of determining target scope in § 490.105(d) and any additional targets under § 490.105(e)(9)(iv), State DOTs shall describe the boundaries of U.S. EPA's designated nonattainment and maintenance areas, as described in §§ 490.103(c) and 490.105(e)(9)(v);

(H) *Applicable target achievement discussion.* If FHWA determined that a State DOT has not made significant progress toward the achievement of any 4-year NHPP or NHFP targets in the FHWA determination made after the State DOT submits the Full Performance Period Progress Report for the immediate prior performance period, then the State DOT shall include a description of the actions they will undertake to better achieve those targets as required under § 490.109(f). If FHWA determined under § 490.109(e) that the State DOT has made significant progress for immediate prior performance period's 4-year NHPP or NHFP targets, then the State DOT does not need to include this description for those targets;

(I) *MPO CMAQ Performance Plan.* Where applicable, State DOTs shall include as an attachment the MPO CMAQ Performance Plan, described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and

(J) *GHG metrics for the GHG measure.* Total tailpipe CO2 emissions for 2 preceding calendars years of the year in which the Mid Performance Period Progress Report is due to FHWA, as described in § 490.511(f)(2), for the GHG measure in § 490.507(b).
