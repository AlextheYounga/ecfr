(b) If the State believes it meets the requirements of 23 U.S.C. 159 and this regulation on the basis that it has enacted and is enforcing a law that suspends or revokes the driver's license of drug offenders, the certification shall contain:

(1) A statement by the Governor of the State that the State has enacted and is enforcing a Drug Offender's Driver's License Suspension law that conforms to 23 U.S.C. 159(a)(3)(A). The certifying statement may be worded as follows: I, (Name of Governor), Governor of the (State or Commonwealth) of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, do hereby certify that the (State or Commonwealth) of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, has enacted is enforcing a Drug Offender's Driver's License Suspension law that conforms to section 23 U.S. C. 159(a)(3)(A).
