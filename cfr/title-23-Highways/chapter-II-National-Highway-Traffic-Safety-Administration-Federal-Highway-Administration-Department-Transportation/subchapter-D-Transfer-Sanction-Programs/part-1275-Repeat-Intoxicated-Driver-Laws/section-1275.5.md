##### § 1275.5 “General practice” certification option. #####

(a) Notwithstanding § 1275.4(a)(3), a State that otherwise meets the requirements of § 1275.4 may comply with 23 U.S.C. 164 and this part based on the State's “general practice” for incarceration. A State electing this option shall—

(1) If the State law does not comply with the requirements of § 1275.4(a)(3)(i), submit the following certification signed by the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety:

I, [Name], Governor's Representative for Highway Safety, certify that, in [State name], at least 75 percent of *repeat intoxicated drivers* receive a *mandatory sentence* of *imprisonment* for a second offense, as those terms are defined in 23 CFR 1275.3. This certification is based on data from the period of twelve consecutive months of the calendar year immediately preceding the date of this certification. I sign this certification based on personal knowledge and other appropriate inquiry. [Signature of Governor's Representative for Highway Safety] [Date of signature]

(2) If the State law does not comply with the requirements of § 1275.4(a)(3)(ii), submit the following certification signed by the Governor's Representative for Highway Safety:

I, [Name], Governor's Representative for Highway Safety, certify that, in [State name], at least 75 percent of *repeat intoxicated drivers* receive a *mandatory sentence* of not less than ten days (240 hours) of *imprisonment* for a third or subsequent offense, as those terms are defined in 23 CFR 1275.3. This certification is based on data from the period of twelve consecutive months of the calendar year immediately preceding the date of this certification. I sign this certification based on personal knowledge and other appropriate inquiry. [Signature of Governor's Representative for Highway Safety] [Date of signature]

(b) A State electing the option under this section must submit a new certification to the appropriate NHTSA Regional Administrator by not later than October 1 of each fiscal year to avoid the reservation of funds specified in § 1275.6. The State is encouraged to submit the certification by August 15 to avoid any delay in release of funds on October 1 of that calendar year while NHTSA evaluates its certification.
