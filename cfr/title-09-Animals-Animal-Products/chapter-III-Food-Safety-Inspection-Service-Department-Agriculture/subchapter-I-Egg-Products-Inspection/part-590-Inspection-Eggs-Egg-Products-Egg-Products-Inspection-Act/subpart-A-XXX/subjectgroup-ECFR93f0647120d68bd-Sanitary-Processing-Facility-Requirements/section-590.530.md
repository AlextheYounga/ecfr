<sup>1</sup> Stabilized liquid whites shall be dried as soon as possible after removal of glucose. The storage of stabilized liquid whites shall be limited to that necessary to provide a continuous operation.

<sup>2</sup> The cooling process shall be continued to assure that any salt product to be held in excess of 24 hours is cooled and maintained at 45 °F. or lower.

(d) Upon written request and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the National Supervisor, liquid cooling and holding temperatures not otherwise provided for in this section may be approved.

(e) Agitators shall be operated in such a manner as will minimize foaming.

(f) When ice is used as an emergency refrigerant by being placed directly into the egg meat, the source of the ice must be certified by the local or State board of health. Such liquid shall be dried. All ice shall be handled in a sanitary manner.

(g) Previously frozen egg or egg product cannot be added to liquid product for the purpose of complying with liquid cooling requirements.
