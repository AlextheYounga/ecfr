<sup>1</sup> Stabilized liquid whites shall be dried as soon as possible after removal of glucose. The storage of stabilized liquid whites shall be limited to that necessary to provide a continuous operation.

<sup>2</sup> The cooling process shall be continued to assure that any salt product to be held in excess of 24 hours is cooled and maintained at 45 °F or lower.

(d) Upon written request and under such conditions as may be prescribed by the National Supervisor, liquid cooling and holding temperatures not otherwise provided for in this section may be approved.
