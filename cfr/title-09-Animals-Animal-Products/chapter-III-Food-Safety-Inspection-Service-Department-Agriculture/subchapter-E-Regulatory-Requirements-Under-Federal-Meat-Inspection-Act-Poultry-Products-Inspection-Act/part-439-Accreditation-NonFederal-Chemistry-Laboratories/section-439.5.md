(b) At the time that an Application for Accreditation is filed with the ALP, the management of a laboratory shall, for each accreditation sought, submit a check, bank draft, or money order in the amount specified in 9 CFR 391.5, made payable to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, along with the completed application for the accreditation(s). When so provided for by FSIS, electronic transfer of funds may be accepted.

(d) Annually on the anniversary date of each accreditation, FSIS will issue a bill in the amount specified in 9 CFR 391.5 for each accreditation held. Bills are payable upon receipt by check, bank draft, or money order made payable to the U.S. Department of Agriculture and become delinquent 30 days from the date of the bill.

(e) Accreditation will be terminated without further procedure for having a delinquent account. The fee(s) paid will be nonrefundable and will be credited to the account from which the expenses of the ALP are paid.
