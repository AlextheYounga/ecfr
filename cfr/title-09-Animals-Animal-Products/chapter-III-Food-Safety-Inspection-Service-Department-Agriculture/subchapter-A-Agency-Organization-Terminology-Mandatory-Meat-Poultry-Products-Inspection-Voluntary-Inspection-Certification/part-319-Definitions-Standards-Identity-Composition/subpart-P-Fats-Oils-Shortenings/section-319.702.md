##### § 319.702 Lard, leaf lard. #####

(a) Lard is the fat rendered from clean and sound edible tissues from swine. The tissues may be fresh, frozen, cooked, or prepared by other processes approved by the Administrator in specific cases, upon his determination that the use of such processes will not result in the adulteration or misbranding of the lard. The tissues shall be reasonably free from blood, and shall not include stomachs, livers, spleens, kidneys, and brains, or settlings and skimmings. “Leaf Lard” is lard prepared from fresh leaf (abdominal) fat.

(b) Lard (when properly labeled) may be hardened by the use of lard stearin or hydrogenated lard or both and may contain refined lard and deodorized lard, but the labels of such lard shall state such facts, as applicable.

(c) Products labeled “Lard” or “Leaf Lard” must have the following identity and quality characteristics to insure good color, odor, and taste of finished product:

|           (1) Color            |  White when solid, Maximum 3.0 red units in a 51/4 inch cell on the Lovibond scale.   |
