(b) Cured pork products for which there is a qualifying statement required in paragraph (a) of this section shall bear that statement as part of the product name in lettering not less than3/8 inch in height, or in lettering not less than one-third the size of the largest letter in the product name if it is in the same color and style of print and on the same color background as the product name. However, the Administrator may approve smaller lettering for labeling of packages of 1 pound or less, provided such lettering is at least one-third the size and of the same color and style as the product name.

(c) Cured pork product prepared pursuant to this section shall be subject to the compliance procedures in § 318.19 of this subchapter.

(d) The binders provided for use in cured pork products in a regulation in this subchapter, in 9 CFR chapter III, subchapter E, or in 21 CFR chapter I, subchapter A or subchapter B, may be used singly in those cured pork products labeled as “Ham Water Added,” “Ham and Water Product-X% of Weight is Added Ingredients,” and “Ham with Natural Juices.” In addition to the binders referred to in the preceding sentence, the following substances are permitted for use as binders and may be used singly in those cured pork products labeled as “Ham Water Added,” “Ham and Water Product-X% of Weight is Added Ingredients,” and “Ham with Natural Juices”: pork collagen at up to 3.5% of the product formulation. Unless their use is provided for in a regulation in this subchapter, in 9 CFR chapter III, subchapter E, or in 21 CFR chapter I, subchapter A or subchapter B, or in this paragraph, these binders are not permitted to be used in combination with another such binder listed for use in cured pork products. When any such substance is added to these products, the substance shall be declared in the ingredients statement by its common or usual name in order of predominance.
