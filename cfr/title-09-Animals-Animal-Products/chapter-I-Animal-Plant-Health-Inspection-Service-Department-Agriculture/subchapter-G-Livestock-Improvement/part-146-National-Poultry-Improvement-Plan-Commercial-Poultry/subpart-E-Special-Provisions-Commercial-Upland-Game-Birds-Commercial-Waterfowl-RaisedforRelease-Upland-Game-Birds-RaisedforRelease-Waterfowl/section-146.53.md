Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 62571, Oct. 5, 2020.

Participating flocks which have met the respective requirements specified in this section may be designated by the following terms and the corresponding designs illustrated in § 146.9 of this part:

(a) *U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored.* This program is intended to be the basis from which the commercial waterfowl and commercial upland game bird industry may conduct a program to monitor for the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza. It is intended to determine the presence of the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza in commercial waterfowl and commercial upland game birds through routine surveillance of each participating slaughter plant or, in the case of egg-producing flocks, the regular surveillance of these flocks. A slaughter plant will qualify for this classification when the Official State Agency determines that it has met one of the following requirements:

(1) It is a commercial upland game bird slaughter plant or commercial waterfowl slaughter plant where a minimum of 11 birds per shift are tested negative for the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza, as provided in § 146.13(b), at slaughter;

(2) It is a commercial upland game bird slaughter plant or commercial waterfowl slaughter plant that only accepts commercial upland game birds or commercial waterfowl from flocks where a minimum of 11 birds per flock have been tested negative for the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza, as provided in § 146.13(b), no more than 21 days prior to slaughter; or

(3) It is a commercial upland game bird slaughter plant or commercial waterfowl slaughter plant that has an ongoing active and passive surveillance program for H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza that is approved by the Official State Agency and the Service.

(4) It is a commercial upland game bird or waterfowl flock that produces eggs for human consumption where a minimum of 11 birds per flock have been tested negative to the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza as provided in § 146.13(b) within 30 days of disposal or within a 12 month period.

(5) It is a commercial upland game bird or waterfowl flock that has an on-going active and passive surveillance program for H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza that is approved by the Official State Agency and the Service.

(b) *U.S. H5/H7 Avian Influenza Monitored.* This program is intended to be the basis from which the raised-for-release upland game bird and raised-for-release waterfowl industries may conduct a program to monitor for the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza. It is intended to determine the presence of the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza through routine surveillance of each participating premises. A premises will qualify for the classification when the Official State Agency determines that a representative sample of 30 birds from the participating premises has been tested with negative results for the H5/H7 subtypes of avian influenza, as provided in § 146.13(b), every 90 days.
