##### § 73.12 Ivermectin.1 #####

1 Tissue residues remain following treatment with ivermectin. Cattle treated with ivermectin are not allowed to be slaughtered for food purposes until the expiration of such period as may be required under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 *et seq.*). Further, the animal drug regulations in 21 CFR parts 522 and 556 promulgated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 *et seq.*) contain limitations on the use of ivermectin and contain tolerances for ivermectin in edible cattle tissue. With respect to the limitations 21 CFR part 522 provides the following: “For subcutaneous use only. Not for intramuscular use. Do not treat cattle within 35 days of slaughter. Because a withdrawal time in milk has not been established, do not use in female dairy cattle of breeding age. Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.”

(a) Cattle affected with scabies or which just prior to movement were affected with or exposed to scabies may be moved interstate from a nonquarantined area after being treated with ivermectin under the supervision of an APHIS inspector or State inspector in accordance with the directions on the label of the drug if the following conditions are met:

(1) Such cattle are kept physically separated for 14 days following treatment from all cattle not part of the group treated together with ivermectin (regardless of whether the cattle are moved interstate before the end of the 14-day period); and

(2) If such cattle are moved interstate before the end of the 14th day following treatment, at the time of interstate movement they are accompanied by a certificate issued and signed by an APHIS inspector or State inspector identifying the group of cattle treated with ivermectin and stating the date on which the cattle were treated with ivermectin; and

(3) If such cattle are moved interstate before the end of the 14th day following treatment, at the time of interstate movement the means of conveyance carrying them is placarded and the billing marked in accordance with § 73.6.

Note:

Cattle from nonquarantined areas which are not affected with scabies or which just prior to movement were not affected with or exposed to scabies may be moved interstate without restrictions under this part. Accordingly, cattle from nonquarantined areas which had been treated with ivermectin more than 14 days before movement interstate may be moved interstate without restriction under this part unless following treatment they become affected with scabies or just prior to movement become affected with or exposed to scabies.

(b) Cattle may be moved interstate from a quarantined area after being treated with ivermectin under the supervision of an APHIS inspector or State inspector in accordance with the directions on the label of the drug if the following conditions are met:

(1) Such cattle are moved interstate within 21 days following treatment with ivermectin; and

(2) Such cattle are kept physically separated for 14 days following treatment from all cattle not part of the group treated together with ivermectin (regardless of whether the cattle are moved interstate before the end of the 14 day period); and, if such cattle are moved within the 15- to 21-day period following treatment, they remain kept physically separated from all cattle not a part of the group treated together with ivermectin until after they are moved interstate; and

(3) Such cattle are accompanied at the time of interstate movement by a certificate issued and signed by an APHIS inspector or State inspector identifying the group of cattle treated with ivermectin and stating the date on which the cattle were treated with ivermectin; and

(4) If such cattle are moved interstate before the end of the 14 day period following treatment, at the time of interstate movement the means of conveyance carrying them is placarded and the billing marked in accordance with § 73.6.
