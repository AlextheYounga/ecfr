|<sup>1</sup> The requirements set forth the sustaining rations for a full load of livestock in a railroad car 40 feet in length. The requirements for a full load of livestock in railroad cars of different sizes should be modified proportionately, i.e., a load of livestock transported in a car 50 feet in length would require an additional 25 percent of feed or 2.5 percent for each additional foot of car over 40 feet.|                              |                                         |

Dairy calves too young to eat hay or grain, or shipped without their dams, should be given a sufficient amount of prepared calf feed, milk, raw eggs, or other suitable feed. All feed should be of good quality.                                                                              |                              |                                         |

(b) When the owner of a consignment of livestock desires that they be fed larger amounts of feed than those designated in paragraph (a) of this section for the particular kind and quantity of livestock, or the carrier believes that they should be fed larger amounts, the amounts to be fed should be agreed upon, if practicable, by the owner and the carrier at the time the animals are offered for shipment.

(c) When emergency conditions arise, such as severe changes in the weather, which increase the rigors of transportation, the livestock should receive amounts of feed, additional to those designated in paragraph (a) of this section, sufficient to sustain them until they arrive at the next feeding station or destination.

(d) When the movement of livestock is delayed en route so that the period of their confinement in the cars materially exceeds that specified by the Twenty-Eight Hour Law, the livestock should receive additional feed in proportion to such excess time.
