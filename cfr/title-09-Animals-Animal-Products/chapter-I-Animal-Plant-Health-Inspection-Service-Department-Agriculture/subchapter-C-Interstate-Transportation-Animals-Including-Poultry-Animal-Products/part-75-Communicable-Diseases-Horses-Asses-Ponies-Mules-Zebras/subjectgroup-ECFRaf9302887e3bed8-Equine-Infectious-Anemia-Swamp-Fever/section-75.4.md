(b) *Interstate movement.* No reactor may be moved interstate unless the reactor is officially identified, is accompanied by a certificate, and meets the conditions of either paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section: *Provided,* That official identification is not necessary if the reactor is moved directly to slaughter under a permit and in a conveyance sealed with an official seal:

(1) The reactor is moved interstate for immediate slaughter, either to a Federally inspected slaughtering establishment operating under the provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 *et seq.*) or to a State-inspected slaughtering establishment that has inspection by a State representative at time of slaughter; or

(2) The reactor is moved interstate to a diagnostic or research facility after the individual issuing the certificate has consulted with the State animal health official in the State of destination and has determined that the reactor to be moved interstate will be maintained in isolation sufficient to prevent the transmission of equine infectious anemia to other horses, asses, ponies, mules, or zebras, and will remain quarantined under State authority at the diagnostic or research facility until natural death, slaughter, or until disposed of by euthanasia; or

(3) The reactor is moved interstate to its home farm after the individual issuing the certificate has consulted with the State animal health official in the State of destination and has determined that the reactor to be moved interstate will be maintained in isolation sufficient to prevent the transmission of equine infectious anemia to other horses, asses, ponies, mules, or zebras, and will remain quarantined under State authority on the reactor's home farm until natural death, slaughter, or until disposed of by euthanasia; and

(4) The reactor is moved interstate through no more than one approved stockyard for sale for immediate slaughter, and is moved within five days of its arrival at the approved stockyard directly to:

(i) Slaughter at a federally inspected slaughtering establishment operating under the provisions of the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 *et seq.*), or,
