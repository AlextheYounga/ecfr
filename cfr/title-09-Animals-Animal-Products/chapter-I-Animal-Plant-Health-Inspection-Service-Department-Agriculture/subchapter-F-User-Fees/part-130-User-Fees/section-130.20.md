(2) If an export certificate covers more than one animal, but the number of tests required for different animals are not the same, the user fee for the certificate is the fee which would be due if all the animals on the certificate required the same number of tests as the animal which requires the greatest number of tests.

(c) The user fees prescribed in this section will not apply to an export health certificate if the export health certificate is prepared for endorsement completely at the site of the inspection by an APHIS veterinarian in the course of performing inspection or supervision services for the animals listed on the certificate, and an APHIS user fee is payable under § 130.30 of this part for the inspection or supervision services performed by the veterinarian.

(d) If a service must be conducted on a Sunday or holiday or at any other time outside the normal tour of duty of the employee, then reimbursable overtime, as provided for in part 97 of this chapter, must be paid for each service, in addition to the user fee listed in this section.
