*Administrator.* The Administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or any other employee of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service delegated to act in the Administrator's stead.

*Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).* The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

*Breeding flock.* A flock that is composed of stock that has been developed for commercial egg or meat production and is maintained for the principal purpose of producing progeny for the ultimate production of eggs or meat for human consumption.

*Classification.* A designation earned by participation in a Plan program.

*Commercial flock or slaughter plant.* A commercial poultry flock or slaughter plant that is required because of its size to participate in the special provisions in part 146 of this chapter in order to participate in the Plan.

*Cooperating State Agency.* Any State authority recognized by the Department to cooperate in the administration of the provisions of this part 56. This may include the State animal health authority or the Official State Agency.

*Department.* The U.S. Department of Agriculture.

*Domesticated.* Propagated and maintained under the control of a person.

*Flock plan.* A written flock management agreement developed by APHIS and the Official State Agency with input from the flock owner and other affected parties. A flock plan sets out the steps to be taken to eradicate H5/H7 LPAI from a positive flock, or to prevent introduction of H5/H7 LPAI into another flock. A flock plan shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, poultry and poultry product movement and geographically appropriate infected and control/monitoring zones. Control measures in the flock plan should include detailed plans for safe handling of conveyances, containers, and other associated materials that could serve as fomites; disposal of flocks; cleaning and disinfection; downtime; and repopulation.

*H5/H7 low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI).* An infection of poultry caused by an influenza A virus of H5 or H7 subtype that has an intravenous pathogenicity index in 6-week-old chickens less than or equal to 1.2 or causes less than 75 percent mortality in 4- to 8-week-old chickens infected intravenously, or an infection with influenza A viruses of H5 or H7 subtype with a cleavage site that is not consistent with a previously identified highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.

*H5/H7 LPAI exposed.* At risk of developing H5/H7 LPAI because of association with birds or poultry infected with H5/H7 LPAI, excrement from birds or poultry infected with H5/H7 LPAI, or other material touched by birds or poultry infected with H5/H7 LPAI, or because there is reason to believe that association has occurred with H5/H7 LPAI or vectors of H5/H7 LPAI, as determined by the Cooperating State Agency and confirmed by APHIS.

*H5/H7 LPAI virus infection (infected).* (1) Poultry will be considered to be infected with H5/H7 LPAI for the purposes of this part if:

(i) H5/H7 LPAI virus has been isolated and identified as such from poultry; or

(ii) Viral antigen or viral RNA specific to the H5 or H7 subtype of AI virus has been detected in poultry; or

(iii) Antibodies to the H5 or H7 subtype of the AI virus that are not a consequence of vaccination have been detected in poultry. If vaccine is used, methods should be used to distinguish vaccinated birds from birds that are both vaccinated and infected. In the case of isolated serological positive results, H5/H7 LPAI infection may be ruled out on the basis of a thorough epidemiological investigation that does not demonstrate further evidence of H5/H7 LPAI infection, as determined by the Cooperating State Agency, the Official State Agency, and APHIS.

(2) The official determination that H5/H7 LPAI virus has been isolated and identified, viral antigen or viral RNA specific to the H5 or H7 subtype of AI virus has been detected, or antibodies to the H5 or H7 subtype of AI virus have been detected may only be made by the National Veterinary Services Laboratories.

*Mortgage.* Any mortgage, lien, or other security or beneficial interest held by any person other than the one claiming indemnity for the destruction of poultry or eggs due to H5/H7 LPAI.

*Official appraiser (APHIS official appraiser, State official appraiser).* A person authorized by APHIS to appraise poultry for the purposes of this part. A State official appraiser is selected by a State and authorized by APHIS.

*Official State Agency.* The State authority recognized by the Department to cooperate in the administration of the Plan.

*Plan.* The provisions of the National Poultry Improvement Plan contained in parts 145, 146, and 147 of this chapter.

*Table-egg layer.* A domesticated chicken grown for the primary purpose of producing eggs for human consumption.

*United States.* All of the States.
