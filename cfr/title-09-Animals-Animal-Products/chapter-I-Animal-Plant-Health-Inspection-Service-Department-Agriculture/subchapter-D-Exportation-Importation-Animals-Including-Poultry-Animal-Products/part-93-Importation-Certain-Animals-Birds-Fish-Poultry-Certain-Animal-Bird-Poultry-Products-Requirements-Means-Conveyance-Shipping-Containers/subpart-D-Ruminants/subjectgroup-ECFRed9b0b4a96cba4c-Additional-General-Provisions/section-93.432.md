Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 57953, Sept. 17, 2020.

(a) All cattle to be imported from the Republic of Ireland shall be accompanied by a certificate issued or endorsed by a salaried veterinarian of the Republic of Ireland showing that the cattle originated from a herd which is officially certified by the Republic of Ireland as a brucellosis qualified for export herd and that the cattle meet the requirements in ยง 93.432(c).

(b) A brucellosis qualified for export herd is a herd in which all of the cattle have been maintained as a herd unit for at least two years prior to importation and all of the test eligible cattle in the herd (*i.e.*, cattle over 6 months of age, except steers and spayed heifers) have been tested annually for brucellosis and found negative in accordance with Republic of Ireland requirements for at least two years prior to importation. The most recent negative herd test must have been conducted within 12 months of the date of importation. In addition:

(1) Such herd unit may include cattle which were born and raised within such herd unit during the two year period, or cattle which were moved directly to the herd from another herd unit of like status; or

(2) Such herd unit may include other cattle (except brucellosis reactors, suspects and animals listed in ยง 93.432(c)(1)) if:

(i) Such other cattle have been tested for brucellosis and found negative within 30 days prior to entry into the herd unit and all eligible cattle in the herd unit have been tested for brucellosis and found negative not less than 90 days following the date when the last of the other cattle had been added to the herd unit; or

(ii) All eligible cattle in the herd unit have been tested negative for brucellosis no less than 180 days nor more than 12 months (365 days) following the date when the last of the other cattle had been added to the herd unit.

(c) The certificate accompanying cattle offered for importation from the Republic of Ireland shall show that the cattle are from a brucellosis qualified for export herd and that they meet the following requirements:

(1) The cattle to be exported were not born to or nursed by brucellosis reactors and they were not born in a herd at the time the herd was under quarantine due to brucella infection.

(2) The cattle were placed in an isolation facility approved by a full-time, salaried, Government of Ireland veterinary official, on separate premises a minimum of 500 yards from other livestock not destined for export to the United States for at least 60 days prior to export.

(3) The cattle were negative to the following tests conducted not less than 60 nor more than 120 days from the date of export and a second set of tests conducted within 30 days of the date of export;

(i) Plate or Tube agglutination test conducted in dilutions to detect reactions at 30, 60, 120, and 240 International Units per milliliter (IU/ml);

(ii) Brucellosis card test (Rose Bengal test);

(iii) Complement Fixation (CF) test conducted in dilutions to detect prozone reactions, when present.

(4) Cattle are eligible for entry only if classified as negative at 30 IU to the Plate or Tube agglutination test, negative to the brucellosis card test and negative to the CF test as performed and interpreted by standard methods at the Republic of Ireland Brucellosis Diagnostic Laboratory. Any animal exhibiting a prozone serological reaction is ineligible for export to the United States.

(5) Cattle showing a serological titer more than 60 IU to the Plate or Tube agglutination test, or a reaction to the Brucellosis card test (Rose Bengal) or CF test that would be interpreted to be an infected animal (reactor) under the Republic of Ireland brucellosis control program. Animals from that herd of origin and all other cattle having the opportunity for contact with the reactor animal shall not be eligible for export to the United States. Brucellosis bacteriologically positive animals, if known, regardless of serologic reactions, are not eligible for importation nor are any animals in contact with such animals.

(6) The cattle were moved directly to the port of export from the isolation facility without contact with any other cattle which are not qualified for export to the United States.

(d) The certificate accompanying the cattle offered for importation must also show the dates and places of testing, names of the consignor and consignee, and descriptions of the cattle, including breed, ages, markings, and tattoo and eartag numbers.

(e) In addition to meeting all other applicable requirements of this part, bovines from the Republic of Ireland may be imported only in accordance with ยง 93.436.
