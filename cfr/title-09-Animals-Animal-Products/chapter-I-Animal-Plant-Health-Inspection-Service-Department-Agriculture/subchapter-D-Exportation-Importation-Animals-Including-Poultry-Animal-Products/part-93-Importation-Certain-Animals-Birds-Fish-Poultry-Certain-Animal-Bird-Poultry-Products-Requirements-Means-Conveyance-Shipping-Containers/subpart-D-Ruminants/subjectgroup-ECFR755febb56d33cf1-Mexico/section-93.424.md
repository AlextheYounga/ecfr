(2) A sheep or goat imported for immediate slaughter.

(b) For ruminants intended for importation into the United States from Mexico, the importer or his or her agent shall deliver to the veterinary inspector at the port of entry an application, in writing, for inspection, so that the veterinary inspector and customs representatives may make mutually satisfactory arrangements for the orderly inspection of the animals. For all cattle, except those entering pursuant to the third proviso in § 93.427(d), and except for steers, an official record of negative brucellosis test conducted on the herd of origin as required in § 93.427(d) shall be presented to the veterinary inspector at the port of entry when application is made for inspection. The veterinary inspector at the port of entry will provide the importer or his or her agent with a written statement assigning a date when the animals may be presented for import inspection.
