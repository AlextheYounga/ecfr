##### § 93.324 Detention for quarantine. #####

Horses intended for importation from Mexico shall be quarantined until they qualify for release from such quarantine, either at an APHIS facility designated in § 93.303 (a) or at a facility in Mexico. In order to qualify for such release, all horses while so detained shall test negative to an official test for dourine, glanders, equine piroplasmosis, equine infectious anemia,19 and such other tests that may be required by the Administrator to determine their freedom from other communicable diseases. Such horses shall also be subjected to such other inspections and disinfections deemed necessary by the Administrator, and they shall be released from quarantine only if found to be free from any communicable disease upon inspection.

19 In view of the fact that official test for dourine and glanders are run exclusively at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, Ames, Iowa, protocols for these tests have not been published and are therefore not available; copies of “Protocol for the Complement-Fixation Test for Equine Piroplasmosis” and “Protocol for the Immuno-Diffusion (Coggins) Test for Equine Infectious Anemia” may be obtained from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, Strategy and Policy, 4700 River Road Unit 38, Riverdale, Maryland 20737-1231.
