Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 68863, Dec. 3, 2021.

(a) Except for embryos from sheep in Australia, Canada, or New Zealand, embryos from sheep may only be imported into the United States if they comply with all applicable provisions of this subpart and one of the following conditions:

(1) The embryos are transferred to females in a flock in the United States that participates in the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program (see 9 CFR part 54, subpart B) and qualifies as a “Certified” flock; or

(2) The embryos are transferred to females in a flock in the United States that participates in the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program (see 9 CFR part 54, subpart B) and the flock owner has agreed, in writing, to maintain the flock, and all first generation progeny resulting from embryos imported in accordance with this section, in compliance with all requirements of the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program until the flock, including all first generation progeny resulting from embryos imported in accordance with this section, qualifies as a “Certified” flock.

(b) Sheep embryos may be imported under paragraph (a) of this section only if the importer provides the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program identification number of the receiving flock as part of the application for an import permit.

(c) Sheep embryos may be imported under paragraph (a)(1) of this section only if they are the progeny of a dam and sire that are part of flocks in the region of origin that participate in a program determined by the Administrator to be equivalent to the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program, and the flocks have been determined by the Administrator to be at a level equivalent to “Certified” in the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program.

(d) Sheep embryos may be imported under paragraph (a)(2) of this section only if they are transferred to animals in a Certifiable Class C flock participating in the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program; *except,* that if the embryos are the progeny of a dam and sire whose flock in the region of origin participates in a program determined by the Administrator to be equivalent to the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program, then the embryos may be placed in a flock in the United States which would be classified at a level equivalent to or lower (*i.e.*, at a greater risk) than the certification level, as determined by the Administrator, of either the flock of the dam or the flock of the sire, whichever one presents the greater risk.

(e) The flock to which the sheep embryos are transferred pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section must be monitored for scrapie disease until the flock, and all first generation progeny resulting from the embryos imported in accordance with this section, qualifies as a “Certified” flock.

(f) Except for sheep embryos being placed in Certifiable Class C flocks, the certificate accompanying sheep embryos imported under paragraph (a) of this section must contain the following statement: “The embryos identified on this certificate are the progeny of a dam and sire that have been monitored by a salaried veterinary officer of [*name of region of origin*], for [*number of months*], in the same source flock which had been determined by the Administrator, APHIS, prior to the exportation of these embryos to the United States, to be equivalent to [*certification level (of dam or sire) presenting greater risk*] of the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program authorized under 9 CFR part 54, subpart B.”

(1) The Administrator will determine, based upon information supplied by the importer, whether the flock of the embryos' dam and sire participates in a program in the region of origin that is equivalent to the Voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program, and if so, at what level the source flock would be classified.

(2) In order for the Administrator to make a determination, the importer must supply the following information with the application for an import permit, no less than 1 month prior to the anticipated date of importation:

(i) The name, title, and address of a knowledgeable official in the veterinary services of the region of origin;

(ii) The details of scrapie control programs in the region of origin, including information on disease surveillance and border control activities and the length of time such activities have been in effect;

(iii) Any available information concerning additions, within the 5 years immediately preceding collection of the embryos, to the flock of the embryos' sire and dam;

(iv) Any available data concerning disease incidence, within the 5 years immediately preceding collection of the embryos, in the flock of the embryos' sire and dam, including, but not limited to, the results of diagnostic tests, especially histopathology tests, conducted on any animals in the flock;

(v) Information concerning the health, within the 5 years immediately preceding collection of the embryos, of other ruminants, flocks, and herds with which the embryos' sire and dam and the flock of the embryos' sire and dam might have had physical contact, and a description of the type and frequency of the physical contact; and

(vi) Any other information requested by the Administrator in specific cases as needed to make a determination.

(g) All first generation progeny resulting from embryos imported under this section are subject to the requirements of 9 CFR part 54 and all other applicable regulations.
