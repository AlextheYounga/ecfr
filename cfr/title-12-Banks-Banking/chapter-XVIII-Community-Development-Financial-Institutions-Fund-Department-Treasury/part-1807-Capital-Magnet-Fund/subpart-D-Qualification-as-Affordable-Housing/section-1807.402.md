##### § 1807.402 Affordable Housing—Homeownership. #####

(a) *Purchase with or without Rehabilitation.* A Recipient that uses the CMF Award for the eligible activities set forth in § 1807.301 for Purchase must ensure the purchasing Family and Housing meets the affordability requirements of this subpart.

(1) The Housing must be Single-family housing.

(2) The Single-family housing price does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area as used in the HOME Program and as determined by HUD and the applicable Participating Jurisdiction.

(3) The Single-family housing must be purchased by a qualifying Family as set forth in § 1807.400. The Single-family housing must be the principal residence of the Family throughout the period described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(4) *Periods of affordability.* Single-family housing under this section must meet the affordability requirements for at least 10 years at the time of purchase by the Family.

(5) *Resale.* To ensure that CMF Awards are being used for qualifying Families for the entire 10-year affordability period, recoupment and redeployment or resale strategies must be imposed by the Recipient. A recoupment strategy must ensure that, in the event the qualifying homeowner sells the Housing before the end of the 10-year affordability period and the new homeowner does not meet the affordability qualifications set forth in § 1807.400, an amount equal to the amount of the CMF Award investment in the Housing, whether recouped or not, is used to finance additional Affordable Housing Activities for a qualifying Family in the same income category for Affordable Housing Homeownership in the manner set forth in this section, except that the Housing must meet the affordability requirements only for the remaining duration of the affordability period. The Recipient may design and implement its own recoupment strategy. Deed restrictions, covenants running with the land, or other similar mechanisms may be used as the mechanism to impose a resale strategy. The Recipient shall report to the CDFI Fund the event of resale and/or recoupment and redeployment of the CMF Award, or an equivalent amount, in the manner described in the Assistance Agreement. The affordability restrictions may terminate upon occurrence of any of the following termination events: Foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure, or assignment of an FHA-insured mortgage to HUD. The Recipient may use purchase options, rights of first refusal or other preemptive rights to purchase the Housing before foreclosure to preserve affordability. The affordability restrictions shall be revived according to the original terms if, during the original affordability period, the owner of record before the termination event, obtains an ownership interest in the Housing. If there is a sale of Single-family housing funded by a CMF Award prior to the completion of the 10-year affordability period, the Recipient must demonstrate that it placed into service Single-family housing targeting the same income population (*i.e.,* Extremely Low-Income, Very Low-Income, Low-Income) as the original Single-family housing, as set forth in the Assistance Agreement, financed with an equivalent amount to the recouped portion of the CMF Award, that will be tracked for the duration of the affordability period of the original Single-family housing.

(b) *Rehabilitation not involving Purchase.* Single-family housing that is currently owned by a qualifying Family, as set forth in § 1807.400, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the requirements of this paragraph (b).

(1) The estimated value of the Single-family housing, after Rehabilitation, does not exceed 95 percent of the median purchase price for the area, as used in the HOME Program and as determined by the applicable Participating Jurisdiction; or

(2) The Single-family housing is the principal residence of a qualifying Family as set forth in § 1807.400, at the time that the CMF Award is Committed to the Single-family housing.

(3) Single-family housing under this paragraph (b) must meet the affordability requirements for at least 10 years after Rehabilitation is completed or meet the resale provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

(c) *Ownership interest.* The ownership in the Single-family housing assisted under this section must meet the definition of Homeownership as defined in § 1807.104.

(d) *New construction without Purchase.* Newly constructed Single-family housing that is built on property currently owned by a Family that will occupy the Single-family housing upon completion, qualifies as Affordable Housing if it meets the requirements under paragraph (a) of this section.

(e) *Converting rental units to Homeownership units for existing tenants.* CMF-financed rental units may be converted to Homeownership units by selling, donating, or otherwise conveying the units to the existing tenants to enable the tenants to become homeowners in accordance with the requirements of this section. The Homeownership units are subject to a minimum period of affordability equal to the remaining affordability period.
