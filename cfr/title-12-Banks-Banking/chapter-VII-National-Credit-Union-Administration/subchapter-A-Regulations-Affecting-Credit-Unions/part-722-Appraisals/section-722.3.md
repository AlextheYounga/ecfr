##### § 722.3 Appraisals required; transactions requiring a State certified or licensed appraiser. #####

(a) *Appraisals required.* An appraisal performed by a State certified or licensed appraiser is required for all real estate-related financial transactions except those in which:

(1) The transaction value is $250,000 or less;

(2) A lien on real property has been taken as collateral through an abundance of caution and where the terms of the transaction as a consequence have not been made more favorable than they would have been in the absence of a lien;

(3) A lien on real estate has been taken for purposes other than the real estate's value;

(4) A lease of real estate is entered into, unless the lease is the economic equivalent of a purchase or sale of the leased real estate;

(5) The transaction involves an existing extension of credit at the lending credit union, provided that:

(i) There is no advancement of new monies, other than funds necessary to cover reasonable closing costs; or

(ii) There has been no obvious and material change in market conditions or physical aspects of the property that threatens the adequacy of the credit union's real estate collateral protection after the transaction, even with the advancement of new monies;

(6) The transaction involves the purchase, sale, investment in, exchange of, or extension of credit secured by, a loan or interest in a loan, pooled loans, or interests in real property, including mortgage-backed securities, and each loan or interest in a loan, pooled loan, or real property interest met the requirements of this regulation, if applicable, at the time of origination;

(7) The transaction is wholly or partially insured or guaranteed by a United States government agency or United States government sponsored agency;

(8) The transaction either:

(i) Qualifies for sale to a United States government agency or United States government sponsored agency; or

(ii) Involves a residential real estate transaction in which the appraisal conforms to the Federal National Mortgage Association or Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation appraisal standards applicable to that category of real estate; or

(9) The regional director has granted a waiver from the appraisal requirement for a category of loans meeting the definition of a member business loan.

(b) *Transactions requiring a State-certified appraiser.* (1) (All transactions of $1,000,000 or more) All federally related transactions having a transaction value of $1,000,000 or more shall require an appraisal prepared by a state-certified appraiser.

(2) (Nonresidential transactions) All federally related transactions having a transaction value of more than $250,000, other than those involving appraisals of 1- to 4-family residential properties, shall require an appraisal prepared by a state-certified appraiser.

(3) (Complex residential transactions of $250,000 or more) All complex 1- to 4-family residential property appraisals rendered in connection with federally related transactions shall require a state-certified appraiser if the transaction value is $250,000 or more. A regulated institution may presume that appraisals of 1- to 4-family residential properties are not complex unless the institution has readily available information that a given appraisal will be complex. The regulated institution shall be responsible for making the final determination of whether the appraisal is complex. If, during the course of the appraisal, a licensed appraiser identifies factors that would result in the property, form of ownership, or market conditions being considered atypical, then either:

(i) The regulated institution may ask the licensed appraiser to complete the appraisal and have a certified appraiser approve and cosign the appraisal; or

(ii) The institution may engage a certified appraiser to complete the appraisal.

(c) *Transactions requiring either a State-certified or -licensed appraiser.* All appraisals for federally related transactions not requiring the services of a state-certified appraiser shall be prepared by either a state-certified appraiser or a state-licensed appraiser.

(d) *Valuation requirement.* Secured transactions exempted from appraisal requirements pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(5) of this section and not otherwise exempted from this regulation or fully insured shall be supported by a written estimate of market value, as defined in this regulation, performed by an individual having no direct or indirect interest in the property, and qualified and experienced to perform such estimates of value for the type and amount of credit being considered.

(e) *Appraisals to address safety and soundness concerns.* NCUA reserves the right to require an appraisal under this subpart whenever the agency believes it is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns.

(f) *Higher-priced mortgage loans.* A credit union may not extend credit to a consumer in the form of a “higher-priced mortgage loan” as defined in 12 CFR 1026.35(a)(1), without meeting the requirements of section 129H of the Truth in Lending Act, 15 U.S.C. 1639h, and its implementing regulations in Regulation Z, 12 CFR 1026.35(c).
