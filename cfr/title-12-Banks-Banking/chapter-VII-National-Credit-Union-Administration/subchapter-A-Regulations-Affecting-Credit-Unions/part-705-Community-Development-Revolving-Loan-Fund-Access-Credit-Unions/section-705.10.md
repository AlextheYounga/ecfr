##### § 705.10 Appeals. #####

(a) *Appeals of non-qualification.* A Qualifying Credit Union whose application for a loan or technical assistance grant has been denied, under § 705.7(f), for failure of a qualification may appeal that decision to the NCUA Board in accordance with the following:

(1) Within thirty days of its receipt of a notice of non-qualification, a credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. The scope of the NCUA Board's review is limited to the threshold question of qualification and not the issue of whether, among qualified applicants, a particular loan or technical assistance grant is funded.

(2) The foregoing procedure shall apply only with respect to Applications received by NCUA during an open period in which funds are available and NCUA has called for Applications. Any Application submitted by an applicant during a period in which NCUA has not called for Applications will be rejected, except for those Applications submitted under § 705.8. Any such rejection shall not be subject to appeal or review by the NCUA Board.

(b) *Appeals of technical assistance grant reimbursement denials.* Pursuant to NCUA Interpretative Ruling and Policy Statement 11-1, any Participating Credit Union may appeal a denial of a technical assistance grant reimbursement to NCUA's Supervisory Review Committee. All appeals of technical assistance grant reimbursements must be submitted to the Supervisory Review Committee within 30 days from the date of the denial. The decisions of the Supervisory Review Committee are final and may not be appealed to the NCUA Board.
