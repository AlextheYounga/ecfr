(ii) Contain a summary of the merger plan, including, but not necessarily limited to, current financial statements for each credit union, a consolidated financial statement for the continuing credit union, analyses of share values, explanation of any proposed share adjustments, explanation of any changes relative to insurance such as life savings and loan protection insurance and insurance of member accounts, and a detailed description of any merger related financial arrangement, as defined in § 708b.2. The description must include the name and title of each individual recipient and an explanation of the financial impact of each element of the arrangement, including direct salary increases and any indirect compensation, such as any bonus, deferred compensation or other financial reward;

(b) Approval of a proposal to merge a federal credit union into a federally-insured credit union requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the merging credit union who vote on the proposal. If the continuing credit union is uninsured or nonfederally-insured, the voting requirements of subpart B apply. If the continuing credit union is nonfederally-insured, the merging credit union must use the form notice and ballot in subpart C of this part unless the Regional Director approves the use of different forms.
