##### § 708b.303 Conversion of insurance through merger. #####

Unless the Regional Director approves the use of different forms, a federally-insured credit union that is merging into a nonfederally-insured credit union must use the forms in this section.

(a) Form notice to members of intent to merge and convert and special meeting of members:

Notice of Special Meeting on Proposal To Merge and Convert to Nonfederally-Insured Status(Insert Name of Merging Credit Union)

On (insert date), the Board of Directors of your credit union approved a proposition to merge with (insert name of continuing credit union) and to convert from federal share (deposit) insurance to private insurance. You are encouraged to attend a special meeting of our credit union at (insert address) on (insert time and date).

Purpose of Meeting

The meeting has two purposes:

1. To consider and act upon a proposal to merge our credit union with (insert name of continuing credit union), the continuing credit union.

2. To approve the action of the Board of Directors of our credit union in authorizing the officers of the credit union, subject to member approval, to carry out the proposed merger.

If this merger is approved, our credit union will transfer all its assets and liabilities to the continuing credit union. As a member of our credit union, you will become a member of the continuing credit union. On the effective date of the merger, you will receive shares in the continuing credit union for the shares you own now in our credit union.

Insurance Conversion

Currently, your accounts have share insurance provided by the National Credit Union Administration, an agency of the federal government. The basic federal coverage is up to $100,000, but accounts may be structured in different ways, such as joint accounts, payable-on-death accounts, or IRA accounts, to achieve federal coverage of much more than $100,000. If the merger is approved, your federal insurance will terminate on the effective date of the merger. Instead, your accounts in the credit union will be insured up to $(insert dollar amount) by (insert name of insurer), a corporation chartered by the State of (insert name of State). The federal insurance provided by the National Credit Union Administration is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. The private insurance you will receive from (insert name of insurer), however, is not guaranteed by the federal or any state or local government.

|IF THIS MERGER IS APPROVED AND THE (insert name of continuing|
|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
|    credit union) FAILS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT     |
|           GUARANTEE YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEY BACK.           |

Also, because this merger, if approved, would result in the loss of federal share insurance, the (insert name of merging credit union) will, at any time between the approval of the merger and the effective date of merger and upon request of the member, permit all members who have share certificates or other term accounts to close the federally-insured portion of those accounts without an early withdrawal penalty. (This is an optional sentence. It may be deleted without the approval of the Regional Director. The members must be informed about this right, however, as described in 12 CFR 708b.204(c).)
