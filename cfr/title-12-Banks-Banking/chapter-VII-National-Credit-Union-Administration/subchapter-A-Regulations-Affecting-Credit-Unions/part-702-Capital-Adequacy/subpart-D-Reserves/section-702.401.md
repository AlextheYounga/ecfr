##### § 702.401 Reserves. #####

(a) *Special reserve.* Each federally-insured credit union shall establish and maintain such reserves as may be required by the FCUA, by state law, by regulation, or in special cases by the NCUA Board or appropriate State official.

(b) *Regular reserve.* Each federally-insured credit union shall establish and maintain a regular reserve account for the purpose of absorbing losses that exceed undivided earnings and other appropriations of undivided earnings, subject to paragraph (c) of this section. Earnings required to be transferred annually to a credit union's regular reserve under subparts B or C of this part shall be held in this account.

(c) *Charges to regular reserve after depleting undivided earnings.* The board of directors of a federally-insured credit union may authorize losses to be charged to the regular reserve after first depleting the balance of the undivided earnings account and other reserves, provided that the authorization states the amount and provides an explanation of the need for the charge, and either -

(1) The charge will not cause the credit union's net worth classification to fall below “adequately capitalized” under subparts B or C of this part; or

(2) If the charge will cause the net worth classification to fall below “adequately capitalized,” the appropriate Regional Director and, if State-chartered, the appropriate State official, have given written approval (in an NWRP or otherwise) for the charge.

(d) *Transfers to regular reserve.* The transfer of earnings to a federally-insured credit union's regular reserve account when required under subparts B or C of this part must occur after charges for loan or other losses are addressed as provided in paragraph (c) of this section and § 702.402(d), but before payment of any dividends to members.
