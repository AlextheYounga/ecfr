##### § 702.301 Scope and definition. #####

(a) *Scope.* This subpart C applies in lieu of subpart B of this part exclusively to credit unions defined in paragraph (b) of this section as “new” pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 1790d(b)(2).

(b) *New credit union defined.* A “new” credit union for purposes of this subpart is a federally-insured credit union that both has been in operation for less than ten (10) years and has total assets of not more than $10 million. A credit union which exceeds $10 million in total assets may become “new” if its total assets subsequently decline below $10 million while it is still in operation for less than 10 years.

(c) *Effect of spin-offs.* A credit union formed as the result of a “spin-off” of a group from the field of membership of an existing credit union is deemed to be in operation since the effective date of the “spin-off.” A credit union whose total assets decline below $10 million because a group within its field of membership has been “spun-off” is deemed “new” if it has been in operation less than 10 years.

(d) *Actions to evade prompt corrective action.* If the NCUA Board determines that a credit union was formed, or was reduced in asset size as a result of a “spin-off,” or was merged, primarily to qualify as “new” under this subpart, the credit union shall be deemed subject to prompt corrective action under subpart A of this part.
