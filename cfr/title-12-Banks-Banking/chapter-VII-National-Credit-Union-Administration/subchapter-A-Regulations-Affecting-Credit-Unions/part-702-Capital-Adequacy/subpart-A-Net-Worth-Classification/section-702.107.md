A credit union may substitute one or more alternative components below, in place of the corresponding standard components in ยง 702.106 above, when any alternative component amount, expressed as a percentage of the credit union's quarter-end total assets as reflected in its most recent Call Report, rounded to two decimal places, is smaller (Table 5):

(iii) Fourteen percent (14%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 20 years;

(2) *Callable.* Long-term real estate loans callable in 5 years or less as follows:

(ii) Ten percent (10%) of the amount of such loans with a documented call provision of 5 years or less and with a remaining maturity of greater than 12 years, but less than or equal to 20 years; and

(iii) Twelve percent (12%) of the amount of such loans with a documented call provision of 5 years or less and with a remaining maturity of greater than 20 years;

(b) *Member business loans outstanding.* The sum of:

(1) *Fixed rate.* Fixed-rate member business loans outstanding as follows:

(i) Six percent (6%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity of 3 or fewer years;

(ii) Nine percent (9%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 3 years, but less than or equal to 5 years;

(iii) Twelve percent (12%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 5 years, but less than or equal to 7 years;

(iv) Fourteen percent (14%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 7 years, but less than or equal to 12 years; and

(v) Sixteen percent (16%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 12 years; and

(2) *Variable-rate.* Variable-rate member business loans outstanding as follows:

(i) Six percent (6%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity of 3 or fewer years;

(ii) Eight percent (8%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 3 years, but less than or equal to 5 years;

(iii) Ten percent (10%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 5 years, but less than or equal to 7 years;

(iv) Twelve percent (12%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 7 years, but less than or equal to 12 years; and

(v) Fourteen percent (14%) of the amount of such loans with a remaining maturity greater than 12 years.

(c) *Investments.* The sum of:

(1) Three percent (3%) of the amount of investments with a weighted-average life (as specified in ยง 702.105 above) of one (1) year or less;

(2) Six percent (6%) of the amount of investments with a weighted-average life greater than one (1) year, but less than or equal to three (3) years;

(3) Eight percent (8%) of the amount of investments with a weighted-average life greater than three (3) years, but less than or equal to five (5) years;

(4) Twelve percent (12%) of the amount of investments with a weighted-average life greater than five (5) years, but less than or equal to seven (7) years;

(5) Sixteen percent (16%) of the amount of investments with a weighted-average life greater than seven (7) years, but less than or equal to ten (10) years; and

(6) Twenty percent (20%) of the amount of investments with a weighted-average life greater than ten (10) years.

(d) *Loans sold with recourse.* The alternative component is the sum of:
