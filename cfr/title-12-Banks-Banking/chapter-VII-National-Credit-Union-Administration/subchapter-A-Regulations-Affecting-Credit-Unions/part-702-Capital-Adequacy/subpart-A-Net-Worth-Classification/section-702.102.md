(b) *Reclassification based on supervisory criteria other than net worth.* The NCUA Board may reclassify a “well capitalized” credit union as “adequately capitalized” and may require an “adequately capitalized” or “undercapitalized” credit union to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower net worth category (each of such actions hereinafter referred to generally as “reclassification”) in the following circumstances:

(1) *Unsafe or unsound condition.* The NCUA Board has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to § 747.2003 of this chapter, that the credit union is in an unsafe or unsound condition; or

(2) *Unsafe or unsound practice.* The NCUA Board has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to § 747.2003 of this chapter, that the credit union has not corrected a material unsafe or unsound practice of which it was, or should have been, aware.

(c) *Non-delegation.* The NCUA Board may not delegate its authority to reclassify a credit union under paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) *Consultation with State officials.* The NCUA Board shall consult and seek to work cooperatively with the appropriate State official before reclassifying a federally-insured State-chartered credit union under paragraph (b) of this section, and shall promptly notify the appropriate State official of its decision to reclassify.
