Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 72804, Dec. 23, 2021.

(a) *Net worth measures.* For purposes of this part, a credit union must determine its net worth category classification at the end of each calendar quarter using two measures:

(1) The net worth ratio as defined in § 702.2(g); and

(2) If determined to be applicable under § 702.103, a risk-based net worth requirement.

(b) *Effective date of net worth classification.* For purposes of this part, the effective date of a federally insured credit union's net worth category classification shall be the most recent to occur of:

(1) *Quarter-end effective date.* The last day of the calendar month following the end of the calendar quarter; or

(2) *Corrected net worth category.* The date the credit union received subsequent written notice from NCUA or, if State-chartered, from the appropriate State official, of a decline in net worth category due to correction of an error or misstatement in the credit union's most recent Call Report; or

(3) *Reclassification to lower category.* The date the credit union received written notice from NCUA or, if State-chartered, the appropriate State official, of reclassification on safety and soundness grounds as provided under § 702.102(b) or § 702.302(d).

(c) *Notice to NCUA by filing Call Report.* (1) Other than by filing a Call Report, a federally insured credit union need not notify the NCUA Board of a change in its net worth ratio that places the credit union in a lower net worth category;

(2) Failure to timely file a Call Report as required under this section in no way alters the effective date of a change in net worth classification under this paragraph (b) of this section, or the affected credit union's corresponding legal obligations under this part.
