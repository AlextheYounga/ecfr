##### § 702.405 Disclosures. #####

(a) An Issuing Credit Union must disclose the following language clearly, in all capital letters, on the face of a Subordinated Debt Note:

• THIS OBLIGATION IS NOT A SHARE IN THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION AND IS NOT INSURED BY THE NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION.

• THIS OBLIGATION IS UNSECURED AND SUBORDINATE TO ALL CLAIMS AGAINST THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION AND IS INELIGIBLE AS COLLATERAL FOR A LOAN BY THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION.

• AMOUNTS OTHERWISE PAYABLE HEREUNDER MAY BE REDUCED IN ORDER TO COVER ANY DEFICIT IN RETAINED EARNINGS OF THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION. AMOUNTS APPLIED TO COVER ANY SUCH DEFICIT WILL RESULT IN A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ALL OUTSTANDING SUBORDINATED DEBT ISSUED BY THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION, AND WILL NO LONGER BE DUE AND PAYABLE TO THE HOLDERS OF SUCH SUBORDINATED DEBT. AMOUNTS APPLIED TO COVER ANY SUCH DEFICIT MUST BE APPLIED AMONG ALL HOLDERS OF SUCH SUBORDINATED DEBT PRO RATA BASED ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUBORDINATED DEBT OWED BY THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION TO EACH SUCH HOLDER AT THE TIME OF APPLICATION.

• THIS OBLIGATION CAN ONLY BE REPAID AT MATURITY OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH 12 CFR 702.411. THIS OBLIGATION MAY ALSO BE REPAID IN ACCORDANCE WITH 12 CFR PART 710 IF THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION VOLUNTARILY LIQUIDATES.

• THE NOTE EVIDENCING THIS OBLIGATION HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, AND MAY BE ISSUED, SOLD, PLEDGED, OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED ONLY (A) AS PERMITTED IN THE NOTE AND TO A PERSON WHOM THE ISSUER OR SELLER REASONABLY BELIEVES IS [AN “ACCREDITED INVESTOR” (AS DEFINED IN 12 CFR 702.402)] [AN “ENTITY ACCREDITED INVESTOR” (AS DEFINED IN 12 CFR 702.402)] (THAT IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION'S BOARD, A SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN 12 CFR 702.402), OR ANY IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER OF ANY SUCH BOARD MEMBER OR SENIOR EXECUTIVE OFFICER), PURCHASING FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT, (1) TO WHOM NOTICE IS GIVEN THAT THE SALE, PLEDGE, OR OTHER TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON THE EXEMPTION FROM SECURITIES ACT REGISTRATION PROVIDED BY SECTION 3(a)(5) OF THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (2) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANOTHER EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT (SUBJECT TO THE DELIVERY OF SUCH CERTIFICATIONS, LEGAL OPINIONS, OR OTHER INFORMATION AS THE ISSUING CREDIT UNION MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT SUCH SALE, PLEDGE, OR TRANSFER IS BEING MADE PURSUANT TO AN EXEMPTION FROM, OR IN A TRANSACTION NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT), (B) IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CERTIFICATION AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN THE [INDENTURE OR OTHER DOCUMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH THE SUBORDINATED DEBT NOTE IS ISSUED] REFERRED TO HEREIN, AND (C) IN ACCORDANCE WITH ANY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES AND ANY OTHER APPLICATION JURISDICTION.

(b) An Issuing Credit Union must also clearly and accurately disclose in the Subordinated Debt Note:

(1) The payout priority and level of subordination, as described in § 709.5(b) of this chapter, that would apply in the event of the involuntary liquidation of the Issuing Credit Union;

(2) A general description of the NCUA's regulatory authority that includes, at a minimum:

(i) If the Issuing Credit Union is “undercapitalized” or, if the Issuing Credit Union is a New Credit Union, “moderately capitalized” (each as defined in this part), and fails to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan, capital restoration plan, or revised business plan, as applicable, or materially fails to implement such a plan that was approved by the NCUA, the Issuing Credit Union may be subject to all of the additional restrictions and requirements applicable to a “significantly undercapitalized” credit union or, if the Issuing Credit Union is a new credit union, a “marginally capitalized” new credit union; and

(ii) Beginning 60 days after the effective date of an Issuing Credit Union being classified as “critically undercapitalized” or, in the case of a new credit union, “uncapitalized,” the Issuing Credit Union shall not pay principal of or interest on its Subordinated Debt, until reauthorized to do so by the NCUA; provided, however, that unpaid interest shall continue to accrue under the terms of the Subordinated Debt Note, to the extent permitted by law; and

(3) The risk factors associated with the NCUA's or, if applicable, the state supervisory authority's, authority to conserve or liquidate a credit union under the Federal Credit Union Act (FCU Act) or applicable state law.
