##### § 703.111 NCUA approval. #####

(a) *Interim approval.* The field director will notify the Federal credit union in writing if the field director has approved or denied its application and, if applicable, the reason(s) for any denial. A Federal credit union approved for derivatives authority may not enter into any derivatives transactions until it receives final approval from NCUA under paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) *Notice of readiness.* A Federal credit union approved under paragraph (a) of this section must provide written notification to NCUA when it is ready to begin using derivatives.

(c) *Final approval.* NCUA will review every approved Federal credit union's derivatives program to ensure compliance with this subpart and evaluate the Federal credit union's implementation of the items in its application. This supervisory review may be conducted on site. After NCUA has completed its review, the field director will notify the Federal credit union in writing if the field director has granted final approval and the Federal credit union may begin entering into derivatives transactions. If applicable, the notification will include the reason(s) for any denial. A Federal credit union may not enter into any derivatives transactions under this subpart until it receives this determination from the applicable field director. At a field director's discretion, a Federal credit union may reapply under this subsection if the field director has determined that the Federal credit union has demonstrated compliance with this subpart and its application.

(d) *Right to appeal.* A Federal credit union may request the field director to reconsider a determination made under paragraph (a) or (c) of this section and/or file an appeal with the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to part 746 of this chapter.
