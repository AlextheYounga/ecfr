##### § 703.114 Regulatory violation. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 50293, Oct. 30, 2017.

(a) A Federal credit union with derivatives authority that no longer meets the requirements of this subpart or fails to comply with its approved strategy (including employing the resources, policies, procedures, accounting, and competencies that formed the basis for the approval) must:

(1) Immediately stop entering into any new derivatives transactions until the Federal credit union is in compliance with this subpart. During this period, however, the Federal credit union may terminate existing derivatives transactions. NCUA may permit a Federal credit union to enter into offsetting transactions if NCUA determines these transactions are part of a corrective action strategy.

(2) Within three business days from the regulatory violation, provide the appropriate field director notification of the regulatory violation, which must include a description of the violation and the immediate corrective action the Federal credit union is taking; and

(3) Within 15 business days after notifying the appropriate field director, submit a written corrective action plan to the appropriate field director.

(b) NCUA may revoke a Federal credit union's derivatives authority at any time if a Federal credit union fails to comply with the requirements of this subpart. Revocation will prohibit a Federal credit union from executing any new derivatives transactions under this subpart, and may require the Federal credit union to terminate existing derivatives transactions if, in the discretion of the applicable field director, doing so would not pose a safety and soundness concern.

(c) Within 60 days from the date of the related field director's action, a Federal credit union may appeal the following to the NCUA Board:

(1) NCUA's revocation of a Federal credit union's derivatives authority; and

(2) NCUA's order that a Federal credit union terminate existing derivatives positions.

(d) With respect to an appeal regarding revocation of a Federal credit union's derivatives authority, the Federal credit union may not enter into any new derivatives transactions until the NCUA Board renders a final decision on the appeal. The Federal credit union may, however, elect to terminate existing derivatives positions. With respect to an appeal regarding an order to terminate a Federal credit union's existing derivatives positions, the Federal credit union is not required to terminate any existing positions until the NCUA Board renders a final decision on the appeal.

(3) Through the originator's initial written communication with a consumer, if any, whether on paper or electronically.
