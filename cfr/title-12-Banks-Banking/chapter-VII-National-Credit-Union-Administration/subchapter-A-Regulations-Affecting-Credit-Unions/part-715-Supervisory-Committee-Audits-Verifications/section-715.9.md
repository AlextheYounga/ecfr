(5) Provide that the auditor shall, upon completion of the engagement, deliver to the Supervisory Committee a written report of the audit and notice in writing, either within the report or communicated separately, of any internal control reportable conditions and/or irregularities or illegal acts, if any, which come to the auditor's attention during the normal course of the audit (i.e., no notice required if none noted);

(6) Specify a target date of delivery of the written reports, such target date not to exceed 120 days from date of calendar or fiscal year-end under audit (period covered), unless the supervisory committee obtains a waiver from the supervising NCUA Regional Director;
