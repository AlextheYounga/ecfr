##### § 704.11 Corporate Credit Union Service Organizations (Corporate CUSOs). #####

(a) A corporate CUSO is an entity that:

(1) Is at least partly owned by a corporate credit union;

(2) Primarily serves credit unions;

(3) Restricts its services to those related to the normal course of business of credit unions as specified in paragraph (e) of this section; and

(4) Is structured as a corporation, limited liability company, or limited partnership under state law.

(b) *Investment and loan limitations.* (1) The aggregate of all investments in member and non-member corporate CUSOs that a corporate credit union may make must not exceed 15 percent of a corporate credit union's total capital.

(2) The aggregate of all investments in and loans to member and nonmember corporate CUSOs a corporate credit union may make must not exceed 30 percent of a corporate credit union's total capital. A corporate credit union may lend to member and nonmember corporate credit union CUSOs an additional 15 percent of total capital if the loan is collateralized by assets in which the corporate has a perfected security interest under state law.

(3) If the limitations in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section are reached or exceeded because of the profitability of the CUSO and the related GAAP valuation of the investment under the equity method without an additional cash outlay by the corporate credit union, divestiture is not required. A corporate credit union may continue to invest up to the regulatory limit without regard to the increase in the GAAP valuation resulting from the corporate CUSO's profitability.

(c) *Due diligence.* A corporate credit union must comply with the due diligence requirements of §§ 723.5 and 723.6(f) through (j) of this chapter for all loans to corporate CUSOs. This requirement does not apply to loans excluded under § 723.1(b).

(d) *Separate entity.* (1) A corporate CUSO must be operated as an entity separate from a corporate credit union.

(2) A corporate credit union investing in or lending to a corporate CUSO must obtain a written legal opinion that concludes the corporate CUSO is organized and operated in a manner that the corporate credit union will not reasonably be held liable for the obligations of the corporate CUSO. This opinion must address factors that have led courts to “pierce the corporate veil,” such as inadequate capitalization, lack of corporate identity, common boards of directors and employees, control of one entity over another, and lack of separate books and records.

(e) *Permissible activities.* (1) A corporate CUSO must agree to limit its activities to:

(i) Brokerage services,

(ii) Investment advisory services, and

(iii) Other categories of activities as approved in writing by NCUA and published on NCUA's Web site.

(2) Once NCUA has approved an activity and published that activity on its Web site as provided for in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section, NCUA will not remove that particular activity from the approved list, or make substantial changes to the content or description of that approved activity, except through the formal rulemaking process.

(f) An official of a corporate credit union which has invested in or loaned to a corporate CUSO may not receive, either directly or indirectly, any salary, commission, investment income, or other income, compensation, or consideration from the corporate CUSO. This prohibition also extends to immediate family members of officials.

(g) Prior to making an investment in or loan to a corporate CUSO, a corporate credit union must obtain a written agreement that the CUSO:

(1) Will follow GAAP;

(2) Will provide financial statements to the corporate credit union at least quarterly;

(3) Will obtain an annual CPA opinion audit and provide a copy to the corporate credit union. A wholly owned or majority owned CUSO is not required to obtain a separate annual audit if it is included in the corporate credit union's annual consolidated audit;

(4) Will provide the reports as required by § 712.3(d)(4) and (5) of this chapter;

(5) Will not acquire control, directly or indirectly, of another depository financial institution or to invest in shares, stocks, or obligations of an insurance company, trade association, liquidity facility, or similar organization;

(6) Will allow the auditor, board of directors, and NCUA complete access to the CUSO's personnel, facilities, equipment, books, records, and any other documentation that the auditor, directors, or NCUA deem pertinent;

(7) Will inform the corporate credit union, at least quarterly, of all the compensation paid by the CUSO to its employees who are also employees of the corporate credit union; and

(8) Will comply with all the requirements of this section.

(h) Corporate credit union authority to invest in or loan to a CUSO is limited to that provided in this section. A corporate credit union is not authorized to invest in or loan to a CUSO under part 712 of this chapter.
