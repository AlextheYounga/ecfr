Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 50294, Oct. 30, 2017.

(a) *Time for filing.* Within 60 days after issuance of an initial determination, or of the determination on a request for reconsideration by the liquidating agent, the accountholder may appeal by filing with the Board a written request for appeal. The appeal may be filed with the Secretary of the Board, National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-3428.

(b) *Content of request.* Any appeal must include:

(1) A statement of the facts on which the claim for insurance is based;

(2) A statement of the basis for the initial determination or determination on the request for reconsideration to which the accountholder objects and the alleged error in such determination, including citations to applicable statutes and regulations;

(3) Any other evidence relied upon by the accountholder which was not previously provided to the Liquidating Agent.

(c) *Procedures for review of request.* (1) Within 60 days of the date of the Board's receipt of an appeal, the Board may request in writing that the accountholder submit additional facts and records in support of its request. The accountholder shall have 45 days from the date of issuance of such written request to provide such additional information. Failure by the accountholder to provide additional information may, as determined solely by the Board, result in denial of the accountholder's appeal.

(2) Within 60 days from the date of the Board's receipt of an appeal, the accountholder may amend or supplement the request in writing. In the event that the accountholder does amend or supplement the request, the provisons of paragraph (c)(1) of this section with respect to requests for additional information and responses to such requests shall apply with equal force to any such amendment or supplement to a request.

(d) *Determination on appeal.* (1) Within 180 days from the date of the receipt of an appeal by the Board, the Board shall issue a decision determining the extent of the accountholder's insurance pursuant to the rules of this part.

(2) The determination by the Board on appeal shall be provided to the accountholder in writing, stating the reason(s) for the determination, and shall constitute a final Agency order regarding the accountholder's claim for insurance.

(3) If the Board determines that the accountholder is entitled to the amount of insurance claimed or a portion thereof, upon payment of such insurance the accountholder shall promptly surrender to the Board the certificate of claim in liquidation provided in connection with the initial determination. In the event that the Board determines that the accountholder is only entitled to a portion of the amount of insurance claimed, upon the accountholder's surrender of such certificate a new certificate of claim in liquidation will be provided which reflects the revised amount of the uninsured account.

(4) Failure by the Board to issue a determination on appeal of the accountholder's claim for insurance within the 180-day period provided for under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall be deemed to be a denial of such claim for purposes of § 745.203 of this subpart.
