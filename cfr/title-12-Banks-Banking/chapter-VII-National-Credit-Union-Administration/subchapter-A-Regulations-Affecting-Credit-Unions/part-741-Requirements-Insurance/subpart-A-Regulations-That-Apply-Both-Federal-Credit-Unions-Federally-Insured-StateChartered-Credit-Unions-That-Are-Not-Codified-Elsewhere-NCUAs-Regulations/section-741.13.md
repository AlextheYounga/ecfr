(5) *Calculation of pro rata share of NCUSIF equity distribution.* The Board shall determine a financial institution's pro rata share of an NCUSIF equity distribution by dividing the dollar amount of the declared NCUSIF equity distribution by the aggregate average amount of insured shares for that given time horizon and then multiplying by a financial institution's average amount of insured shares.

(i) *Time horizons.* When calculating the average amount of insured shares and the aggregate average amount of insured shares for an NCUSIF equity distribution, the following time horizons shall apply:

(A) *NCUSIF equity distribution for 2017.* The average amount of insured shares and aggregate average amount of insured shares for an NCUSIF equity distribution declared for calendar year 2017 shall be based on information from quarterly Call Reports from the preceding 36 quarters, including the calendar year-end Call Report for 2017.

(B) *NCUSIF equity distribution for 2018.* The average amount of insured shares and aggregate average amount of insured shares for an NCUSIF equity distribution declared for calendar year 2018 shall be based on information from quarterly Call Reports from the preceding 40 quarters, including the calendar year-end Call Report for 2018.

(C) *NCUSIF equity distribution for 2019.* The average amount of insured shares and aggregate average amount of insured shares for an NCUSIF equity distribution declared for calendar year 2019 shall be based on information from quarterly Call Reports from the preceding 44 quarters, including the calendar year-end Call Report for 2019.

(D) *NCUSIF equity distribution for 2020.* The average amount of insured shares and aggregate average amount of insured shares for an NCUSIF equity distribution declared for calendar year 2020 shall be based on information from quarterly Call Reports from the preceding 48 quarters, including the calendar year-end Call Report for 2020.

(ii) *Special rules.* The following special rules shall apply to newly-chartered federally insured credit unions, financial institutions that convert to federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF, financial institutions that terminate federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF, mergers between federally insured credit unions, and purchase and assumption transactions:

(A) *New charters.* A newly chartered federally insured credit union that obtains federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year shall not receive an NCUSIF equity distribution for that calendar year unless the federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year. For purposes of calculating the newly chartered federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, the federally insured credit union shall be treated as having no insured shares for reporting periods preceding the first reporting period in which the federally insured credit union files its first quarterly Call Report.

(B) *Conversion to federal share insurance.* A financial institution that converts to federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution (including through merger into a federally insured credit union) shall receive a prorated NCUSIF equity distribution for that calendar year provided that the financial institution has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year. For purposes of calculating the financial institution's average amount of insured shares, the financial institution shall be treated as having no insured shares for reporting periods preceding the date of conversion to federal share insurance coverage. In cases of conversion through merger, only the insured shares attributable to the continuing federally insured credit union shall be used to determine the average amount of insured shares for reporting periods preceding the date of conversion.

(C) *Conversion from, or termination of, federal share insurance.* A financial institution that terminates federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF during the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution (including through a conversion to, or merger into, a non-federally insured credit union or an insured depository institution) shall receive a prorated NCUSIF equity distribution for that calendar year provided that the financial institution has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year. For purposes of calculating the financial institution's average amount of insured shares, the financial institution shall be treated as having no insured shares for reporting periods following the date of termination of federal share insurance coverage. For purposes of this subparagraph, a financial institution that terminates federal share insurance coverage from the NCUSIF through liquidation will be treated as terminating federal share insurance coverage during the calendar year when it enters liquidation.

(D) *Mergers between federally insured credit unions.* A continuing federally insured credit union that merges with a federally insured credit union shall receive an equity distribution equivalent to what the continuing federally insured credit union and the merging federally insured credit union would have received separately but for the consummation of the merger provided that the merging federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board declares the distribution. For purposes of calculating the continuing federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, any insured shares previously reported by the merging federally insured credit union on its quarterly Call Reports filed prior to the consummation of the merger during that calendar year for which the Board declares the distribution shall be combined with the insured shares reported on the continuing federally insured credit union's quarterly Call Reports.

(E) *Purchase and assumption transactions.* A federally insured credit union that acquires all of the insured shares of another federally insured credit union in the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution shall receive an amount equivalent to what the acquiring federally insured credit union and the selling federally insured credit union would have received but for the consummation of the purchase and assumption transaction provided that the selling federally insured credit union has filed at least one quarterly Call Report as a federally insured credit union for a reporting period in the calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution. For purposes of calculating the acquiring federally insured credit union's average amount of insured shares, any insured shares previously reported during that calendar year for which the Board declares an NCUSIF equity distribution by the selling federally insured credit union on its quarterly Call Reports filed prior to the consummation of the purchase and assumption transaction shall be combined with the insured shares reported on the acquiring federally insured credit union's quarterly Call Reports.

(c) *Expiration.* This section shall expire and no longer be applicable after December 31, 2022.
