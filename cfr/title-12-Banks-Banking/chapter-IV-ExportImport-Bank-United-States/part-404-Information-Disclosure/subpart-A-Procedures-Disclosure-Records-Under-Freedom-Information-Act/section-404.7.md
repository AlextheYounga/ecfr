(2) The records have been published or otherwise made available to the public; or

(3) disclosure of the records is required by law.

(d) *Opportunity to object to disclosure.* The business submitter shall have ten working days from and including the date of the notification letter to provide Ex-Im Bank with a detailed statement of any objection to disclosure of the records. A submitter located outside the United States shall have twenty working days to object to disclosure.

(h) *Notice to requester of disclosure date.* If Ex-Im Bank determines to disclose records over a business submitter's objection, then Ex-Im Bank shall notify the requester of the expected disclosure date.

(i) *Appeal.* Whenever Ex-Im Bank determines to disclose, pursuant to an administrative appeal, business information that initially was withheld from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), Ex-Im Bank shall notify the business submitter.

It shall include a copy or description of the records at issue and a statement of Ex-Im Bank's reasons for disclosure.

(j) *Notice of FOIA lawsuit.* Ex-Im Bank shall promptly notify the submitter whenever a requester brings suit against Ex-Im Bank seeking to compel the release of business information covered by this section.
