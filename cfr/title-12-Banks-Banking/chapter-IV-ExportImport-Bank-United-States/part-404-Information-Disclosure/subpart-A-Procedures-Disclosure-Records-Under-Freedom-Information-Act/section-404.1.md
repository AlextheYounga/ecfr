##### ยง 404.1 General provisions. #####

(a) *Purpose.* This subpart establishes policy, procedures, requirements, and responsibilities for administration of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, at the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank).

(b) *Policy.* It is Ex-Im Bank's policy to honor all requests for the disclosure of its records, provided that disclosure would not adversely affect a legitimate public or private interest and would not impose an unreasonable burden on Ex-Im Bank. However, this subpart also recognizes that the soundness of many Ex-Im Bank programs depends upon the receipt of reliable commercial, technical, financial, and business information relating to applicants for Ex-Im Bank assistance and that receipt of such information depends on Ex-Im Bank's ability to hold such information in confidence. Consequently, except as provided by applicable law and this regulation, information provided to Ex-Im Bank in confidence will not be disclosed without the submitter's consent.

(c) *Scope.* All record requests made to Ex-Im Bank shall be processed under this subpart, except that information customarily furnished to the public in the regular course of the performance of official duties may continue to be furnished to the public without complying with this subpart. Requests made by individuals under the Privacy Act of 1974 which are processed under subpart B of this part also shall be processed under this subpart A.

(d) *Ex-Im Bank Internet site.* Ex-Im Bank maintains an Internet site at *http://www.exim.gov.* The site contains information on Ex-Im Bank functions, activities, programs, and transactions. Web site visitors have access to Board of Directors and Loan Committee meeting minutes, country information, and Ex-Im Bank press releases, among other information. Ex-Im Bank encourages all prospective FOIA requesters to visit the site prior to submission of a FOIA request.

(e) *Delegation.* Any action or determination in this subpart which is the responsibility of a specific Ex-Im Bank employee, may be delegated to a duly designated alternate.

(f) *Ex-Im Bank address.* The Export-Import Bank of the United States is located at 811 Vermont Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20571.
