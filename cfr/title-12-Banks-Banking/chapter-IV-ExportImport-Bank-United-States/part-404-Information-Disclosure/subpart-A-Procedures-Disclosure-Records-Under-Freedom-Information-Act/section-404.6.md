##### ยง 404.6 Release of records under the Freedom of Information Act. #####

(a) *Creation of records.* A reasonable request for material not in existence may be honored at Ex-Im Bank's discretion when tabulation or compilation will not significantly burden Ex-Im Bank, its programs or its activities.

(b) *Discretionary release.* Consistent with federal government policy, material technically qualifying for exemption from disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(5) may be made available when disclosure would not adversely affect legitimate public or private interests, violate law or impose an unreasonable burden on Ex-Im Bank. This policy does not, however, create any right enforceable in a court of law.

(c) *Segregable records.* Whenever it is determined that a portion of a record is exempt from disclosure, any reasonably segregable portion of the record shall be provided to the requester after redaction of the exempt material. If segregation would render the document meaningless, Ex-Im Bank shall withhold the entire record.

(d) *Date for determining responsive records.* Only those records within Ex-Im Bank's possession and control as of the date of receipt of a request shall be deemed to be responsive to a request.
