##### ยง 408.6 Typical classes of action. #####

(a) Section 1507.3(c)(2) of the NEPA Regulations in conjunction with ยง 1508.4 thereof requires agencies to establish three typical classes of action for similar treatment under NEPA. These typical classes of action are set forth below:

|Actions normally requiring EIS's|                                                        Actions normally requiring assessments but not necessarily EIS's                                                         |            Actions normally not requiring assessments or EIS's            |

(b) Eximbank will independently determine whether an EIS or an environmental assessment is required where:

(1) A proposal for agency action is not covered by one of the typical classes of action above; or

(2) For actions which are covered, the presence of extraordinary circumstances indicates that some other level of environmental review may be appropriate.
