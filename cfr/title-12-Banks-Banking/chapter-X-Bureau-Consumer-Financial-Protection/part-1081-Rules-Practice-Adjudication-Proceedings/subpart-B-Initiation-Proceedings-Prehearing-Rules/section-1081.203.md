##### § 1081.203 Scheduling conference. #####

(a) *Meeting of the parties before scheduling conference.* As early as practicable before the scheduling conference described in paragraph (b) of this section, counsel for the parties shall meet to discuss the nature and basis of their claims and defenses and the possibilities for a prompt settlement or resolution of the case. The parties shall also discuss and agree, if possible, on the matters set forth in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) *Scheduling conference.* Within 20 days of service of the notice of charges or such other time as the parties and hearing officer may agree, counsel for all parties shall appear before the hearing officer in person at a specified time and place or by telephone for the purpose of scheduling the course and conduct of the proceeding. This meeting or telephone conference is called a *scheduling conference.* At the scheduling conference, counsel for the parties shall be prepared to address:

(1) Determination of the dates and location of the hearing, including, in proceedings under section 1053(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, whether the hearing should commence later than 60 days after service of the notice of charges;

(2) Simplification and clarification of the issues;

(3) Amendments to pleadings;

(4) Settlement of any or all issues;

(5) Production of documents as set forth in § 1081.206 and of witness statements as set forth in § 1081.207, and prehearing production of documents in response to subpoenas *duces tecum* as set forth in § 1081.208;

(6) Whether or not the parties intend to move for summary disposition of any or all issues;

(7) Whether the parties intend to seek the deposition of witnesses pursuant to § 1081.209;

(8) A schedule for the exchange of expert reports and the taking of expert depositions, if any; and

(9) Such other matters as may aid in the orderly disposition of the proceeding.

(c) *Transcript.* The hearing officer, in his or her discretion, may require that a scheduling conference be recorded by a court reporter. A transcript of the conference and any materials filed, including orders, becomes part of the record of the proceeding. A party may obtain a copy of the transcript at his or her expense.

(d) *Scheduling order.* At or within five days following the conclusion of the scheduling conference, the hearing officer shall serve on each party an order setting forth the date and location of the hearing and any agreements reached and any procedural determinations made.

(e) *Failure to appear; default.* Any person who is named in a notice of charges as a person against whom findings may be made or sanctions imposed and who fails to appear, in person or through counsel, at a scheduling conference of which he or she has been duly notified may be deemed in default pursuant to § 1081.201(d)(1). A party may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to § 1081.201(d)(2).

(f) *Public access.* The scheduling conference shall be public unless the hearing officer determines, based on the standard set forth in § 1081.119(c), that the conference (or any part thereof) shall be closed to the public.
