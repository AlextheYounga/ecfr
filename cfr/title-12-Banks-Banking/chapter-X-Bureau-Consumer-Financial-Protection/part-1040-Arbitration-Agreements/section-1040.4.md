##### § 1040.4 Limitations on the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements. #####

(a) *Use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements in class actions* - (1) *General rule.* A provider shall not rely in any way on a pre-dispute arbitration agreement entered into after the date set forth in § 1040.5(a) with respect to any aspect of a class action that concerns any of the consumer financial products or services covered by § 1040.3, including to seek a stay or dismissal of particular claims or the entire action, unless and until the presiding court has ruled that the case may not proceed as a class action and, if that ruling may be subject to appellate review on an interlocutory basis, the time to seek such review has elapsed or such review has been resolved such that the case cannot proceed as a class action.

(2) *Provision required in covered pre-dispute arbitration agreements.* Upon entering into a pre-dispute arbitration agreement for a consumer financial product or service covered by § 1040.3 after the date set forth in § 1040.5(a):

(i) Except as provided elsewhere in this paragraph (a)(2) or in § 1040.5(b), a provider shall ensure that any such pre-dispute arbitration agreement contains the following provision: “We agree that neither we nor anyone else will rely on this agreement to stop you from being part of a class action case in court. You may file a class action in court or you may be a member of a class action filed by someone else.”

(ii) When the pre-dispute arbitration agreement applies to multiple products or services, only some of which are covered by § 1040.3, the provider may include the following alternative provision in place of the one required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section: “We are providing you with more than one product or service, only some of which are covered by the Arbitration Agreements Rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The following provision applies only to class action claims concerning the products or services covered by that Rule: We agree that neither we nor anyone else will rely on this agreement to stop you from being part of a class action case in court. You may file a class action in court or you may be a member of a class action filed by someone else.”

(iii) When the pre-dispute arbitration agreement existed previously between other parties and does not contain either the provision required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section or the alternative permitted by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section:

(A) The provider shall either ensure the pre-dispute arbitration agreement is amended to contain the provision specified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (a)(2)(ii) of this section or provide any consumer to whom the agreement applies with the following written notice: “We agree not to rely on any pre-dispute arbitration agreement to stop you from being part of a class action case in court. You may file a class action in court or you may be a member of a class action filed by someone else.” When the pre-dispute arbitration agreement applies to multiple products or services, only some of which are covered by § 1040.3, the provider may, in this written notice, include the following optional additional language: “This notice applies only to class action claims concerning the products or services covered by the Arbitration Agreements Rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.”

(B) The provider shall ensure the pre-dispute arbitration agreement is amended or provide the notice to consumers within 60 days of entering into the pre-dispute arbitration agreement.

(iv) A provider may add any one or more of the following sentences at the end of the disclosures required by paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section:

(A)(*1*) “This provision does not apply to parties that entered into this agreement before March 19, 2018.”

(*2*) “This provision does not apply to products or services first provided to you before March 19, 2018 that are subject to an arbitration agreement entered into before that date.”

(B) “This provision does not apply to persons that are excluded from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Arbitration Agreements Rule.”

(C) “This provision also applies to the delegation provision.” A provider using this sentence as part of the disclosure required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section in a pre-dispute arbitration agreement is not required to separately insert the disclosure required by paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section into a delegation provision that relates to such a pre-dispute arbitration agreement.

(v) In any provision or notice required by this paragraph (a)(2), if the provider uses a standard term in the rest of the agreement to describe the provider or the consumer, the provider may use that term instead of the term “we” or “you.”

(vi) In any provision or notice required by this paragraph (a)(2), if a person has a genuine belief that sovereign immunity from suit under applicable law may apply to any person that may seek to assert the pre-dispute arbitration agreement, then the provision or notice may include, after the sentence reading “You may file a class action in court or you may be a member of a class action filed by someone else,” the following language: “However, the defendants in the class action may claim they cannot be sued due to their sovereign immunity. This provision does not create or waive any such immunity.” In the preceding sentence, the word “notice” may be substituted for the word “provision” when the included language is in a notice.

(vii) A provider may provide any provision or notice required by this paragraph (a)(2) in a language other than English if the pre-dispute arbitration agreement also is written in that other language.

(b) *Submission of arbitral and court records.* For any pre-dispute arbitration agreement for a consumer financial product or service covered by § 1040.3 entered into after the date set forth in § 1040.5(a), a provider shall comply with the requirements set forth below.
