##### ยง 1070.15 Responsibility for responding to requests for CFPB records. #####

(a) *In general.* In determining which records are responsive to a request, the CFPB ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date the CFPB begins its search for them. If any other date is used, the CFPB shall inform the requester of that date.

(b) *Authority to grant or deny requests.* The Chief FOIA Officer shall be authorized to grant or deny any request for a record of the CFPB.

(c) *Consultations and referrals.* (1) When a requested record has been created by an agency other than the CFPB, the CFPB shall refer the record to the originating agency for a direct response to the requester.

(2) When a FOIA request is received for a record created by the CFPB that includes information originated by another agency, the CFPB shall consult the originating agency for review and recommendation on disclosure. The CFPB shall not release any such records without prior consultation with the originating agency.

(d) *Notice of referral.* Whenever the CFPB refers all or any part of the responsibility for responding to a request to another agency, it will notify the requester of the referral and inform the requester of the name of each agency to which the request has been referred, in whole or in part.
