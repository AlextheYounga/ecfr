(a) *Data format and itemization.* A financial institution shall collect data regarding applications for, and originations and purchases of, home purchase loans, home improvement loans, and refinancings for each calendar year. An institution is required to collect data regarding requests under a preapproval program (as defined in § 1003.2) only if the preapproval request is denied or results in the origination of a home purchase loan. All reportable transactions shall be recorded, within thirty calendar days after the end of the calendar quarter in which final action is taken (such as origination or purchase of a loan, or denial or withdrawal of an application), on a register in the format prescribed in appendix A of this part. The data recorded shall include the following items:

(1) An identifying number for the loan or loan application, and the date the application was received.

(2) The type of loan or application.

(3) The purpose of the loan or application.

(4) Whether the application is a request for preapproval and whether it resulted in a denial or in an origination.

(5) The property type to which the loan or application relates.

(6) The owner-occupancy status of the property to which the loan or application relates.

(7) The amount of the loan or the amount applied for.

(8) The type of action taken, and the date.

(9) The location of the property to which the loan or application relates, by MSA or by Metropolitan Division, by state, by county, and by census tract, if the institution has a home or branch office in that MSA or Metropolitan Division.

(10) The ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant or borrower, and the gross annual income relied on in processing the application.

(11) The type of entity purchasing a loan that the institution originates or purchases and then sells within the same calendar year (this information need not be included in quarterly updates).

(12)(i) For originated loans subject to Regulation Z, 12 CFR part 1026, the difference between the loan's annual percentage rate (APR) and the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set, if that difference is equal to or greater than 1.5 percentage points for loans secured by a first lien on a dwelling, or equal to or greater than 3.5 percentage points for loans secured by a subordinate lien on a dwelling.

(ii) “Average prime offer rate” means an annual percentage rate that is derived from average interest rates, points, and other loan pricing terms currently offered to consumers by a representative sample of creditors for mortgage loans that have low-risk pricing characteristics. The Bureau publishes average prime offer rates for a broad range of types of transactions in tables updated at least weekly, as well as the methodology the Bureau uses to derive these rates.

(13) Whether the loan is subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994, as implemented in Regulation Z (12 CFR 1026.32).

(14) The lien status of the loan or application (first lien, subordinate lien, or not secured by a lien on a dwelling).

(b) *Collection of data on ethnicity, race, sex, and income.* (1) A financial institution shall collect data about the ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant or borrower as prescribed in appendix B of this part.

(2) Ethnicity, race, sex, and income data may but need not be collected for loans purchased by the financial institution.

(c) *Optional data.* A financial institution may report:

(1) The reasons it denied a loan application;

(2) Requests for preapproval that are approved by the institution but not accepted by the applicant; and

(3) Home-equity lines of credit made in whole or in part for the purpose of home improvement or home purchase.

(d) *Excluded data.* A financial institution shall not report:

(1) Loans originated or purchased by the financial institution acting in a fiduciary capacity (such as trustee);

(2) Loans on unimproved land;

(3) Temporary financing (such as bridge or construction loans);

(4) The purchase of an interest in a pool of loans (such as mortgage-participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities, or real estate mortgage investment conduits);

(5) The purchase solely of the right to service loans; or

(6) Loans acquired as part of a merger or acquisition, or as part of the acquisition of all of the assets and liabilities of a branch office as defined in § 1003.2.

(e) *Data reporting for banks and savings associations that are required to report data on small business, small farm, and community development lending under CRA.* Banks and savings associations that are required to report data on small business, small farm, and community development lending under regulations that implement the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901 *et seq.*) shall also collect the location of property located outside MSAs and Metropolitan Divisions in which the institution has a home or branch office, or outside any MSA.
