Compliance is enforced by the agencies listed in section 305 of the Act (12 U.S.C. 2804).

(2) An incorrect entry for a census tract number is deemed a *bona fide* error, and is not a violation of the act or this part, provided that the institution maintains procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.

(3) If an institution makes a good-faith effort to record all data concerning covered transactions fully and accurately within thirty calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter, and some data are nevertheless inaccurate or incomplete, the error or omission is not a violation of the act or this part provided that the institution corrects or completes the information prior to submitting the loan/application register to its regulatory agency.
