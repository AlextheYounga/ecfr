##### ยง 1006.9 Debt collection practices in connection with the global COVID-19 pandemic. #####

(a) *Purpose and coverage.* The purpose of this subpart is to eliminate certain abusive debt collection practices by debt collectors related to the global COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure that debt collectors who refrain from using such abusive debt collection practices are not competitively disadvantaged, and to promote consistent State action to protect consumers against such debt collection abuses. This subpart applies to debt collectors, as defined in FDCPA section 803(6), 15 U.S.C. 1692(a)(6), other than a person excluded from coverage by section 1029(a) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010, title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, 12 U.S.C. 5519(a).

(b) *Definitions.* For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:

(1) The terms *consumer, debt,* and *debt collector* have the same meaning given to them in FDCPA section 803, 15 U.S.C. 1692a.

(2) The term *CDC Order* means the order issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention titled *Temporary Halt in Residential Evictions to Prevent the Further Spread of COVID-19* (86 FR 16731 (Mar. 31, 2021)), as extended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

(3) The term *eviction notice* means the earliest of any written notice that the laws of any State, locality, territory, or tribal area require to be provided to a consumer before an eviction action against the consumer may be filed.

(c) *Prohibitions.* During the effective period of the CDC Order, a debt collector collecting a debt in any jurisdiction in which the CDC Order applies must not, in connection with the collection of that debt:

(1) File an eviction action for non-payment of rent against a consumer to whom the CDC Order reasonably might apply without disclosing to that consumer clearly and conspicuously in writing, on the date that the debt collector provides the consumer with an eviction notice or, if no eviction notice is required by applicable law, on the date that the eviction action is filed, that the consumer may be eligible for temporary protection from eviction under the CDC Order; or

(2) Falsely represent or imply to a consumer that the consumer is ineligible for temporary protection from eviction under the CDC Order.
