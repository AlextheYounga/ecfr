##### § 329.30 Total net cash outflow amount. #####

(a) *Calculation of total net cash outflow amount.* As of the calculation date, a FDIC-supervised institution's total net cash outflow amount equals:

(ii) 75 percent of the amount calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section; *plus*

(3) The maturity mismatch add-on as calculated under paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) *Calculation of maturity mismatch add-on.* (1) For purposes of this section:

(ii) The net day 30 cumulative maturity outflow amount is equal to, as of the 30th day following the calculation date, the sum of the outflow amounts for instruments or transactions identified in § 329.32(g), (h)(1), (h)(2), (h)(5), (j), (k), and (l) that have a maturity date 30 calendar days or less from the calculation date *minus* the sum of the inflow amounts for instruments or transactions identified in § 329.33(c), (d), (e), and (f) that have a maturity date 30 calendar days or less from the calculation date.

(2) As of the calculation date, a FDIC-supervised institution's maturity mismatch add-on is equal to:

(i) The greater of:

(A) 0; and

(B) The largest net cumulative maturity outflow amount as calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section for any of the 30 calendar days following the calculation date; *minus*

(ii) The greater of:

(A) 0; and

(B) The net day 30 cumulative maturity outflow amount as calculated under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.

(3) Other than the transactions identified in § 329.32(h)(2), (h)(5), or (j) or § 329.33(d) or (f), the maturity of which is determined under § 329.31(a), transactions that have no maturity date are not included in the calculation of the maturity mismatch add-on.
