(B) 4 percent if the requirements of § 324.35(b)(3)(A) are not met.

(ii) A clearing member FDIC-supervised institution must calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for any collateral provided to a CCP, clearing member, or a custodian in connection with a cleared transaction in accordance with requirements under § 324.32.

(d) *Default fund contributions* - (1) *General requirement.* A clearing member FDIC-supervised institution must determine the risk-weighted asset amount for a default fund contribution to a CCP at least quarterly, or more frequently if, in the opinion of the FDIC-supervised institution or the FDIC, there is a material change in the financial condition of the CCP.

(2) *Risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to non-qualifying CCPs.* A clearing member FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to CCPs that are not QCCPs equals the sum of such default fund contributions multiplied by 1,250 percent, or an amount determined by the FDIC, based on factors such as size, structure and membership characteristics of the CCP and riskiness of its transactions, in cases where such default fund contributions may be unlimited.

(3) *Risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to QCCP*s. A clearing member FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for default fund contributions to QCCPs equals the sum of its capital requirement, KCM for each QCCP, as calculated under the methodology set forth in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section (Method 1), multiplied by 1,250 percent or in paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section (Method 2).

(i) *Method 1.* The hypothetical capital requirement of a QCCP (KCCP) equals:

![](/graphics/er10se13.015.gif)Where(A) EBRMi equals the exposure amount for each transaction cleared through the QCCP by clearing member i, calculated in accordance with § 324.34 for OTC derivative contracts and § 324.37(c)(2) for repo-style transactions, provided that:(*1*) For purposes of this section, in calculating the exposure amount the FDIC-supervised institution may replace the formula provided in § 324.34(a)(2)(ii) with the following: Anet = (0.15 × Agross) + (0.85 × NGR × Agross); and(*2*) For option derivative contracts that are cleared transactions, the PFE described in § 324.34(a)(1)(ii) must be adjusted by multiplying the notional principal amount of the derivative contract by the appropriate conversion factor in Table 1 to § 324.34 and the absolute value of the option's delta, that is, the ratio of the change in the value of the derivative contract to the corresponding change in the price of the underlying asset.(*3*) For repo-style transactions, when applying § 324.37(c)(2), the FDIC-supervised institution must use the methodology in § 324.37(c)(3);(B) VMi equals any collateral posted by clearing member i to the QCCP that it is entitled to receive from the QCCP, but has not yet received, and any collateral that the QCCP has actually received from clearing member i;(C) IMi equals the collateral posted as initial margin by clearing member i to the QCCP;(D) DFi equals the funded portion of clearing member i's default fund contribution that will be applied to reduce the QCCP's loss upon a default by clearing member i;(E) RW equals 20 percent, except when the FDIC has determined that a higher risk weight is more appropriate based on the specific characteristics of the QCCP and its clearing members; and(F) Where a QCCP has provided its KCCP, an FDIC-supervised institution must rely on such disclosed figure instead of calculating KCCP under this paragraph (d), unless the FDIC-supervised institution determines that a more conservative figure is appropriate based on the nature, structure, or characteristics of the QCCP.

(ii) For an FDIC-supervised institution that is a clearing member of a QCCP with a default fund supported by funded commitments, KCM equals:

![](/graphics/er10se13.016.gif)

(A) Subscripts 1 and 2 denote the clearing members with the two largest ANet values. For purposes of this paragraph (d), for derivatives ANet is defined in § 324.34(a)(2)(ii) and for repo-style transactions, ANet means the exposure amount as defined in § 324.37(c)(2) using the methodology in § 324.37(c)(3);

(B) N equals the number of clearing members in the QCCP;

(C) DFCCP equals the QCCP's own funds and other financial resources that would be used to cover its losses before clearing members' default fund contributions are used to cover losses;

(D) DFCM equals funded default fund contributions from all clearing members and any other clearing member contributed financial resources that are available to absorb mutualized QCCP losses;

(E) DF = DFCCP + DFCM (that is, the total funded default fund contribution);

![](/graphics/er10se13.017.gif)Where(*1*) DFi equals the FDIC-supervised institution's unfunded commitment to the default fund;(*2*) DFCM equals the total of all clearing members' unfunded commitment to the default fund; and(*3*) *K\**CM as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.

(B) For an FDIC-supervised institution that is a clearing member of a QCCP with a default fund supported by unfunded commitments and is unable to calculate KCM using the methodology described in paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this section, KCM equals:

![](/graphics/er10se13.018.gif)Where(*1*) IMi = the FDIC-supervised institution's initial margin posted to the QCCP;(*2*) IMCM equals the total of initial margin posted to the QCCP; and(*3*) *K\**CM as defined in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.

(iv) *Method 2.* A clearing member FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted asset amount for its default fund contribution to a QCCP, RWADF, equals:

RWADF = Min {12.5 \* DF; 0.18 \* TE}Where(A) TE equals the FDIC-supervised institution's trade exposure amount to the QCCP, calculated according to § 324.35(c)(2);(B) DF equals the funded portion of the FDIC-supervised institution's default fund contribution to the QCCP.

(4) *Total risk-weighted assets for default fund contributions.* Total risk-weighted assets for default fund contributions is the sum of a clearing member FDIC-supervised institution's risk-weighted assets for all of its default fund contributions to all CCPs of which the FDIC-supervised institution is a clearing member.
