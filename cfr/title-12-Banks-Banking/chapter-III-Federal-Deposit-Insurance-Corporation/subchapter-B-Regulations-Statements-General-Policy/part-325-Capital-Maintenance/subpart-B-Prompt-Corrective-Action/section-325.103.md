(d) *Reclassifications based on supervisory criteria other than capital.* The FDIC may reclassify a well capitalized bank as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized bank or an undercapitalized bank to comply with certain mandatory or discretionary supervisory actions as if the bank were in the next lower capital category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized bank as critically undercapitalized) (each of these actions are hereinafter referred to generally as “reclassifications”) in the following circumstances:

(1) *Unsafe or unsound condition.* The FDIC has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to § 308.202(a) of this chapter, that the bank is in unsafe or unsound condition; or
