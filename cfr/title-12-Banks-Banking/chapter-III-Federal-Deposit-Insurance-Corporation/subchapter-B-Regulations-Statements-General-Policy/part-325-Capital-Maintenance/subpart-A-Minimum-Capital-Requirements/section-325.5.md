##### § 325.5 Miscellaneous. #####

(a) *Intangible assets.* Any intangible assets that were explicitly approved by the FDIC as part of the bank's regulatory capital on a specific case basis will be included in capital under the terms and conditions that were approved by the FDIC, provided that the intangible asset is being amortized over a period not to exceed 15 years or its estimated useful life, whichever is shorter. However, pursuant to section 18(n) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(n)), an unidentifiable intangible asset such as goodwill, if acquired after April 12, 1989, cannot be included in calculating regulatory capital under this part.

(b) *Reservation of authority.* Notwithstanding the definition of *Tier 1 capital* in § 325.2(t) of this subpart and the risk-based capital definitions of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital in appendix A to this subpart, the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) may, if the Director finds a newly developed or modified capital instrument or a particular balance sheet entry or account to be the functional equivalent of a component of Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital, permit one or more insured depository institutions to include all or a portion of such instrument, entry, or account as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital, permanently, or on a temporary basis, for purposes of this part. Similarly, the Director of the Division of Supervision and Consumer Protection (DSC) may, if the Director finds that a particular Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital component or balance sheet entry or account has characteristics or terms that diminish its contribution to an insured depository institution's ability to absorb losses, require the deduction of all or a portion of such component, entry, or account from Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.

(c) *Securities subsidiary.* For purposes of this part, any securities subsidiary subject to 12 CFR 337.4 shall not be consolidated with its bank parent and any investment therein shall be deducted from the bank parent's Tier 1 capital and total assets.

(d) *Depository institution subsidiary.* Any domestic depository institution subsidiary that is not consolidated in the “Reports of Condition and Income” (Call Report) of its insured parent bank shall be consolidated with the insured parent bank for purposes of this part. The financial statements of the subsidiary that are to be used for this consolidation must be prepared in the same manner as the “Reports of Condition and Income” (Call Report). A domestic depository institution subsidiary of a savings association shall be consolidated for purposes of this part if such consolidation also is required pursuant to the capital requirements of the association's primary federal regulator.

(e) *Restrictions relating to capital components.* To qualify as Tier 1 capital under this part or Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital under appendix A to this part, a capital instrument must not contain or be subject to any conditions, covenants, terms, restrictions, or provisions that are inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices. A condition, covenant, term, restriction, or provision is inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices if it:

(1) Unduly interferes with the ability of the issuer to conduct normal banking operations;

(2) Results in significantly higher dividends or interest payments in the event of deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer;

(3) Impairs the ability of the issuer to comply with statutory or regulatory requirements regarding the disposition of assets or incurrence of additional debt; or

(4) Limits the ability of the FDIC or a similar regulatory authority to take any necessary action to resolve a problem bank or failing bank situation.

Other conditions and covenants that are not expressly listed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(4) of this section also may be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.

(f) *Treatment of mortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, nonmortgage servicing assets, and credit-enhancing interest-only strips.* For purposes of determining Tier 1 capital under this part, mortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, nonmortgage servicing assets, and credit-enhancing interest-only strips will be deducted from assets and from common stockholders' equity to the extent that these items do not meet the conditions, limitations, and restrictions described in this section. Banks may elect to deduct disallowed servicing assets and disallowed credit-enhancing interest-only strips on a basis that is net of a proportional amount of any associated deferred tax liability recorded on the balance sheet. Any deferred tax liability netted in this manner cannot also be netted against deferred tax assets when determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income and calculating the maximum allowable amount of these assets under paragraph (g) of this section.

(1) *Valuation.* The fair value of mortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, nonmortgage servicing assets, and credit-enhancing interest-only strips shall be estimated at least quarterly. The quarterly fair value estimate shall include adjustments for any significant changes in the original valuation assumptions, including changes in prepayment estimates or attrition rates. The FDIC in its discretion may require independent fair value estimates on a case-by-case basis where it is deemed appropriate for safety and soundness purposes.

(2) *Fair value limitation.* For purposes of calculating Tier 1 capital under this part (but not for financial statement purposes), the balance sheet assets for mortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, and nonmortgage servicing assets will each be reduced to an amount equal to the lesser of:

(i) 90 percent of the fair value of these assets, determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section; or

(ii) 100 percent of the remaining unamortized book value of these assets (net of any related valuation allowances), determined in accordance with the instructions for the preparation of the “Reports of Income and Condition” (Call Reports).

(3) *Tier 1 capital limitations.* (i) The maximum allowable amount of mortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, and nonmortgage servicing assets in the aggregate will be limited to the lesser of:

(A) 100 percent of the amount of Tier 1 capital that exists before the deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card relationships, any disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed credit-enhancing interest-only strips, any disallowed deferred tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity investments; or

(B) The sum of the amounts of mortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, and nonmortgage servicing assets, determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

(ii) The maximum allowable amount of credit-enhancing interest-only strips, whether purchased or retained, will be limited to the lesser of:

(A) 25 percent of the amount of Tier 1 capital that exists before the deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card relationships, any disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed credit-enhancing interest-only strips, any disallowed deferred tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity investments; or

(B) The sum of the face amounts of all credit-enhancing interest-only strips.

(4) *Tier 1 capital sublimit.* In addition to the aggregate limitation on mortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, and nonmortgage servicing assets set forth in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, a sublimit will apply to purchased credit card relationships and nonmortgage servicing assets. The maximum allowable amount of the aggregate of purchased credit card relationships and nonmortgage servicing assets will be limited to the lesser of:

(i) 25 percent of the amount of Tier 1 capital that exists before the deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card relationships, any disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed credit-enhancing interest-only strips, any disallowed deferred tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity investments; or

(ii) The sum of the amounts of purchased credit card relationships and nonmortgage servicing assets determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

(g) *Treatment of deferred tax assets.* For purposes of calculating Tier 1 capital under this part (but not for financial statement purposes), deferred tax assets are subject to the conditions, limitations, and restrictions described in this section.

(1) *Deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income.* These assets are:

(i) Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences that exceed the amount of taxes previously paid that could be recovered through loss carrybacks if existing temporary differences (both deductible and taxable and regardless of where the related deferred tax effects are reported on the balance sheet) fully reverse at the calendar quarter-end date; and

(ii) Deferred tax assets arising from operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.

(2) *Tier 1 capital limitations.* (i) The maximum allowable amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, will be limited to the lesser of:

(A) The amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income that is expected to be realized within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on projected future taxable income for that year; or

(B) 10 percent of the amount of Tier 1 capital that exists before the deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card relationships, any disallowed credit-enhancing interest-only strips, any disallowed deferred tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity investments.

(ii) For purposes of this limitation, all existing temporary differences should be assumed to fully reverse at the calendar quarter-end date. The recorded amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income, net of any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, in excess of this limitation will be deducted from assets and from equity capital for purposes of determining Tier 1 capital under this part. The amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carryback years and from the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences generally would not be deducted from assets and from equity capital. However, notwithstanding the first three sentences in this paragraph, the amount of carryback potential that may be considered in calculating the amount of deferred tax assets that a member of a consolidated group (for tax purposes) may include in Tier 1 capital may not exceed the amount which the member could reasonably expect to have refunded by its parent.

(3) *Projected future taxable income.* Projected future taxable income should not include net operating loss carryforwards to be used within one year of the most recent calendar quarter-end date or the amount of existing temporary differences expected to reverse within that year. Projected future taxable income should include the estimated effect of tax planning strategies that are expected to be implemented to realize tax carryforwards that will otherwise expire during that year. Future taxable income projections for the current fiscal year (adjusted for any significant changes that have occurred or are expected to occur) may be used when applying the capital limit at an interim calendar quarter-end date rather then preparing a new projection each quarter.

(4) *Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities.* The deferred tax effects of any unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities may be excluded from the determination of the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income and the calculation of the maximum allowable amount of such assets. If these deferred tax effects are excluded, this treatment must be followed consistently over time.

(5) *Goodwill and other intangible assets.* This paragraph (g)(5) provides the capital treatment for intangible assets acquired in a nontaxable business combination, and goodwill acquired in a taxable business combination.

(i) *Intangible assets acquired in nontaxable purchase business combinations.* A deferred tax liability that is specifically related to an intangible asset (other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships) acquired in a nontaxable purchase business combination may be netted against this intangible asset. Only the net amount of this intangible asset must be deducted from Tier 1 capital.

(ii) *Goodwill acquired in a taxable purchase business combination.* A deferred tax liability that is specifically related to goodwill acquired in a taxable purchase business combination may be netted against this goodwill. Only the net amount of this goodwill must be deducted from Tier 1 capital.

(iii) *Treatment of a netted deferred tax liability.* When a deferred tax liability is netted in accordance with paragraph (g)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section, the taxable temporary difference that gives rise to this deferred tax liability must be excluded from existing taxable temporary differences when determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income and calculating the maximum allowable amount of such assets.

(iv) *Valuation.* The FDIC in its discretion may require independent fair value estimates for goodwill and other intangible assets on a case-by-case basis where it is deemed appropriate for safety and soundness purposes.
