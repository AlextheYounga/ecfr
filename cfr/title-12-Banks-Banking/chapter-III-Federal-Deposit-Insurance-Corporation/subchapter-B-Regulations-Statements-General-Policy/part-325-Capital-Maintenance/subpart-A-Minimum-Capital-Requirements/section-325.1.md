##### ยง 325.1 Scope. #####

The provisions of this subpart A apply to those circumstances for which the Federal Deposit Insurance Act or this chapter requires an evaluation of the adequacy of an insured depository institution's capital structure. The FDIC is required to evaluate capital before approving various applications by insured depository institutions. The FDIC also must evaluate capital, as an essential component, in determining the safety and soundness of state nonmember banks it insures and supervises and in determining whether depository institutions are in an unsafe or unsound condition. This subpart A establishes the criteria and standards the FDIC will use in calculating the minimum leverage capital requirement and in determining capital adequacy. In addition, appendix A to this subpart sets forth the FDIC's risk-based capital policy statement and appendix B to this subpart includes a statement of policy on capital adequacy that provides interpretational guidance as to how this subpart will be administered and enforced. In accordance with subpart B of part 325, the FDIC also must evaluate an institution's capital for purposes of determining whether the institution is subject to the prompt corrective action provisions set forth in section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o).
