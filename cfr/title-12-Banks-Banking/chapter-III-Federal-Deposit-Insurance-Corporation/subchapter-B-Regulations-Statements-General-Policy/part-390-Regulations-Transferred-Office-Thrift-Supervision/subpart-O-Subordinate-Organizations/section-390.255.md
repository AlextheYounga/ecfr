##### § 390.255 How may a State savings association exercise its salvage power in connection with a service corporation or lower-tier entities? #####

(a) In accordance with this section, a State savings association (“you”) may exercise your salvage power to make a contribution or a loan (including a guarantee of a loan made by any other person) to a lower-tier entity (“salvage investment”) that exceeds the maximum amount otherwise permitted under law or regulation. You must notify the FDIC at least 30 days before making such a salvage investment. This notice must demonstrate that:

(1) The salvage investment protects your interest in the lower-tier entity;

(2) The salvage investment is consistent with safety and soundness; and

(3) You considered alternatives to the salvage investment and determined that such alternatives would not adequately satisfy paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.

(b) If the FDIC notifies you within 30 days that the Notice presents supervisory concerns, or raises significant issues of law or policy, you must apply for and receive the FDIC's prior written approval before making a salvage investment.

(c) If your lower-tier entity is a GAAP-consolidated subsidiary, your salvage investment under this section will be considered an investment in a subsidiary for purposes of subpart Z.
