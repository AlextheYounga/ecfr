##### § 390.254 How may a subsidiary of a State savings association issue securities? #####

(a) A subsidiary may issue, either directly or through a third party intermediary, any securities that its parent State savings association (“you”) may issue. The subsidiary must not state or imply that the securities it issues are covered by federal deposit insurance. A subsidiary may not issue any security the payment, maturity, or redemption of which may be accelerated upon the condition that you are insolvent or have been placed into receivership.

(b) You must file a notice with the FDIC in accordance with § 390.253 at least 30 days before your first issuance of any securities through an existing subsidiary or in conjunction with establishing or acquiring a new subsidiary. If the FDIC notifies you within 30 days that the notice presents supervisory concerns or raises significant issues of law or policy, you must receive the FDIC's prior written approval before issuing securities through your subsidiary.

(c) For as long as any securities are outstanding, you must maintain all records generated through each securities issuance in the ordinary course of business, including a copy of any prospectus, offering circular, or similar document concerning such issuance, and make such records available for examination by the FDIC. Such records must include, but are not limited to:

(1) The amount of your assets or liabilities (including any guarantees you make with respect to the securities issuance) that have been transferred or made available to the subsidiary; the percentage that such amount represents of the current book value of your assets on an unconsolidated basis; and the current book value of all such assets of the subsidiary;

(2) The terms of any guarantee(s) issued by you or any third party;

(3) A description of the securities the subsidiary issued;

(4) The net proceeds from the issuance of securities (or the pro rata portion of the net proceeds from securities issued through a jointly owned subsidiary); the gross proceeds of the securities issuance; and the market value of assets collateralizing the securities issuance (any assets of the subsidiary, including any guarantees of its securities issuance you have made);

(5) The interest or dividend rates and yields, or the range thereof, and the frequency of payments on the subsidiary's securities;

(6) The minimum denomination of the subsidiary's securities; and

(7) Where the subsidiary marketed or intends to market the securities.
