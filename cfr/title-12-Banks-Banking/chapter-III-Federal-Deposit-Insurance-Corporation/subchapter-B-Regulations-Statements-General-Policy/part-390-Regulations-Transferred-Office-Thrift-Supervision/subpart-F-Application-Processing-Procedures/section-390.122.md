(a) The FDIC will grant a meeting request or conduct a meeting on its own initiative, if it finds that written submissions are insufficient to address facts or issues raised in an application, or otherwise determines that a meeting will benefit the decision-making process. The FDIC may limit the issues considered at the meeting to issues that the FDIC decides are relevant or material.

(b) The FDIC will inform the applicant and all commenters requesting a meeting of its decision to grant or deny a meeting request, or of its decision to conduct a meeting on its own initiative.

(c) If the FDIC decides to conduct a meeting, the FDIC will invite the applicant and any commenters requesting a meeting and raising an issue that FDIC intends to consider at the meeting. The FDIC may also invite other interested persons to attend. The FDIC will inform the participants of the date, time, location, issues to be considered, and format for the meeting a reasonable time before the meeting.
