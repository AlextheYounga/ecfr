##### § 390.100 What does this subpart do? #####

(a) This subpart explains the FDIC's procedures for processing applications, notices, or filings (applications) under parts 390 and 391 for State savings associations. Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, §§ 390.103 through 390.110 and §§ 390.126 through 390.135 apply whenever an FDIC regulation requires any person (you) to file an application with the FDIC. Sections 390.111 through 390.125, however, only apply when a FDIC regulation incorporates the procedures in those sections or where otherwise required by the FDIC.

(b) This subpart does not apply to any of the following:

(1) An application related to a transaction under section 13(c) or (k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1823(c) or (k).

(2) A request for reconsideration, modification, or appeal of a final FDIC action.

(3) A request related to litigation, an enforcement proceeding, a supervisory directive or supervisory agreement. Such requests include a request seeking approval under, modification of, or termination of an order issued under subparts C or D, a supervisory agreement, a supervisory directive, a consent merger agreement or a document negotiated in settlement of an enforcement matter or other litigation, unless an applicable FDIC regulation specifically requires an application under this subpart.

(4) An application filed under a FDIC regulation that prescribes other application processing procedures and time frames for the approval of applications.

(c) If a FDIC regulation for a specific type of application prescribes some application processing procedures, or time frames, the FDIC will apply this subpart to the extent necessary to process the application. For example, if a FDIC regulation for a specific type of application does not identify time periods for the processing of an application, the time periods in this subpart apply.
