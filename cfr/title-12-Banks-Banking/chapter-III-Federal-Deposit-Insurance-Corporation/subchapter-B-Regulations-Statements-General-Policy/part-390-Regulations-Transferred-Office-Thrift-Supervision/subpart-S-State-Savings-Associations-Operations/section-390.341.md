##### § 390.341 Inclusion of subordinated debt securities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock as supplementary capital. #####

(a) *Scope.* A State savings association must comply with this section in order to include subordinated debt securities or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (“covered securities”) in supplementary capital (tier 2 capital) under part 324 of this chapter. If a State savings association does not include covered securities in supplementary capital, it is not required to comply with this section.

(b) *Application and notice procedures.* (1) A State savings association must file an application or notice under §§ 390.103 through 390.110 seeking FDIC approval of, or non-objection to, the inclusion of covered securities in supplementary capital. The State savings association may file its application or notice before or after it issues covered securities, but may not include covered securities in supplementary capital until the FDIC approves the application or does not object to the notice.

(2) A State savings association must also comply with the securities offering rules at subpart W by filing an offering circular for a proposed issuance of covered securities, unless the offering qualifies for an exemption under that subpart.

(c) *Securities requirements.* To be included in supplementary capital, covered securities must meet the following requirements:

(1) *Form.* (i) Each certificate evidencing a covered security must:

(A) Bear the following legend on its face, in bold type: “This security is *not* a savings account or deposit and it is *not* insured by the United States or any agency or fund of the United States;”

(B) State that the security is subordinated on liquidation, as to principal, interest, and premium, to all claims against the State savings association that have the same priority as savings accounts or a higher priority;

(C) State that the security is not secured by the State savings association's assets or the assets of any affiliate of the State savings association. For purposes of this subpart, the term *affiliate* means any person or company which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such State savings association.

(D) State that the security is not eligible collateral for a loan by the State savings association;

(E) State the prohibition on the payment of dividends or interest at 12 U.S.C. 1828(b) and, in the case of subordinated debt securities, state the prohibition on the payment of principal and interest at 12 U.S.C. 1831o(h);

(F) For subordinated debt securities, state or refer to a document stating the terms under which the State savings association may prepay the obligation; and

(G) State or refer to a document stating that the State savings association must obtain FDIC approval before the voluntarily prepayment of principal on subordinated debt securities, the acceleration of payment of principal on subordinated debt securities, or the voluntarily redemption of mandatorily redeemable preferred stock (other than scheduled redemptions), if the State savings association is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized as described in subpart H of part 324 of this chapter, fails to meet the regulatory capital requirements in part 324, or would fail to meet any of these standards following the payment.

(ii) A State savings association must include such additional statements as the FDIC may prescribe for certificates, purchase agreements, indentures, and other related documents.

(2) *Maturity requirements.* Covered securities must have an original weighted average maturity or original weighted average period to required redemption of at least five years.

(3) *Mandatory prepayment.* Subordinated debt securities and related documents may not provide events of default or contain other provisions that could result in a mandatory prepayment of principal, other than events of default that:

(i) Arise from the State savings association's failure to make timely payment of interest or principal;

(ii) Arise from its failure to comply with reasonable financial, operating, and maintenance covenants of a type that are customarily included in indentures for publicly offered debt securities; or

(iii) Relate to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or similar events.

(4) *Indenture.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, a State savings association must use an indenture for subordinated debt securities. If the aggregate amount of subordinated debt securities publicly offered (excluding sales in a non-public offering as defined in § 390.413 and sold in any consecutive 12-month or 36-month period exceeds $5,000,000 or $10,000,000 respectively (or such lesser amount that the Securities and Exchange Commission shall establish by rule or regulation under 15 U.S.C. 77ddd), the indenture must provide for the appointment of a trustee other than the State savings association or an affiliate of the State savings association (as defined at § 390.283) and for collective enforcement of the security holders' rights and remedies.

(ii) A State savings association is not required to use an indenture if the subordinated debt securities are sold only to accredited investors, as that term is defined in 15 U.S.C. 77d(6). A State savings association must have an indenture that meets the requirements of paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section in place before any debt securities for which an exemption from the indenture requirement is claimed, are transferred to any non-accredited investor. If a State savings association relies on this exemption from the indenture requirement, it must place a legend on the debt securities indicating that an indenture must be in place before the debt securities are transferred to any non-accredited investor.

(d) *FDIC review.* (1) The FDIC will review notices and applications under §§ 390.126 through 390.135.

(2) In reviewing notices and applications under this section, the FDIC will consider whether:

(i) The issuance of the covered securities is authorized under applicable laws and regulations and is consistent with the State savings association's charter and bylaws.

(ii) The State savings association is at least adequately capitalized under subpart H of part 324 of this chapter and meets the regulatory capital requirements in part 324.

(iii) The State savings association is or will be able to service the covered securities.

(iv) The covered securities are consistent with the requirements of this section.

(v) The covered securities and related transactions sufficiently transfer risk from the Deposit Insurance Fund.

(vi) The FDIC has no objection to the issuance based on the State savings association's overall policies, condition, and operations.

(3) The FDIC approval or non-objection is conditioned upon no material changes to the information disclosed in the application or notice submitted to the FDIC. The FDIC may impose such additional requirements or conditions as it may deem necessary to protect purchasers, the State savings association, or the Deposit Insurance Fund.

(e) *Amendments.* If a State savings association amends the covered securities or related documents following the completion of the FDIC's review, it must obtain the FDIC's approval or non-objection under this section before it may include the amended securities in supplementary capital.

(f) *Sale of covered securities.* The State savings association must complete the sale of covered securities within one year after the FDIC's approval or non-objection under this section. A State savings association may request an extension of the offering period by filing a written request with the FDIC. The State savings association must demonstrate good cause for the extension and file the request at least 30 days before the expiration of the offering period or any extension of the offering period.

(g) *Reports.* A State savings association must file the following information with the FDIC within 30 days after the State savings association completes the sale of covered securities includable as supplementary capital. If the State savings association filed its application or notice following the completion of the sale, it must submit this information with its application or notice:

(1) A written report indicating the number of purchasers, the total dollar amount of securities sold, the net proceeds received by the State savings association from the issuance, and the amount of covered securities, net of all expenses, to be included as supplementary capital;

(2) Three copies of an executed form of the securities and a copy of any related documents governing the issuance or administration of the securities; and

(3) A certification by the appropriate executive officer indicating that the State savings association complied with all applicable laws and regulations in connection with the offering, issuance, and sale of the securities.
