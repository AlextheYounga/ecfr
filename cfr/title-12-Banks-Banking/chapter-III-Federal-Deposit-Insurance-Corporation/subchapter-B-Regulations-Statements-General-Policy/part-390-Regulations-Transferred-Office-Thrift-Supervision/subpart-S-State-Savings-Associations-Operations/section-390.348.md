##### § 390.348 Will the FDIC permit my capital distribution? #####

The FDIC will review your notice or application under the review procedures in §§ 390.126 through 390.135. The FDIC may disapprove your notice or deny your application filed under § 390.345 in whole or in part, if the FDIC makes any of the following determinations.

(a) You will be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized as set forth in § 390.453(b), following the capital distribution. If so, the FDIC will determine if your capital distribution is permitted under 12 U.S.C. 1831o(d)(1)(B).

(b) Your proposed capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns.

(c) Your proposed capital distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, agreement between you and the FDIC or a condition imposed on you in an FDIC-approved application or notice. If so, the FDIC will determine whether it may permit your capital distribution notwithstanding the prohibition or condition.
