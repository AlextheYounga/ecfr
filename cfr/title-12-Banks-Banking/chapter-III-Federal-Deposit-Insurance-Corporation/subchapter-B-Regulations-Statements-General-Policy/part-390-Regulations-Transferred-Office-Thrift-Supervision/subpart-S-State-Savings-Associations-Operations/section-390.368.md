##### § 390.368 When will the FDIC waive the prior notice requirement? #####

(a) *Waiver request.* (1) An individual may serve as a director or senior executive officer before filing a notice as described in §§ 390.360 through 390.368 if the FDIC issues a written finding that:

(i) Delay would threaten the safety or soundness of the State savings association;

(ii) Delay would not be in the public interest; or

(iii) Other extraordinary circumstances exist that justify waiver of prior notice.

(2) If the FDIC grants a waiver, you must file a notice as described in §§ 390.360-390.368 within the time period specified by the FDIC.

(b) *Automatic waiver.* An individual may serve as a director before filing a notice as described in §§ 390.360 through 390.368, if the individual was not nominated by management and the individual submits a notice as described in §§ 390.360 through 390.368 within seven days after election as a director.

(c) *Subsequent FDIC action.* The FDIC may disapprove a notice within 30 days after the FDIC issues a waiver under paragraph (a) of this section or within 30 days after the election of an individual who has filed a notice and is serving pursuant to an automatic waiver under paragraph (b) of this section.
