##### ยง 390.365 What procedures govern the FDIC's review of my notice for completeness? #####

The FDIC will first review your notice to determine whether it is complete.

(a) If your notice is complete, the FDIC will notify you in writing of the date that the FDIC received the complete notice.

(b) If your notice is not complete, the FDIC will notify you in writing what additional information you need to submit, why we need the information, and when you must submit it. You must, within the specified time period, provide additional information or request that the FDIC suspend processing of the notice. If you fail to act within the specified time period, the FDIC may treat the notice as withdrawn or may review the application based on the information provided.
