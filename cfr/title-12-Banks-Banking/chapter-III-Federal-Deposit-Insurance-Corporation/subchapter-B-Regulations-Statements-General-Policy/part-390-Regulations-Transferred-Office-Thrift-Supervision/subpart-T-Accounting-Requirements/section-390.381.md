(4) Computational note: For purposes of making the prescribed income test the following guidance should be applied:

(i) When a loss has been incurred by either the parent or its consolidated subsidiaries or the tested subsidiary, but not both, the equity in the income or loss of the tested subsidiary should be excluded from the income of the State savings association and its subsidiaries consolidated for purposes of the computation.

(ii) If income of the State savings association and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.
