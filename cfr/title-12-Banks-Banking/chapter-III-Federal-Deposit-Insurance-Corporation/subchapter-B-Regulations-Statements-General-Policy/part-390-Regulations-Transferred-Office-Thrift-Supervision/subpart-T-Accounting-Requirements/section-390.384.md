Condensed Financial Information

[Parent only]

[The State savings association may determine disclosure based on information provided in footnotes below]

(a) Provide condensed financial information as to financial position, changes in financial position, and results of operations of the State savings association as of the same dates and for the same periods for which audited consolidated financial statements are required. The financial information required need not be presented in greater detail than is required for condensed statement by 17 CFR 210.10-01(a) (2), (3), (4). Detailed footnote disclosure which would normally be included with complete financial statements may be omitted with the exception of disclosure regarding material contingencies, long-term obligations, and guarantees. Description of significant provisions of the state savings association's long-term obligations, mandatory dividend, or redemption requirements of redeemable stocks, and guarantees of the State savings association shall be provided along with a 5-year schedule of maturities of debt. If the material contingencies, long-term obligations, redeemable stock requirements, and guarantees of the State savings association have been separately disclosed in the consolidated statements, they need not be repeated in this schedule.

(b) Disclose separately the amount of cash dividends paid to the State savings association for each of the last three fiscal years by consolidated subsidiaries, unconsolidated subsidiaries, and 50-percent- or less-owned persons accounted for by the equity method, respectively.
