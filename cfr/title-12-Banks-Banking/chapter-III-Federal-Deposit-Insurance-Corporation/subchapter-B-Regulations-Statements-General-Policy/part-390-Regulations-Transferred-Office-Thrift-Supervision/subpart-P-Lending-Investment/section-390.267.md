##### ยง 390.267 Letters of credit and other independent undertakings to pay against documents. #####

(a) *General authority.* A State savings association may issue and commit to issue letters of credit within the scope of applicable laws or rules of practice recognized by law. It may also issue other independent undertakings within the scope of such laws or rules of practice recognized by law, that have been approved by the FDIC (approved undertaking).1 Under such letters of credit and approved undertakings, the State savings association's obligation to honor depends upon the presentation of specified documents and not upon nondocumentary conditions or resolution of questions of fact or law at issue between the account party and the beneficiary. A State savings association may also confirm or otherwise undertake to honor or purchase specified documents upon their presentation under another person's independent undertaking within the scope of such laws or rules.

1 Samples of laws or rules of practice applicable to letters of credit and other independent undertakings include, but are not limited to: the applicable version of Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) (1962, as amended 1990) or revised Article 5 of the UCC (as amended 1995) (available from West Publishing Co., 1/800/328-4880); the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) Publication No. 500) (available from ICC Publishing, Inc., 212/206-1150; the United Nations Convention on Independent Guarantees and Standby Letters of Credit (adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1995 and signed by the U.S. in 1997) (available from the U.N. Commission on International Trade Law, 212/963-5353); and the Uniform Rules for Bank-to-Bank Reimbursements Under Documentary Credits (ICC Publication No. 525) (available from ICC Publishing, Inc., 212/206-1150).

(b) *Safety and soundness considerations* - (1) *Terms.* As a matter of safe and sound banking practice, State savings associations that issue letters of credit or approved undertakings should not be exposed to undue risk. At a minimum, State savings associations should consider the following:

(i) The independent character of the letter of credit or approved undertaking should be apparent from its terms (such as terms that subject it to laws or rules providing for its independent character);

(ii) The letter of credit or approved undertaking should be limited in amount;

(iii) The letter of credit or approved undertaking should:

(A) Be limited in duration; or

(B) Permit the State savings association to terminate the letter of credit or approved undertaking, either on a periodic basis (consistent with the State savings association's ability to make any necessary credit assessments) or at will upon either notice or payment to the beneficiary; or

(C) Entitle the State savings association to cash collateral from the account party on demand (with a right to accelerate the customer's obligations, as appropriate); and

(iv) The State savings association either should be fully collateralized or have a post-honor right of reimbursement from its customer or from another issuer of a letter of credit or an independent undertaking. Alternatively, if the State savings association's undertaking is to purchase documents of title, securities, or other valuable documents, it should obtain a first priority right to realize on the documents if the State savings association is not otherwise to be reimbursed.

(2) *Additional considerations in special circumstances.* Certain letters of credit and approved undertakings require particular protections against credit, operational, and market risk:

(i) In the event that the undertaking is to honor by delivery of an item of value other than money, the State savings association should ensure that market fluctuations that affect the value of the item will not cause the State savings association to assume undue market risk;

(ii) In the event that the undertaking provides for automatic renewal, the terms for renewal should allow the State savings association to make any necessary credit assessment prior to renewal;

(iii) In the event that a State savings association issues an undertaking for its own account, the underlying transaction for which it is issued must be within the State savings association's authority and comply with any safety and soundness requirements applicable to that transaction.

(3) *Operational expertise.* The State savings association should possess operational expertise that is commensurate with the sophistication of its letter of credit or independent undertaking activities.

(4) *Documentation.* The State savings association must accurately reflect its letters of credit or approved undertakings in its records, including any acceptance or deferred payment or other absolute obligation arising out of its contingent undertaking.
