A State savings association shall appraise each parcel of real estate owned at the earlier of in-substance foreclosure or at the time of the State savings association's acquisition of such property, and at such times thereafter as dictated by prudent management policy; such appraisals shall be consistent with the requirements of subpart X of this part. The appropriate regional director or his or her designee may require subsequent appraisals if, in his or her discretion, such subsequent appraisal is necessary under the particular circumstances. The foregoing requirement shall not apply to any parcel of real estate that is sold and reacquired less than 12 months subsequent to the most recent appraisal made pursuant to this subpart. A dated, signed copy of each report of appraisal made pursuant to any provisions of this subpart shall be retained in the State savings association's records.
