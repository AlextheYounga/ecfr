##### § 390.321 Regulatory reports. #####

(a) *Definition and scope.* This section applies to all regulatory reports, as defined herein. A regulatory report is any report that the FDIC prepares, or is submitted to, or is used by the FDIC, to determine compliance with its rules and regulations, and to evaluate the safe and sound condition and operation of State savings associations. Regulatory reports are regulatory documents, not accounting documents.

(b) *Regulatory reporting requirements* - (1) *General.* The instructions to regulatory reports are referred to as “regulatory reporting requirements.” Regulatory reporting requirements include, but are not limited to, the accounting instructions, guidance contained in FDIC regulations, financial institution letters, manuals, bulletins, examination handbooks, and safe and sound practices. Regulatory reporting requirements are not limited to the minimum requirements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) because of the special supervisory, regulatory, and economic policy needs served by such reports. Regulatory reporting by State savings associations that purports to comply with GAAP shall incorporate the GAAP that best reflects the underlying economic substance of the transaction at issue. Regulatory reporting requirements shall, at a minimum:

(i) Incorporate GAAP whenever GAAP is the referenced accounting instruction for regulatory reports to the Federal banking agencies;

(ii) Incorporate safe and sound practices contained in FDIC regulations, financial institution letters, bulletins, examination handbooks, manuals, and instructions to regulatory reports; and

(iii) Incorporate additional safety and soundness requirements more stringent than GAAP, as the FDIC may prescribe.

(2) Exceptions. Regulatory reporting requirements that are not consistent with GAAP, if any, are not required to be reflected in the audited financial statements, including financial statements contained in securities filings submitted to the FDIC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or subpart W and 12 CFR part 192.

(3) *Compliance.* When the FDIC determines that a State savings association's regulatory reports did not conform to regulatory reporting requirements in previous reporting periods, the association shall correct its regulatory reports in accordance with the directions of the FDIC.
