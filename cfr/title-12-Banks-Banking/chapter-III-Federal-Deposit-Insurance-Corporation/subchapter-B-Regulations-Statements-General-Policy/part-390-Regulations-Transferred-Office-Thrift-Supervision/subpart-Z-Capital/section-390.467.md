##### ยง 390.467 Leverage ratio. #####

(a) The minimum leverage capital requirement for a State savings association assigned a composite rating of 1, as defined in this subpart, shall consist of a ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets of 3 percent. These generally are strong State savings associations that are not anticipating or experiencing significant growth and have well-diversified risks, including no undue interest rate risk exposure, excellent asset quality, high liquidity, and good earnings.

(b) For all State savings associations not meeting the conditions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, the minimum leverage capital requirement shall consist of a ratio of core capital to adjusted total assets of 4 percent. Higher capital ratios may be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of an individual State savings association. In all cases, State savings associations should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of all risks, including the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they are exposed.
