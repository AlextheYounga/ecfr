(b) *Purpose.* This subpart implements 12 U.S.C. 5365(i)(2), which requires the Corporation (in coordination with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Board”) and the Federal Insurance Office) to issue regulations that require each covered bank to conduct annual stress tests and establishes a definition of stress test, methodologies for conducting stress tests, and reporting and disclosure requirements.

(c) *Reservation of authority.* Notwithstanding any other provisions of this subpart, the Corporation may modify some or all of the requirements of this subpart.

(1) The Corporation may accelerate or extend any deadline for stress testing, reporting, or publication of the stress test results.

(2) The Corporation may require different or additional tests not otherwise required by this subpart or may require or permit different or additional analytical techniques and methodologies, different or additional scenarios (including components for the scenarios), or different assumptions for the covered bank to use in meeting the requirements of this subpart. In addition, the FDIC may specify a different as-of date for any or all categories of financial data used by the stress test.

(3) The Corporation may modify the reporting requirements of a report under this subpart or may require additional reports. The Corporation may modify the publication requirements of this subpart and or may require different or additional publication disclosures.

(5) Notice and comment procedures: In exercising its authority to require different or additional stress tests and different or additional scenarios (including components for the scenarios) under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Corporation will apply notice and response procedures in the same manner and to the same extent as the notice and response procedures in 12 CFR 324.5, as appropriate.
