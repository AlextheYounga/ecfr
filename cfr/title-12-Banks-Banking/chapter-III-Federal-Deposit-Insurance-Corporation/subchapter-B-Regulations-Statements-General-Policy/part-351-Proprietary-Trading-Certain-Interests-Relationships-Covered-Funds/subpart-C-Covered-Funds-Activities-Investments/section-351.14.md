(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a banking entity may:

(i) Acquire and retain any ownership interest in a covered fund in accordance with the requirements of § 351.11, § 351.12, or § 351.13 of this subpart; and

(ii) Enter into any prime brokerage transaction with any covered fund in which a covered fund managed, sponsored, or advised by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof) has taken an ownership interest, if:

(A) The banking entity is in compliance with each of the limitations set forth in § 351.11 of this subpart with respect to a covered fund organized and offered by such banking entity (or an affiliate thereof);

(B) The chief executive officer (or equivalent officer) of the banking entity certifies in writing annually to the FDIC (with a duty to update the certification if the information in the certification materially changes) that the banking entity does not, directly or indirectly, guarantee, assume, or otherwise insure the obligations or performance of the covered fund or of any covered fund in which such covered fund invests; and

(C) The Board has not determined that such transaction is inconsistent with the safe and sound operation and condition of the banking entity.

(b) *Restrictions on transactions with covered funds.* A banking entity that serves, directly or indirectly, as the investment manager, investment adviser, commodity trading advisor, or sponsor to a covered fund, or that organizes and offers a covered fund pursuant to § 351.11 of this subpart, or that continues to hold an ownership interest in accordance with § 351.11(b) of this subpart, shall be subject to section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-1), as if such banking entity were a member bank and such covered fund were an affiliate thereof.

(c) *Restrictions on prime brokerage transactions.* A prime brokerage transaction permitted under paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section shall be subject to section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c-1) as if the counterparty were an affiliate of the banking entity.
