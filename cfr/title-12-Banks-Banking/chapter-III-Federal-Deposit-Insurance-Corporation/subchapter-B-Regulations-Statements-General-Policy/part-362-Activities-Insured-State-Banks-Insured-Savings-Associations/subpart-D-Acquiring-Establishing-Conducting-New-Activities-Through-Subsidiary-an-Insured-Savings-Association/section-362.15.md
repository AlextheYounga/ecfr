No state or Federal insured savings association may establish or acquire a subsidiary, or conduct any new activity through a subsidiary, unless it files a notice in compliance with § 303.142(c) of this chapter at least 30 days prior to establishment of the subsidiary or commencement of the activity and the FDIC does not object to the notice. This requirement does not apply to any Federal savings bank that was chartered prior to October 15, 1982, as a savings bank under State law or any savings association that acquired its principal assets from such an institution.
