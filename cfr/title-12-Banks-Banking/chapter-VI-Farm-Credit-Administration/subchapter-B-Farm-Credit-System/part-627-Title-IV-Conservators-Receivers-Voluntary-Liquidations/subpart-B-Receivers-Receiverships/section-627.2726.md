Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 15083, Mar. 22, 2021.

(a) *Definitions.* For the purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

*Beneficial interest* means debt or equity (or mixed) interests or obligations of any type issued by a special purpose entity that entitle their holders to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow from financial assets owned by the special purpose entity.

*Financial asset* means cash or a contract or instrument that conveys to one entity a contractual right to receive cash or another financial instrument from another entity.

*Participation* means the transfer or assignment of an undivided interest in all or part of a loan or a lease from a seller, known as the “lead”, to a buyer, known as the “participant”, without recourse to the lead, pursuant to an agreement between the lead and the participant. *Without recourse* means that the participation is not subject to any agreement that requires the lead to repurchase the participant's interest or to otherwise compensate the participant due to a default on the underlying obligation.

*Securitization* means the issuance by a special purpose entity of beneficial interests:

(1) The most senior class of which at the time of issuance is rated in one of the four highest categories assigned to long-term debt or in an equivalent short-term category (within either of which there may be sub-categories or gradations indicating relative standing) by one or more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, or

(2) Which are sold in transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering for purposes of section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77d), as amended, or in transactions exempt from registration under such Act pursuant to Regulation S thereunder (or any successor regulation).

*Special purpose entity* means a trust, corporation, or other entity demonstrably distinct from the Farm Credit institution that is primarily engaged in acquiring and holding (or transferring to another special purpose entity) financial assets, and in activities related or incidental thereto, in connection with the issuance by such special purpose entity (or by another special purpose entity that acquires financial assets directly or indirectly from such special purpose entity) of beneficial interests.

(b) The receiver shall not, by exercise of its authority to repudiate contracts under § 627.2725(b)(2) and (b)(14), reclaim, recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the receivership any financial assets transferred by a Farm Credit institution in connection with a securitization or participation, provided that such transfer meets all conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles, other than the “legal isolation” condition as it applies to institutions for which the FCSIC may be appointed as receiver which is addressed by this section.

(c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply unless the Farm Credit institution received adequate consideration for the transfer of financial assets at the time of the transfer, and the documentation effecting the transfer of financial assets reflects the intent of the parties to treat the transaction as a sale, and not as a secured borrowing, for accounting purposes.

(d) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not be construed as waiving, limiting, or otherwise affecting the power of the receiver to disaffirm or repudiate any agreement imposing continuing obligations or duties upon the institution in receivership.

(e) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not be construed as waiving, limiting or otherwise affecting the rights or powers of the receiver to take any action or to exercise any power not specifically limited by this section, including, but not limited to, any rights, powers or remedies of the receiver regarding transfers taken in contemplation of the institution's insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the institution or the creditors of such institution, or that is a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.

(f) The receiver shall not seek to avoid an otherwise legally enforceable securitization agreement or participation agreement executed by a Farm Credit institution solely because such agreement does not meet the “contemporaneous” requirement of section 5.61(d) of the Act.

(g) This section may be repealed or amended by the Farm Credit Administration, but any such repeal or amendment shall not apply to any transfers of financial assets made in connection with a securitization or participation that was in effect before such repeal or modification.
