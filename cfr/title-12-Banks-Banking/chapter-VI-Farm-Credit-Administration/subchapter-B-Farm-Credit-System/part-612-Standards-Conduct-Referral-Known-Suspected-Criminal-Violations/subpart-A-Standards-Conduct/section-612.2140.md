(b) Divulge or make use of, except in the performance of official duties, any fact, information, or document not generally available to the public that is acquired by virtue of serving on the board of a System institution.

(c) Use the director's position to obtain or attempt to obtain special advantage or favoritism for the director, any relative of the director, any person residing in the director's household, any business partner of the director, any entity controlled by the director or such persons (alone or in concert), any other System institution, or any person transacting business with the institution, including borrowers and loan applicants.

(2) The transaction is undertaken in an official capacity in connection with the institution's discounting, lending, or participation relationships with OFIs and other lenders; or

(3) The Standards of Conduct Official determines, pursuant to policies and procedures adopted by the board, that the potential for conflict is insignificant because the transaction is in the ordinary course of business or is not material in amount and the director does not participate in the determination of any matter affecting the financial interests of the other party to the transaction except those matters affecting all shareholders/borrowers in a nondiscriminatory way.
