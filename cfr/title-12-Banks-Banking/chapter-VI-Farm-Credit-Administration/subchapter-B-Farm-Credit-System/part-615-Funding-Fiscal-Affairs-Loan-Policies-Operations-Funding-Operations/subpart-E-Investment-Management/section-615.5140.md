(b) *Rating of foreign countries.* Whenever the obligor or issuer of an eligible investment is located outside the United States, the host country must maintain the highest sovereign rating for political and economic stability by an NRSRO.

(c) *Marketable securities.* All eligible investments, except money market instruments, must be marketable. An eligible investment is marketable if you can sell it quickly at a price that closely reflects its fair value in an active and universally recognized secondary market.

(d) *Obligor limits.* (1) You may not invest more than 20 percent of your total capital in eligible investments issued by any single institution, issuer, or obligor. This obligor limit does not apply to obligations, including mortgage securities, that are issued or guaranteed as to interest and principal by the United States, its agencies, instrumentalities, or corporations.

(2) *Obligor limits for your holdings in an investment company.* You must count securities that you hold through an investment company towards the obligor limit of this section unless the investment company's holdings of the security of any one issuer do not exceed five (5) percent of the investment company's total portfolio.

(e) *Other investments approved by the FCA.* You may purchase and hold other investments that we approve. Your request for our approval must explain the risk characteristics of the investment and your purpose and objectives for making the investment.
