Otherwise counts toward limit for each type of investment.|

Note: You must also comply with requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and § 651.40 when applicable. “NA” means not applicable.

(b) *Rating of foreign countries.* Whenever the obligor or issuer of an eligible investment is located outside the United States, the host country must maintain the highest sovereign rating for political and economic stability by an NRSRO.

(c) *Marketable investments.* All eligible investments, except money market instruments, must be readily marketable. An eligible investment is marketable if you can sell it promptly at a price that closely reflects its fair value in an active and universally recognized secondary market. You must evaluate and document the size and liquidity of the secondary market for the investment at time of purchase.

(d) *Obligor limits.* (1) You may not invest more than 25 percent of your regulatory capital in eligible investments issued by any single entity, issuer, or obligor. This obligor limit does not apply to Government-sponsored agencies or Government agencies. You may not invest more than 100 percent of your regulatory capital in any one Government-sponsored agency. There are no obligor limits for Government agencies.

(2) *Obligor limits for your holdings in an investment company.* You must count securities that you hold through an investment company toward the obligor limits of this section unless the investment company's holdings of the security of any one issuer do not exceed 5 percent of the investment company's total portfolio.

(e) *Preferred stock and other investments approved by the FCA.* (1) You may purchase non-program investments in preferred stock issued by other Farm Credit System institutions only with our written prior approval.
