Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 4973, Feb. 20, 2019.

(a) *In general.* A System institution shall not make, increase, extend, or renew any designated loan unless the building or mobile home and any personal property securing the loan is covered by flood insurance for the term of the loan. The amount of insurance must be at least equal to the lesser of the outstanding principal balance of the designated loan or the maximum limit of coverage available for the particular type of property under the 1968 Act. Flood insurance coverage under the 1968 Act is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures a loan and not the land itself.

(b) *Table funded loans.* A System institution that acquires a loan from a mortgage broker or other entity through table funding shall be considered to be making a loan for the purposes of this subpart.
