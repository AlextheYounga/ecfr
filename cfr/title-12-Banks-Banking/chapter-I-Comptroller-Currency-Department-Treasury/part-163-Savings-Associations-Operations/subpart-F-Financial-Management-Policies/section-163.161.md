(a)(1) For the protection of depositors and other savings associations, each Federal savings association and each service corporation must be well managed and operate safely and soundly. Each also must pursue financial policies that are safe and consistent with economical home financing and the purposes of savings associations. In implementing this section, the OCC will consider that service corporations may be authorized to engage in activities that involve a higher degree of risk than activities permitted to savings associations.

(b) Compensation to officers, directors, and employees of each Federal savings association and its service corporations shall not be in excess of that which is reasonable and commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. Former officers, directors, and employees of savings association or its service corporation who regularly perform services therefore under consulting contracts are employees thereof for purposes of this paragraph (b).
