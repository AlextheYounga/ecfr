##### § 7.1015 National bank receipt of stock from a small business investment company. #####

A national bank may purchase the stock of a small business investment company (SBIC) (*see* 15 U.S.C. 682(b)), and may receive the benefits of such stock ownership (*e.g.,* stock dividends). The receipt and retention of a dividend by a national bank from an SBIC in the form of stock of a corporate borrower of the SBIC is not a purchase of stock within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh).
