##### § 7.1003 Money lent by a national bank at banking offices or at facilities other than banking offices. #####

(a) *General.* For purposes of what constitutes a branch within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j) and 12 CFR 5.30, “money” is deemed to be “lent” only at the place, if any, where the borrower in-person receives loan proceeds directly from bank funds:

(1) From the lending bank or its operating subsidiary; or

(2) At a facility that is established by the lending bank or its operating subsidiary.

(b) *Receipt of bank funds representing loan proceeds.* Loan proceeds directly from bank funds may be received by a borrower in person at a place that is not the bank's main office and is not licensed as a branch without violating 12 U.S.C. 36, 12 U.S.C. 81 and 12 CFR 5.30, provided that a third party is used to deliver the funds and the place is not established by the lending bank or its operating subsidiary. A third party includes a person who satisfies the requirements of § 7.1012(c)(2), or one who customarily delivers loan proceeds directly from bank funds under accepted industry practice, such as an attorney or escrow agent at a real estate closing.
