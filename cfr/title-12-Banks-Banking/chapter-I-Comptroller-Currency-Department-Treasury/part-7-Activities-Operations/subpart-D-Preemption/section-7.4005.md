##### § 7.4005 Combination of national bank loan production office, deposit production office, and remote service unit. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 83737, Dec. 22, 2020.

A location at which a national bank operates a loan production office (LPO), a deposit production office (DPO), and a remote service unit (RSU) is not a “branch” within the meaning of 12 U.S.C. 36(j) by virtue of that combination. Since an LPO, DPO, or RSU is not, individually, a branch under 12 U.S.C. 36(j), any combination of these facilities at one location does not create a branch.
