##### ยง 7.3000 National bank hours and closings. #####

(a) *Bank hours.* A national bank's board of directors should review its banking hours, and, independently of any other bank, take appropriate action to establish a schedule of banking hours.

(b) *Emergency closings.* Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 95(b)(1), the Comptroller of the Currency (Comptroller), a state, or a legally authorized state official may declare a day a legal holiday if emergency conditions exist. That day is a legal holiday for national banks or their offices in the affected geographic area (*i.e.,* throughout the country, in a state, or in part of a state). Emergency conditions include natural disasters and civil and municipal emergencies (*e.g.,* severe flooding, or a power emergency declared by a local power company or government requesting that businesses in the affected area close). The Comptroller issues a proclamation authorizing the emergency closing in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 95 at the time of the emergency condition, or soon thereafter. When the Comptroller, a State, or a legally authorized State official declares a legal holiday due to emergency conditions, a national bank may temporarily limit or suspend operations at its affected offices. Alternatively, the national bank may continue its operations unless the Comptroller by written order directs otherwise.

(c) *Ceremonial closings.* A state or a legally authorized state official may declare a day a legal holiday for ceremonial reasons. When a state or a legally authorized state official declares a day to be a legal holiday for ceremonial reasons, a national bank may choose to remain open or to close.

(d) *Liability.* A national bank should assure that all liabilities or other obligations under the applicable law due to the bank's closing are satisfied.
