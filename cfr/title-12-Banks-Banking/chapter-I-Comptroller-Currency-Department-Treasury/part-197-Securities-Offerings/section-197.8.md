##### § 197.8 Use of the offering circular. #####

(a) An offering circular or amendment declared effective by the OCC shall not be used more than nine months after the effective date, unless the information contained therein is as of a date not more than 16 months prior to such use.

(b) An offering circular filed under § 197.5(b)(3) of this part shall not extend the period for which an effective offering circular or amendment may be used under paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) If any event arises, or change in fact occurs, after the effective date and such event or change in fact, individually or in the aggregate, results in the offering circular containing any untrue statement of material fact, or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make statements made in the offering circular not misleading under the circumstances, then no offering circular, which has been declared effective under this part, shall be used until an amendment reflecting such event or change in fact has been filed with, and declared effective by, the OCC.
