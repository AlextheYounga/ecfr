##### § 167.4 Capital directives. #####

(a) *Issuance of a Capital Directive* - (1) *Purpose.* (i) In addition to any other action authorized by law, the OCC may issue a capital directive to a Federal savings association that does not have an amount of capital satisfying its minimum capital requirement. Issuance of such a capital directive may be based on a Federal savings association's noncompliance with the risk-based capital requirement, the leverage ratio requirement, the tangible capital requirement, or individual minimum capital requirement established under this part, by a written agreement under 12 U.S.C. 1464(s), or as a condition for approval of an application. A capital directive may order a Federal savings association to:

(A) Achieve its minimum capital requirement by a specified date;

(B) Adhere to the compliance schedule for achieving its individual minimum capital requirement;

(C) Submit and adhere to a capital plan acceptable to the OCC describing the means and a time schedule by which the savings association shall reach its required capital level;

(D) Take other action, including but not limited to, reducing the savings association's assets or its rate of liability growth, or imposing restrictions on the savings association's payment of dividends, in order to cause the savings association to reach its required capital level;

(E) Take any action authorized under § 167.10(e); or

(F) Take a combination of any of these actions.

(ii) A capital directive issued under this section, including a plan submitted pursuant to a capital directive, is enforceable under 12 U.S.C. 1818 in the same manner and to the same extent as an effective and outstanding cease and desist order which has become final under 12 U.S.C. 1818.

(2) *Notice of intent to issue capital directive.* The OCC will determine whether to initiate the process of issuing a capital directive. The OCC will notify a Federal savings association in writing by registered mail of its intention to issue a capital directive. The notice will state:

(i) The reasons for issuance of the capital directive and

(ii) The proposed contents of the capital directive.

(3) *Response to notice of intent.* (i) A Federal savings association may respond to the notice of intent by submitting its own compliance plan, or may propose an alternative plan. The response should also include any information that the savings association wishes the OCC to consider in deciding whether to issue a capital directive. The response must be in writing and be delivered within 30 days after the receipt of the notices. Such response must be filed in accordance with §§ 116.30 and 116.40 of this chapter. In its discretion, the OCC may extend the time period for the response for good cause. The OCC may, for good cause, shorten the 30-day time period for response by the insured savings association:

(A) When, in the opinion of the OCC, the condition of the savings association so requires, and the OCC informs the savings association of the shortened response period in the notice;

(B) With the consent of the savings association; or

(C) When the savings association already has advised the OCC that it cannot or will not achieve its applicable minimum capital requirement.

(ii) Failure to respond within 30 days of receipt, or such other time period as may be specified by the OCC, may constitute a waiver of any objections to the capital directive unless the OCC grants an extension of the time period for good cause.

(4) *Decision.* After the closing date of the Federal savings association's response period, or upon receipt of the savings association's response, if earlier, the OCC shall consider the savings association's response and may seek additional information or clarification of the response. Thereafter, the OCC will determine whether or not to issue a capital directive and, if one is to be issued, whether it should be as originally proposed or in modified form.

(5) *Service and effectiveness.* (i) Upon issuance, a capital directive will be served upon the Federal savings association. It will include or be accompanied by a statement of reasons for its issuance and shall address the responses received during the response period.

(ii) A capital directive shall become effective upon the expiration of 30 days after service upon the savings association, unless the OCC determines that a shorter effective period is necessary either on account of the public interest or in order to achieve the capital directive's purpose. If the savings association has consented to issuance of the capital directive, it may become effective immediately. A capital directive shall remain in effect and enforceable unless, and then only to the extent that, it is stayed, modified, or terminated by the OCC.

(6) *Change in circumstances.* Upon a change in circumstances, a Federal savings association may submit a request to the OCC to reconsider the terms of the capital directive or consider changes in the savings association's capital plan issued under a directive for the savings association to achieve its minimum capital requirement. If the OCC believes such a change is warranted, the OCC may modify the savings association's capital requirement or may refuse to make such modification if it determines that there are not significant changes in circumstances. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the capital directive and capital plan shall continue in full force and effect.

(b) *Relation to other administrative actions.* The OCC -

(1) May consider a Federal savings association's progress in adhering to any capital plan required under this section whenever such savings association or any affiliate of such savings association (including any company which controls such savings association) seeks approval for any proposal that would have the effect of diverting earnings, diminishing capital, or otherwise impeding such savings association's progress in meeting its minimum capital requirement; and

(2) May disapprove any proposal referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section if the OCC determines that the proposal would adversely affect the ability of the savings association on a current or pro forma basis to satisfy its capital requirement.
