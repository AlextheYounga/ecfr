(i) Addresses the savings association's need for increased capital;

(ii) Describes the manner in which the savings association will increase capital so as to achieve compliance with capital standards;

(iii) Specifies types and levels of activities in which the savings association will engage;

(iv) Requires any increase in assets to be accompanied by increase in tangible capital not less in percentage amount than the leverage limit then applicable;

(v) Requires any increase in assets to be accompanied by an increase in capital not less in percentage amount than required under the risk-based capital standard then applicable; and

(vi) Is acceptable to the Comptroller.

(3) To be acceptable to the Comptroller under this section, a plan must, in addition to satisfying all of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(v) of this section, contain a certification that while the plan is under review by the OCC, the savings association will not, without the prior written approval of the OCC:

(i) Grow beyond net interest credited;

(ii) Make any capital distributions; or

(iii) Act inconsistently with any other limitations on activities established by statute, regulation or by the OCC in supervisory guidance for Federal savings associations not meeting capital standards.

(4) If the plan submitted to the Comptroller under paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not approved by the Comptroller, the savings association shall immediately and without any further action, be subject to the following restrictions:

(i) It may not increase its assets beyond the amount held on the day it receives written notice of the Comptroller's disapproval of the plan; and

(ii) It must comply with any other restrictions or limitations set forth in the written notice of the Comptroller's disapproval of the plan.

(b) The Comptroller shall:

(1) Prohibit any asset growth by any Federal savings association not in compliance with capital standards, *except* as provided in paragraph (d) of this section; and

(2) Require any Federal savings association not in compliance with capital standards to comply with a capital directive issued by the Comptroller which may include the restrictions contained in paragraph (e) of this section and any other restrictions the Comptroller determines appropriate.

(c) A Federal savings association that wishes to obtain an exemption from the sanctions provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must file a request for exemption with the OCC. Such request must include a capital plan that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(d) The Comptroller may permit any Federal savings association that is subject to paragraph (b) of this section to increase its assets in an amount not exceeding the amount of net interest credited to the savings association's deposit liabilities, if:

(2) Any increase in assets is accompanied by an increase in tangible capital in an amount not less than 3% of the increase in assets;

(3) Any increase in assets is accompanied by an increase in capital not less in percentage amount than required under the risk-based capital standards then applicable;

(4) Any increase in assets is invested in low-risk assets; and

(5) The savings association's ratio of core capital to total assets is not less than the ratio existing on January 1, 1991.

(e) If a Federal savings association fails to meet the risk-based capital requirement, the leverage ratio requirement, or the tangible capital requirement established under this part, the Comptroller may, through enforcement proceedings or otherwise, require such savings association to take one or more of the following corrective actions:

(1) Increase the amount of its regulatory capital to a specified level or levels;

(2) Convene a meeting or meetings with the supervision staff of the OCC for the purpose of accomplishing the objectives of this section;
