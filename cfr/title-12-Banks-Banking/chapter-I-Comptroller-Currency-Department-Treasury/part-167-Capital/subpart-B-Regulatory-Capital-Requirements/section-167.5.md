##### § 167.5 Components of capital. #####

(a) *Core Capital.* (1) The following elements,2 less the amount of any deductions pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, comprise a Federal savings association's core capital:

2 Stock issues where the dividend is reset periodically based on current market conditions and the savings association's current credit rating, including but not limited to, auction rate, money market or remarketable preferred stock, are assigned to supplementary capital, regardless of cumulative or noncumulative characteristics.

(i) Common stockholders' equity (including retained earnings);

(ii) Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus;3

3 Stock issued by subsidiaries that may not be counted by the parent savings association on the Call Report or TFR, as appropriate, likewise shall not be considered in calculating capital. For example, preferred stock issued by a Federal savings association or a subsidiary that is, in effect, collateralized by assets of the savings association or one of its subsidiaries shall not be included in capital. Similarly, common stock with mandatorily redeemable provisions is not includable in core capital.

(iii) Minority interests in the equity accounts of the subsidiaries that are fully consolidated.

(iv) Nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits of mutual savings associations (excluding any treasury shares held by the savings association) meeting the criteria of regulations and memoranda of the OCC to the extent that such accounts or deposits have no fixed maturity date, cannot be withdrawn at the option of the accountholder, and do not earn interest that carries over to subsequent periods;

(v) [Reserved]

(2) *Deductions from core capital.* (i) Intangible assets, as defined in § 167.1 of this part, are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital, except as otherwise provided by § 167.12 of this part.

(ii) Servicing assets that are not includable in core capital pursuant to § 167.12 of this part are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital.

(iii) Credit-enhancing interest-only strips that are not includable in core capital under § 167.12 of this part are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital.

(iv) Investments, both equity and debt, in subsidiaries that are not includable subsidiaries (including those subsidiaries where the savings association has a minority ownership interest) are deducted from assets and, thus core capital except as provided in paragraphs (a)(2)(v) and (a)(2)(vi) of this section.

(v) If a Federal savings association has any investments (both debt and equity) in one or more subsidiaries engaged in any activity that would not fall within the scope of activities in which includable subsidiaries may engage, it must deduct such investments from assets and, thus, core capital in accordance with this paragraph (a)(2)(v). The savings association must first deduct from assets and, thus, core capital the amount by which any investments in such subsidiary(ies) exceed the amount of such investments held by the savings association as of April 12, 1989. Next the savings association must deduct from assets and, thus, core capital, the savings association's investments in and extensions of credit to the subsidiary on the date as of which the savings association's capital is being determined.

(vi) If a Federal savings association holds a subsidiary (either directly or through a subsidiary) that is itself a domestic depository institution, the OCC may, in its sole discretion upon determining that the amount of core capital that would be required would be higher if the assets and liabilities of such subsidiary were consolidated with those of the parent savings association than the amount that would be required if the parent savings association's investment were deducted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) and (a)(2)(v) of this section, consolidate the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary with those of the parent savings association in calculating the capital adequacy of the parent savings association, regardless of whether the subsidiary would otherwise be an includable subsidiary as defined in § 167.1 of this part.

(vii) Deferred tax assets that are not includable in core capital pursuant to § 167.12 of this part are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital.

(b) *Supplementary Capital.* Supplementary capital counts towards a Federal savings association's total capital up to a maximum of 100% of the savings association's core capital. The following elements comprise a Federal savings association's supplementary capital:

(1) *Permanent Capital Instruments.* (i) Cumulative perpetual preferred stock and other perpetual preferred stock4 issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the OCC;

4 Other public disclosure requirements continue to apply - for example, Federal securities law and regulatory reporting requirements.

(ii) Mutual capital certificates issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the OCC;

(iii) Nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits (excluding any treasury shares held by the savings association) meeting the criteria of 12 CFR 161.42 to the extent that such instruments are not included in core capital under paragraph (a) of this section;

(iv) Perpetual subordinated debt issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the OCC; and

(v) Mandatory convertible subordinated debt (capital notes) issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the OCC.

(2) *Maturing Capital Instruments.* (i) Subordinated debt issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the OCC;

(ii) Intermediate-term preferred stock issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the OCC and any related surplus:

(iii) Mandatory convertible subordinated debt (commitment notes) issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the OCC; and

(iv) Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock that was issued before July 23, 1985 or issued pursuant to regulations and memoranda of the Office of Thrift Supervision and approved in writing by the FSLIC for inclusion as regulatory capital before or after issuance.

(3) *Transition rules for maturing capital instruments* - (i) [Reserved]

(ii) A Federal savings association issuing maturing capital instruments after November 7, 1989, may choose, subject to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, to include such instruments pursuant to either paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) or (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

(A) At the beginning of each of the last five years of the life of the maturing capital instrument, the amount that is eligible to be included as supplementary capital is reduced by 20% of the original amount of that instrument (net of redemptions).5

5 Capital instruments may be redeemed prior to maturity and without the prior approval of the OCC, as long as the instruments are redeemed with the proceeds of, or replaced by, a like amount of a similar or higher quality capital instrument. However, the OCC must be notified in writing at least 30 days in advance of such redemption.

(B) Only the aggregate amount of maturing capital instruments that mature in any one year during the seven years immediately prior to an instrument's maturity that does not exceed 20% of an institution's capital will qualify as supplementary capital.

(C) Once a Federal savings association selects either paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) or (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section for the issuance of a maturing capital instrument, it must continue to elect that option for all subsequent issuances of maturing capital instruments for as long as there is a balance outstanding of such issuances. Only when such issuances have all been repaid and the savings association has no balance of such issuances outstanding may the savings association elect the other option.

(4) *Allowance for loan and lease losses.* Allowance for loan and lease losses established under regulations and memoranda of the OCC to a maximum of 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets.6

6*See* Security Guidelines, II.B. and III.D. Further, the Agencies note that, in addition to contractual obligations to a financial institution, a service provider may be required to implement its own comprehensive information security program in accordance with the Safeguards Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), 16 CFR part 314.

(5) *Unrealized gains on equity securities.* Up to 45 percent of unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values may be included in supplementary capital. Unrealized gains are unrealized holding gains, net of unrealized holding losses, before income taxes, calculated as the amount, if any, by which fair value exceeds historical cost. The OCC may disallow such inclusion in the calculation of supplementary capital if the OCC determines that the equity securities are not prudently valued.

(c) *Total capital.* (1) A Federal savings association's total capital equals the sum of its core capital and supplementary capital (to the extent that such supplementary capital does not exceed 100% of its core capital).

(2) The following assets, in addition to assets required to be deducted elsewhere in calculating core capital, are deducted from assets for purposes of determining total capital:

(i) Reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments; and

(ii) All equity investments.
