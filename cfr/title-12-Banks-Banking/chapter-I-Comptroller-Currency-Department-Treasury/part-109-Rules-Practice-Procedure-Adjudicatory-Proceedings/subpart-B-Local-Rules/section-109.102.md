##### § 109.102 Discovery. #####

(a) *In general.* A party may take the deposition of an expert, or of a person, including another party, who has direct knowledge of matters that are non-privileged, relevant and material to the proceeding and where there is a need for the deposition. The deposition of experts shall be limited to those experts who are expected to testify at the hearing.

(b) *Notice.* A party desiring to take a deposition shall give reasonable notice in writing to the deponent and to every other party to the proceeding. The notice must state the time and place for taking the deposition and the name and address of the person to be deposed.

(c) *Time limits.* A party may take depositions at any time after the commencement of the proceeding, but no later than ten days before the scheduled hearing date, except with permission of the administrative law judge for good cause shown.

(d) *Conduct of the deposition.* The witness must be duly sworn, and each party shall have the right to examine the witness with respect to all non-privileged, relevant and material matters of which the witness has factual, direct and personal knowledge. Objections to questions or exhibits shall be in short form, stating the grounds for objection. Failure to object to questions or exhibits is not a waiver except where the grounds for the objection might have been avoided if the objection had been timely presented. The court reporter shall transcribe or otherwise record the witness's testimony, as agreed among the parties.

(e) *Protective orders.* At any time after notice of a deposition has been given, a party may file a motion for the issuance of a protective order. Such protective order may prohibit, terminate, or limit the scope or manner of the taking of a deposition. The administrative law judge shall grant such protective order upon a showing of sufficient grounds, including that the deposition:

(1) Is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome;

(2) Involves privileged, investigative, trial preparation, irrelevant or immaterial matters; or

(3) Is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as to unreasonably annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent.

(f) *Fees.* Deposition witnesses, including expert witnesses, shall be paid the same expenses in the same manner as are paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States in proceedings in which the United States Government is a party. Expenses in accordance with this paragraph shall be paid by the party seeking to take the deposition.

(g) *Deposition subpoenas*—(1) *Issuance.* At the request of a party, the administrative law judge shall issue a subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition. The attendance of a witness may be required from any place in any state or territory that is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or as otherwise permitted by law.

(2) *Service.* The party requesting the subpoena must serve it on the person named therein or upon that person's counsel, by any of the methods identified in § 109.11(d) of this part. The party serving the subpoena must file proof of service with the administrative law judge.

(3) *Motion to quash.* A person named in the subpoena or a party may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena. A statement of the reasons for the motion must accompany it and a copy of the motion must be served on the party that requested the subpoena. The motion must be made prior to the time for compliance specified in the subpoena and not more than ten days after the date of service of the subpoena, or if the subpoena is served within 15 days of the hearing, within five days after the date of service.

(4) *Enforcement of deposition subpoena.* Enforcement of a deposition subpoena shall be in accordance with the procedures of § 109.27(d) of this part.
