##### ยง 193.4 Condensed financial information [Parent only]. #####

(a) The information prescribed by Schedule III pursuant to section IV of appendix A to this part shall be presented in a note to the financial statements when the restricted net assets (17 CFR 210.4-08(e)(3)) of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year. The investment in and indebtedness of and to association subsidiaries shall be stated separately in the condensed balance sheet from amounts for other subsidiaries; and the amount of cash dividends paid to the parent association for each of the last three years by association subsidiaries shall be stated separately in the condensed income statement from amounts for other subsidiaries.

(b) For purposes of the above test, restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that amount of the association's proportionate share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of the end of the most recent year may not be transferred to the parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances, or cash dividends without the consent of a third party (*i.e.,* lender, regulatory agency, foreign government, etc.).

(c) Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks (*See* item I (22) in appendix A to this part) and minority interest (*See* item I (21) in appendix A to this part) shall be deducted in computing net assets for purposes of this test.
