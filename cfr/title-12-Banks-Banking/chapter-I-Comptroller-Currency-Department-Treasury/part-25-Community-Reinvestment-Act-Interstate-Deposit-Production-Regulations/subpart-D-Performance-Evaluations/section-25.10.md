##### § 25.10 Performance standards and ratings, in general. #####

(a) *Performance standards.* The OCC assesses the CRA performance of a bank in an examination as follows:

(1) *General performance standards.* (i) The OCC assesses the CRA performance of a bank other than banks described in paragraphs (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(4) of this section based on the bank's application of the general performance standards and determination of its presumptive ratings under § 25.13.

(ii) The OCC determines the assigned ratings for a bank evaluated under § 25.13 as provided in § 25.19.

(iii) The OCC determines the state or multistate metropolitan statistical area ratings for a bank evaluated under § 25.13 as provided in § 25.20.

(2) *Small bank and intermediate bank performance standards.* (i) The OCC applies the small bank and intermediate bank performance standards, as provided in § 25.14, in evaluating the performance of a small bank or intermediate bank, unless the bank is evaluated under an approved strategic plan as described under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or elects to opt in to the general performance standards under paragraph (b) of this section.

(ii) The OCC assigns a small bank evaluated under the small bank and intermediate bank performance standards in § 25.14 lending test and bank ratings as provided for in appendix A of this part.

(iii) The OCC assigns an intermediate bank evaluated under the small bank and intermediate bank performance standards in § 25.14 lending test, community development test, and bank ratings as provided in appendix A of this part.

(3) *Wholesale and limited purpose bank performance standards.* (i) The OCC applies the wholesale and limited purpose bank performance standards, as provided in § 25.15, in evaluating the performance of a wholesale or limited purpose bank, unless the bank is evaluated under an approved strategic plan as described under paragraph (a)(4) of this section or elects to opt in to the general performance standards under paragraph (b) of this section.

(ii) The OCC assigns a wholesale or limited purpose bank evaluated under the wholesale and limited purpose bank performance standards in § 25.15 community development test and bank ratings as provided for in appendix A of this part.

(4) *Strategic plan.* The OCC evaluates the performance of a bank under a strategic plan if the bank submits, and the OCC approves, a strategic plan as provided in § 25.18.

(b) *General performance standards opt in.* A small, intermediate, wholesale, or limited purpose bank may elect to opt in to be evaluated under the general performance standards described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. A small, intermediate, wholesale, or limited purpose bank that elects to be evaluated under the general performance standards must collect, maintain, and report the data required for other banks under §§ 25.21, 25.25, and 25.26. Once a small, intermediate, wholesale, or limited purpose bank elects to opt in, it must complete at least one evaluation period under the general performance standards and may elect no more than once to opt out of the general performance standards. A small, intermediate, wholesale, or limited purpose bank that opts out from the general performance standards will revert to being evaluated according to the corresponding performance standards described in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, unless the bank is evaluated under an approved strategic plan as described under (a)(4) of this section.

(c) *Safe and sound operations.* This part and the CRA do not require a bank to make loans or investments or to provide services that are inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the contrary, the OCC anticipates that banks can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound loans, investments, and services on which the banks expect to make a profit. Banks are permitted and encouraged to develop and apply flexible underwriting standards for loans that benefit low- or moderate-income census tracts or individuals, only if consistent with safe and sound operations.
