(iv) The bank's development of business infrastructure and staffing to support the purpose of this part; and

(v) The responsiveness of the bank's qualifying activities to the needs of the community;

(i) The demand for qualifying activities, including, for example, credit needs and market opportunities identified in a Federal Home Loan Bank Targeted Community Lending Plan as provided for in 12 CFR 1290.6(a)(5) or a U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development Consolidated Plan as provided for in 24 CFR part 91, as applicable;

(4) Any written comments about assessment area needs and opportunities submitted to the bank or the OCC; and
