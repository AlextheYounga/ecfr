##### ยง 25.41 Assessment area delineation. #####

(a) *In general.* A bank or savings association shall delineate one or more assessment areas within which the appropriate Federal banking agency evaluates the bank's or savings association's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community. The appropriate Federal banking agency does not evaluate the bank's or savings association's delineation of its assessment area(s) as a separate performance criterion, but the appropriate Federal banking agency reviews the delineation for compliance with the requirements of this section.

(b) *Geographic area(s) for wholesale or limited purpose banks or savings associations.* The assessment area(s) for a wholesale or limited purpose bank or savings association must consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns, in which the bank or savings association has its main office, branches, and deposit-taking ATMs.

(c) *Geographic area(s) for other banks and savings association.* The assessment area(s) for a bank or savings association other than a wholesale or limited purpose bank or savings association must:

(1) Consist generally of one or more MSAs or metropolitan divisions (using the MSA or metropolitan division boundaries that were in effect as of January 1 of the calendar year in which the delineation is made) or one or more contiguous political subdivisions, such as counties, cities, or towns; and

(2) Include the geographies in which the bank or savings association has its main office, its branches, and its deposit-taking ATMs, as well as the surrounding geographies in which the bank or savings association has originated or purchased a substantial portion of its loans (including home mortgage loans, small business and small farm loans, and any other loans the bank or savings association chooses, such as those consumer loans on which the bank or savings association elects to have its performance assessed).

(d) *Adjustments to geographic area(s).* A bank or savings association may adjust the boundaries of its assessment area(s) to include only the portion of a political subdivision that it reasonably can be expected to serve. An adjustment is particularly appropriate in the case of an assessment area that otherwise would be extremely large, of unusual configuration, or divided by significant geographic barriers.

(e) *Limitations on the delineation of an assessment area.* Each bank's or savings associations assessment area(s):

(1) Must consist only of whole geographies;

(2) May not reflect illegal discrimination;

(3) May not arbitrarily exclude low- or moderate-income geographies, taking into account the bank's or savings association's size and financial condition; and

(4) May not extend substantially beyond an MSA boundary or beyond a state boundary unless the assessment area is located in a multistate MSA. If a bank or savings association serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond a state boundary, the bank or savings association shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas in each state. If a bank or savings association serves a geographic area that extends substantially beyond an MSA boundary, the bank or savings association shall delineate separate assessment areas for the areas inside and outside the MSA.

(f) *Banks and savings association serving military personnel.* Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a bank or savings association whose business predominantly consists of serving the needs of military personnel or their dependents who are not located within a defined geographic area may delineate its entire deposit customer base as its assessment area.

(g) *Use of assessment area(s).* The appropriate Federal banking agency uses the assessment area(s) delineated by a bank or savings association in its evaluation of the bank's or savings association's CRA performance unless the appropriate Federal banking agency determines that the assessment area(s) do not comply with the requirements of this section.
