##### § 25.02 Effect of CRA performance on applications. #####

(a) *CRA performance.* Among other factors, the OCC takes into account the record of performance under the CRA of each applicant bank in considering an application for:

(1) The establishment of a domestic branch or non-branch deposit-taking facility;

(2) The relocation of the main office or a domestic branch;

(3) Under the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c)), the merger or consolidation with or the acquisition of assets or assumption of liabilities of an insured depository institution;

(4) The conversion of an insured depository institution to a national bank charter;

(5) A savings association charter; and

(6) Acquisitions subject to section 10(e) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1467a(e)).

(b) *Charter application.* An applicant (other than an insured depository institution) for a national bank or a Federal savings association charter must submit with its application a description of how it will meet its CRA objectives, if applicable. The OCC takes the description into account in considering the application and may deny or condition approval on that basis.

(c) *Interested parties.* The OCC takes into account any views expressed by interested parties that are submitted in accordance with the OCC's procedures set forth in part 5 of this chapter in considering CRA performance in an application listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) *Denial or conditional approval of application.* A bank's record of performance may be the basis for denying or conditioning approval of an application listed in paragraph (a) of this section.

(e) *Insured depository institution.* For purposes of this section, the term “insured depository institution” has the same meaning as this term is given in 12 U.S.C. 1813.
