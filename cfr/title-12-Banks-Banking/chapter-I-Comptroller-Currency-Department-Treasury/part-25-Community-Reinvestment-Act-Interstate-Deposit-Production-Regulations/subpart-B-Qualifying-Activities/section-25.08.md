##### § 25.08 Qualifying activities value. #####

(a) *Bank's qualifying activities value.* A bank evaluated under § 25.13 calculates its qualifying activities value annually based on the quantified dollar value of all qualifying activities originated, made, performed, or on the bank's balance sheet during the year. The qualifying activities value equals the *sum,* during a given annual period, of:

(1) The quantified dollar value of qualifying loans and community development investments originated, made, or performed by the bank during the year or on the bank's balance sheet during the year, as adjusted in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(2) The aggregate:

(i) Quantified dollar value of community development services conducted during the year, as adjusted in paragraph (b) of this section;

(ii) Quantified dollar value of in-kind donations made during the year, as adjusted in paragraph (b) of this section; and

(iii) Quantified dollar value of monetary donations made during the year, as adjusted in paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) *Multipliers.* (1) To be eligible for the multipliers in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the quantified dollar value of a bank's current evaluation period community development loans, community development investments, and community development services must be approximately equal to the quantified dollar value of these activities considered in the bank's prior evaluation period. The quantified dollar value of qualifying activities originated, made, conducted or purchased by a bank during the evaluation period after this requirement is met will be adjusted using the multipliers in paragraphs (b)(2)-(b)(3) of this section, as applicable.

(2) When calculating the bank's qualifying activity value or an assessment area qualifying activities value, the quantified dollar value of the following qualifying activities, except for activities quantified under § 25.07(d)(3), will be adjusted by *multiplying* the quantified dollar value by 2.

(i) Activities provided to or that support minority depository institutions, women's depository institutions, Community Development Financial Institutions, and low-income credit unions, except activities related to mortgage-backed securities;

(ii) Other community development investments, except community development investments in mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds;

(iii) Other community development services;

(iv) Other affordable housing-related community development loans; and

(v) Retail loans generated by branches in low- and moderate-income census tracts.

(3) In addition to any multiplier under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, when calculating the bank's qualifying activities value or an assessment area qualifying activities value, the quantified dollar value of the qualifying activities in CRA deserts, except for activities quantified under § 25.07(d)(3), will be adjusted by multiplying the quantified dollar value by 2.

(4) Qualifying activities that receive a multiplier under paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section may be eligible for a multiplier of up to 4 times their quantified dollar value based on the OCC's determination of the activity's responsiveness, innovativeness, or complexity.

(c) *Assessment area qualifying activities value.* A bank evaluated under § 25.13 calculates its assessment area qualifying activities value for each assessment area by using the process described in paragraph (a) of this section for qualifying activities located in the assessment area and originated, made, or performed by the bank during the year or were on the bank's balance sheet during the year.
