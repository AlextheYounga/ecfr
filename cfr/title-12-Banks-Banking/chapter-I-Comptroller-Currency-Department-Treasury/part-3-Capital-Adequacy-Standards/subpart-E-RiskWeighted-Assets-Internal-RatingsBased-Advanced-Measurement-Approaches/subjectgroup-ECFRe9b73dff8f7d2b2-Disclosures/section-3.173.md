<sup>1</sup> Table 5 to § 3.173 does not cover equity exposures, which should be reported in Table 9.

<sup>2</sup>See, for example, ASC Topic 815-10 and 210-20 as they may be amended from time to time.

<sup>3</sup> Geographical areas may comprise individual countries, groups of countries, or regions within countries. A national bank or Federal savings association might choose to define the geographical areas based on the way the company's portfolio is geographically managed. The criteria used to allocate the loans to geographical areas must be specified.

<sup>4</sup> A national bank or Federal savings association is encouraged also to provide an analysis of the aging of past-due loans.

<sup>5</sup> The portion of the general allowance that is not allocated to a geographical area should be disclosed separately.

<sup>6</sup> The reconciliation should include the following: A description of the allowance; the opening balance of the allowance; charge-offs taken against the allowance during the period; amounts provided (or reversed) for estimated probable loan losses during the period; any other adjustments (for example, exchange rate differences, business combinations, acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries), including transfers between allowances; and the closing balance of the allowance. Charge-offs and recoveries that have been recorded directly to the income statement should be disclosed separately.

<sup>1</sup> This disclosure item does not require a detailed description of the model in full - it should provide the reader with a broad overview of the model approach, describing definitions of the variables and methods for estimating and validating those variables set out in the quantitative risk disclosures below. This should be done for each of the four category/subcategories. The national bank or Federal savings association must disclose any significant differences in approach to estimating these variables within each category/subcategories.

<sup>2</sup> The PD, LGD and EAD disclosures in Table 6 (c) to § 3.173 should reflect the effects of collateral, qualifying master netting agreements, eligible guarantees and eligible credit derivatives as defined under this part. Disclosure of each PD grade should include the exposure-weighted average PD for each grade. Where a national bank or Federal savings association aggregates PD grades for the purposes of disclosure, this should be a representative breakdown of the distribution of PD grades used for regulatory capital purposes.

<sup>3</sup> Outstanding loans and EAD on undrawn commitments can be presented on a combined basis for these disclosures.

<sup>4</sup> These disclosures are a way of further informing the reader about the reliability of the information provided in the “quantitative disclosures: Risk assessment” over the long run. The disclosures are requirements from year-end 2010; in the meantime, early adoption is encouraged. The phased implementation is to allow a national bank or Federal savings association sufficient time to build up a longer run of data that will make these disclosures meaningful.

<sup>5</sup> This disclosure item is not intended to be prescriptive about the period used for this assessment. Upon implementation, it is expected that a national bank or Federal savings association would provide these disclosures for as long a set of data as possible - for example, if a national bank or Federal savings association has 10 years of data, it might choose to disclose the average default rates for each PD grade over that 10-year period. Annual amounts need not be disclosed.

<sup>6</sup> A national bank or Federal savings association must provide this further decomposition where it will allow users greater insight into the reliability of the estimates provided in the “quantitative disclosures: Risk assessment.” In particular, it must provide this information where there are material differences between its estimates of PD, LGD or EAD compared to actual outcomes over the long run. The national bank or Federal savings association must also provide explanations for such differences.

<sup>1</sup> The national bank or Federal savings association must describe the structure of resecuritizations in which it participates; this description must be provided for the main categories of resecuritization products in which the national bank or Federal savings association is active.

<sup>2</sup> For example, these roles would include originator, investor, servicer, provider of credit enhancement, sponsor, liquidity provider, or swap provider.

<sup>3</sup> For example, money market mutual funds should be listed individually, and personal and private trusts, should be noted collectively.

<sup>4</sup> “Exposures securitized” include underlying exposures originated by the bank, whether generated by them or purchased, and recognized in the balance sheet, from third parties, and third-party exposures included in sponsored transactions. Securitization transactions (including underlying exposures originally on the bank's balance sheet and underlying exposures acquired by the bank from third-party entities) in which the originating bank does not retain any securitization exposure should be shown separately but need only be reported for the year of inception.

<sup>5</sup> A national bank or Federal savings association is required to disclose exposures regardless of whether there is a capital charge under this part.

<sup>6</sup> A national bank or Federal savings association must include credit-related other than temporary impairment (OTTI).

<sup>7</sup> For example, charge-offs/allowances (if the assets remain on the bank's balance sheet) or credit-related OTTI of I/O strips and other retained residual interests, as well as recognition of liabilities for probable future financial support required of the bank with respect to securitized assets.
