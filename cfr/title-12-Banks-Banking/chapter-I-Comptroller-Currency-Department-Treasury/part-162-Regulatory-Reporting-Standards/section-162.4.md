##### ยง 162.4 Audit of savings associations. #####

(a) *General.* The OCC may require, at any time, an independent audit of the financial statements of, or the application of procedures agreed upon by the OCC to a savings association or affiliate (as defined by 12 CFR 563.41, or upon issuance of superseding regulations by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, such superseding regulations) by qualified independent public accountants when needed for any safety and soundness reason identified by the OCC.

(b) *Audits required for safety and soundness purposes.* The OCC requires an independent audit for safety and soundness purposes if a savings association has received a composite rating of 3, 4 or 5 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System.

(c) *Procedures.* (1) When the OCC requires an independent audit because such an audit is needed for safety and soundness purposes, the Comptroller shall determine whether the audit was conducted and filed in a manner satisfactory to the OCC.

(2) The Comptroller may waive the independent audit requirement described at paragraph (b)(1) of this section, if the Comptroller determines that an audit would not provide further information on safety and soundness issues relevant to the examination rating.

(3) When the OCC requires the application of procedures agreed upon for safety and soundness purposes, the Comptroller shall identify the procedures to be performed. The Comptroller shall also determine whether the agreed upon procedures were conducted and filed in a manner satisfactory to the OCC.

(d) *Qualifications for independent public accountants.* The audit shall be conducted by an independent public accountant who:

(1) Is registered or licensed to practice as a public accountant, and is in good standing, under the laws of the state or other political subdivision of the United States in which the savings association's or holding company's principal office is located;

(2) Agrees in the engagement letter to provide the OCC with access to and copies of any work papers, policies, and procedures relating to the services performed;

(3)(i) Is in compliance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) Code of Professional Conduct; and

(ii) Meets the independence requirements and interpretations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and its staff; and

(4) Has received, or is enrolled in, a peer review program that meets guidelines acceptable to the OCC.

(e) *Voluntary audits.* When a savings association or affiliate (as defined by 12 CFR 563.41, or upon issuance of superseding regulations by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, such superseding regulations) obtains an independent audit voluntarily, it must be performed by an independent public accountant who satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3)(i) of this section.
