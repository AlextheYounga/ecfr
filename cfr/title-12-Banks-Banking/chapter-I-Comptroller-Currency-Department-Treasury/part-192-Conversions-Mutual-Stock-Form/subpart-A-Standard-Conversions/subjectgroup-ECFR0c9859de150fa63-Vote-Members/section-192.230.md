##### § 192.230 Who is eligible to vote? #####

You determine members' eligibility to vote by setting a voting record date. You must set a voting record date that is not more than 60 days nor less than 20 days before your meeting, unless you are a state-chartered savings association and state law requires a different voting record date.
