##### § 192.460 How do I determine the initial balances of liquidation sub-accounts? #####

(a)(1) You determine the initial sub-account balance for a savings account held by an eligible account holder by multiplying the initial balance of the liquidation account by the following fraction: The numerator is the qualifying deposit in the savings account expressed in dollars on the eligibility record date. The denominator is total qualifying deposits of all eligible account holders on that date.

(2) You determine the initial sub-account balance for a savings account held by a supplemental eligible account holder by multiplying the initial balance of the liquidation account by the following fraction: The numerator is the qualifying deposit in the savings account expressed in dollars on the supplemental eligibility record date. The denominator is total qualifying deposits of all supplemental eligible account holders on that date.

(3) If an account holder holds a savings account on the eligibility record date and a separate savings account on the supplemental eligibility record date, you must compute separate sub-accounts for the qualifying deposits in the savings account on each record date.

(b) You may not increase the initial sub-account balances. You must decrease the initial balance under § 192.470 as depositors reduce or close their accounts.
