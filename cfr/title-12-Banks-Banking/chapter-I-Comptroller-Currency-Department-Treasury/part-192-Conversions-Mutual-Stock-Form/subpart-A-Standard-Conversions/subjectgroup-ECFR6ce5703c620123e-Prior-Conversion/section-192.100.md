(a) Your board, or a subcommittee of your board, must meet with the appropriate Federal banking agency before you pass your plan of conversion. The meeting may occur at the appropriate Federal banking agency or your offices at your option. At that meeting you must provide the appropriate Federal banking agency with a written strategic plan that outlines the objectives of the proposed conversion and the intended use of the conversion proceeds.

(b) You should also consult with the appropriate Federal banking agency before you file your application for conversion. The appropriate Federal banking agency will discuss the information that you must include in the application for conversion, general issues that you may confront in the conversion process, and any other pertinent issues.
