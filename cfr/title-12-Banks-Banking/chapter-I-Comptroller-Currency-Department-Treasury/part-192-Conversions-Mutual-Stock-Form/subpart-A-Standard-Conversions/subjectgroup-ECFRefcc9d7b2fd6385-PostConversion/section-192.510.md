##### § 192.510 May I repurchase shares after conversion? #####

(a) You may not repurchase your shares in the first year after the conversion except:

(1) In extraordinary circumstances, you may make open market repurchases of up to five percent of your outstanding stock in the first year after the conversion if you file a notice under § 192.515(a) and the appropriate Federal banking agency does not disapprove your repurchase. The appropriate Federal banking agency will not approve such repurchases unless the repurchase meets the standards in § 192.515(c), and the repurchase is consistent with paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) You may repurchase qualifying shares of a director or conduct an appropriate Federal banking agency- approved repurchase pursuant to an offer made to all shareholders of your association.

(3) Repurchases to fund management recognition plans that have been ratified by shareholders do not count toward the repurchase limitations in this section. Repurchases in the first year to fund such plans require prior written notification to the appropriate Federal banking agency.

(4) Purchases to fund tax qualified employee stock benefit plans do not count toward the repurchase limitations in this section.

(b) After the first year, you may repurchase your shares, subject to all other applicable regulatory and supervisory restrictions and paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) All stock repurchases are subject to the following restrictions.

(1) You may not repurchase your shares if the repurchase will reduce your regulatory capital below the amount required for your liquidation account under § 192.450. You must comply with the capital distribution requirements at § 5.55 of this chapter.

(2) The restrictions on share repurchases apply to a charitable organization under § 192.550. You must aggregate purchases of shares by the charitable organization with your repurchases.
