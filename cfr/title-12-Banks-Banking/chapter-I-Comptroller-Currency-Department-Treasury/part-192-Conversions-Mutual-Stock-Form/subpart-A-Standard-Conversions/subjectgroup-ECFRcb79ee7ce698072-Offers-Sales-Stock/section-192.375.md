##### § 192.375 How do I allocate my conversion shares if my shares are oversubscribed? #####

(a) If your conversion shares are oversubscribed by your eligible account holders, you must allocate shares among the eligible account holders so that each, to the extent possible, may purchase 100 shares.

(b) If your conversion shares are oversubscribed by your supplemental eligible account holders, you must allocate shares among the supplemental eligible account holders so that each, to the extent possible, may purchase 100 shares.

(c) If a person is an eligible account holder and a supplemental eligible account holder, you must include the eligible account holder's allocation in determining the number of conversion shares that you may allocate to the person as a supplemental eligible account holder.

(d) For conversion shares that you do not allocate under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you must allocate the shares among the eligible or supplemental eligible account holders equitably, based on the amounts of qualifying deposits. You must describe this method of allocation in your plan of conversion.

(e) If shares remain after you have allocated shares as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, and if your voting members oversubscribe, you must allocate your conversion shares among those members equitably. You must describe the method of allocation in your plan of conversion.
