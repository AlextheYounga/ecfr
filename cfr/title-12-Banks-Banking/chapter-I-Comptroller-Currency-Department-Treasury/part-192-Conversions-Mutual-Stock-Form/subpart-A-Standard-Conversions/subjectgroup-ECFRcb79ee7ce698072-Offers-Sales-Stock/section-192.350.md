(a) You must pay interest from the date you receive a payment for conversion shares until the date you complete or terminate the conversion. You must pay interest at no less than your passbook rate for amounts paid in cash, check, or money order.

(b) If a subscriber withdraws money from a savings account to purchase conversion shares, you must pay interest on the payment until you complete or terminate the conversion as if the withdrawn amount remained in the account.

(c) If a depositor fails to maintain the applicable minimum balance requirement because he or she withdraws money from a certificate of deposit to purchase conversion shares, you may cancel the certificate and pay interest at no less than your passbook rate on any remaining balance.
