##### ยง 192.10 May I form a holding company as part of my conversion. #####

You may convert to the stock form of ownership as part of a transaction where you organize a holding company to acquire all of your shares upon their issuance. In such a transaction, your holding company will offer rights to purchase its shares instead of your shares. Regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System address holding company application requirements.
