##### § 8.6 Fees for special examinations and investigations. #####

(a) *Fees.* Pursuant to the authority contained in 12 U.S.C. 16, 481, 482, 1467, and 1831c, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may assess a fee for:

(1) Examining the fiduciary activities of national banks and Federal savings associations and related entities;

(2) Conducting special examinations and investigations of national banks, Federal branches or agencies of foreign banks, and Federal savings associations;

(3) Conducting special examinations and investigations of an entity with respect to its performance of activities described in section 7(c) of the Bank Service Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1867(c)) if the OCC determines that assessment of the fee is warranted with regard to a particular bank or Federal savings association because of the high risk or unusual nature of the activities performed; the significance to the bank's or Federal saving association's operations and income of the activities performed; or the extent to which the bank or Federal savings association has sufficient systems, controls, and personnel to adequately monitor, measure, and control risks arising from such activities;

(4) Conducting special examinations and investigations of affiliates of national banks, Federal savings associations, and Federal branches or agencies of foreign banks;

(5) Conducting examinations and investigations made pursuant to 12 CFR part 5, Rules, Policies, and Procedures for Corporate Activities; and

(6) Conducting examinations of depository-institution permissible activities of nondepository institution subsidiaries of depository institution holding companies pursuant to section 605(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (12 U.S.C. 1831c).

(b) *Notice of Comptroller of the Currency fees.* The OCC publishes the fee schedule for fiduciary activities, special examinations and investigations, examinations of affiliates and examinations related to corporate activities in the “Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees” described in § 8.8.

(c) *Additional assessments on trust banks and trust Federal savings associations* - (1) *Independent trust banks and independent trust Federal savings associations.* The assessment of independent trust banks and independent trust Federal savings associations will include a fiduciary and related asset component, in addition to the assessment calculated according to § 8.2 of this part, as follows:

(i) *Minimum fee.* All independent trust banks and independent trust Federal savings associations will pay a minimum fee, to be provided in the “Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees.”

(ii) *Additional amount for independent trust banks and independent trust Federal savings associations with fiduciary and related assets in excess of $1 billion.* Independent trust banks and independent trust Federal savings associations with fiduciary and related assets in excess of $1 billion will pay an amount that exceeds the minimum fee. The amount to be paid will be calculated by multiplying the amount of fiduciary and related assets by a rate or rates provided by the OCC in the “Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees.”

(iii) *Surcharge based on the condition of the bank or of the Federal savings association.* Subject to any limit that the OCC prescribes in the “Notice of Comptroller of the Currency Fees,” the OCC shall adjust the semiannual assessment computed in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section by multiplying that figure by 1.5 for each independent trust bank and independent trust Federal savings association that receives a composite rating of 3 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (UFIRS) at its most recent examination and by 2.0 for each bank that receives a composite UFIRS rating of 4 or 5 at such examination.

(2) *Trust banks affiliated with full-service national banks and trust Federal savings associations affiliated with full-service Federal savings associations.* The OCC will assess a trust bank and a trust Federal savings association in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, notwithstanding that the bank is affiliated with a full-service national bank, or that the Federal savings association is affiliated with a full-service Federal savings association, if the OCC concludes that the affiliation is intended to evade the assessment regulation.
