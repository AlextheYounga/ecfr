##### ยง 155.310 How do I notify the OCC? #####

You must file a written notice with your OCC supervisory office at least 30 days before you establish a transactional Web site. The notice must do three things:

(a) Describe the transactional web site.

(b) Indicate the date the transactional web site will become operational.

(c) List a contact familiar with the deployment, operation, and security of the transactional web site.
