Federal Stock Charter

*Section 1. Corporate title.* The full corporate title of the association is \_\_.

*Section 2. Office.* The home office is located in \_\_ [city, state].

*Section 3. Duration.* The duration of the association is perpetual.

*Section 4. Purpose and powers.* The purpose of the association is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal savings association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and to exercise all of the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).

*Section 5. Capital stock.* The total number of shares of all classes of the capital stock that the association has the authority to issue is \_\_\_\_, all of which is common stock of par [or if no par is specified then shares have a stated] value of \_\_\_\_per share. The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors without the approval of its shareholders, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares must be paid in full before their issuance and may not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor future services may constitute payment or part payment for the issuance of shares of the association. The consideration for the shares must be cash, tangible or intangible property (to the extent direct investment in such property would be permitted to the association), labor, or services actually performed for the association, or any combination of the foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the value of such property, labor, or services, as determined by the board of directors of the association, is conclusive. Upon payment of such consideration, such shares are deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the retained earnings of the association that is transferred to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend is deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.

Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the association or in connection with the conversion of the association from the mutual to stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities) may be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or controlling persons of the association other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, unless the issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting. The holders of the common stock exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter provides that there will be no such cumulative voting. Subject to any provision for a liquidation account, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association, the holders of the common stock will be entitled, after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the association, to receive the remaining assets of the association available for distribution, in cash or in kind. Each share of common stock must have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.

*Section 6. Preemptive rights.* Holders of the capital stock of the association are not entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares of the association which may be issued.

*Section 7. Directors.* The association will be under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors, as stated in the association's bylaws, may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen except when a greater or lesser number is approved by the OCC.

*Section 8. Amendment of charter.* Except as provided in Section 5, no amendment, addition, alteration, change or repeal of this charter may be made, unless such is proposed by the board of directors of the association, approved by the shareholders by a majority of the votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting, unless a higher vote is otherwise required, and approved or preapproved by the OCC.

(f) *Charter amendments.* In order to adopt a charter amendment, a Federal stock savings association must comply with the following requirements:

(1) *Board of directors approval.* The board of directors of the association must adopt a resolution proposing the charter amendment that states the text of such amendment;

(2) *Form of filing*—(i) *Application requirement.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, a Federal stock savings association must file the proposed charter amendment with, and obtain the prior approval of the OCC.

(A) *Expedited review.* Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the charter amendment will be deemed approved as of the 30th day after filing, unless the OCC notifies the filer that the amendment is denied or that the amendment contains procedures of the type described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B) of this section and is not subject to expedited review, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter in adopting the amendment.

(B) *Amendments exempted from expedited review.* Expedited review is not available for a charter amendment that would render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a block of the association's stock, the removal of incumbent management, or involve a significant issue of law or policy.

(ii) *Notice requirement.* No application under paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is required if the amendment is contained within paragraphs (e) or (g) of this section. In such case, the Federal stock savings association must submit a notice with the charter amendment to the OCC within 30 days after adoption.

(3) *Effectiveness.* A charter amendment is effective after approval by the OCC, if required, and adoption by the association, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter in adopting the amendments.

(g) *Optional charter amendments.* The following charter amendments are subject to the notice requirement in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section if adopted without change:

(1) *Title change.* A Federal stock association that complies with § 5.42 of this chapter may amend its charter by substituting a new corporate title in section 1.

(2) *Home office.* A Federal savings association may amend its charter by substituting a new home office in section 2, if it has complied with applicable requirements of § 5.40.

(3) *Number of shares of stock and par value.* A Federal stock association may amend Section 5 of its charter to change the number of authorized shares of stock, the number of shares within each class of stock, and the par or stated value of such shares.

(4) *Capital stock.* A Federal stock association may amend its charter by revising Section 5 to read as follows:

*Section 5. Capital stock.* The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the association has the authority to issue is \_\_\_\_, of which \_\_\_\_is common stock of par [or if no par value is specified the stated] value of \_\_\_\_per share and of which [list the number of each class of preferred and the par or if no par value is specified the stated value per share of each such class]. The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors without further approval of shareholders, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares must be paid in full before their issuance and may not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor future services may constitute payment or part payment for the issuance of shares of the association. The consideration for the shares must be cash, tangible or intangible property (to the extent direct investment in such property would be permitted), labor, or services actually performed for the association, or any combination of the foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the value of such property, labor, or services, as determined by the board of directors of the association, will be conclusive. Upon payment of such consideration, such shares will be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the retained earnings of the association that is transferred to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend will be deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.

Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the association or in connection with the conversion of the association from the mutual to the stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities) may be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or controlling persons of the association other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, unless their issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting.

Nothing contained in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections hereto) entitles the holders of any class of a series of capital stock to vote as a separate class or series or to more than one vote per share, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there will be no such cumulative voting: *Provided,* That this restriction on voting separately by class or series does not apply:

i. To any provision which would authorize the holders of preferred stock, voting as a class or series, to elect some members of the board of directors, less than a majority thereof, in the event of default in the payment of dividends on any class or series of preferred stock;

ii. To any provision that would require the holders of preferred stock, voting as a class or series, to approve the merger or consolidation of the association with another corporation or the sale, lease, or conveyance (other than by mortgage or pledge) of properties or business in exchange for securities of a corporation other than the association if the preferred stock is exchanged for securities of such other corporation: *Provided,* That no provision may require such approval for transactions undertaken with the assistance or pursuant to the direction of the OCC or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;

iii. To any amendment which would adversely change the specific terms of any class or series of capital stock as set forth in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections hereto), including any amendment which would create or enlarge any class or series ranking prior thereto in rights and preferences. An amendment which increases the number of authorized shares of any class or series of capital stock, or substitutes the surviving association in a merger or consolidation for the association, is not considered to be such an adverse change.

A description of the different classes and series (if any) of the association's capital stock and a statement of the designations, and the relative rights, preferences, and limitations of the shares of each class of and series (if any) of capital stock are as follows:

A. *Common stock.* Except as provided in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections thereto) the holders of the common stock exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of the common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held by each holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there will be no such cumulative voting.

Whenever there has been paid, or declared and set aside for payment, to the holders of the outstanding shares of any class of stock having preference over the common stock as to the payment of dividends, the full amount of dividends and of sinking fund, retirement fund, or other retirement payments, if any, to which such holders are respectively entitled in preference to the common stock, then dividends may be paid on the common stock and on any class or series of stock entitled to participate therewith as to dividends out of any assets legally available for the payment of dividends.

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association, the holders of the common stock (and the holders of any class or series of stock entitled to participate with the common stock in the distribution of assets) will be entitled to receive, in cash or in kind, the assets of the association available for distribution remaining after: (i) Payment or provision for payment of the association's debts and liabilities; (ii) distributions or provision for distributions in settlement of its liquidation account; and (iii) distributions or provision for distributions to holders of any class or series of stock having preference over the common stock in the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association. Each share of common stock will have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.

B. *Preferred stock.* The association may provide in supplementary sections to its charter for one or more classes of preferred stock, which must be separately identified. The shares of any class may be divided into and issued in series, with each series separately designated so as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes. The terms of each series must be set forth in a supplementary section to the charter. All shares of the same class must be identical except as to the following relative rights and preferences, as to which there may be variations between different series:

a. The distinctive serial designation and the number of shares constituting such series;

b. The dividend rate or the amount of dividends to be paid on the shares of such series, whether dividends are cumulative and, if so, from which date(s), the payment date(s) for dividends, and the participating or other special rights, if any, with respect to dividends;

c. The voting powers, full or limited, if any, of shares of such series;

d. Whether the shares of such series are redeemable and, if so, the price(s) at which, and the terms and conditions on which, such shares may be redeemed;

e. The amount(s) payable upon the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association;

f. Whether the shares of such series are entitled to the benefit of a sinking or retirement fund to be applied to the purchase or redemption of such shares, and if so entitled, the amount of such fund and the manner of its application, including the price(s) at which such shares may be redeemed or purchased through the application of such fund;

g. Whether the shares of such series are convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock of the association and, if so, the conversion price(s) or the rate(s) of exchange, and the adjustments thereof, if any, at which such conversion or exchange may be made, and any other terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange.

h. The price or other consideration for which the shares of such series are issued; and

i. Whether the shares of such series which are redeemed or converted have the status of authorized but unissued shares of serial preferred stock and whether such shares may be reissued as shares of the same or any other series of serial preferred stock.

Each share of each series of serial preferred stock must have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of the same series.

The board of directors has authority to divide, by the adoption of supplementary charter sections, any authorized class of preferred stock into series, and, within the limitations set forth in this section and the remainder of this charter, fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so established.

Prior to the issuance of any preferred shares of a series established by a supplementary charter section adopted by the board of directors, the association must file with the OCC a dated copy of that supplementary section of this charter established and designating the series and fixing and determining the relative rights and preferences thereof.

(5) *Limitations on subsequent issuances.* A Federal stock association may amend its charter to require shareholder approval of the issuance or reservation of common stock or securities convertible into common stock under circumstances which would require shareholder approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange if the shares were then listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

(6) *Cumulative voting.* A Federal stock association may amend its charter by substituting the following sentence for the second sentence in the third paragraph of Section 5: “Each holder of shares of common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder and there will be no right to cumulate votes in an election of directors.”

(7) *Anti-takeover provisions following mutual to stock conversion.* Notwithstanding the law of the State in which the association is located, a Federal stock association may amend its charter by renumbering existing sections as appropriate and adding a new section 8 as follows:

*Section 8. Certain Provisions Applicable for Five Years.* Notwithstanding anything contained in the Association's charter or bylaws to the contrary, for a period of [specify number of years up to five] years from the date of completion of the conversion of the Association from mutual to stock form, the following provisions will apply:

A. *Beneficial Ownership Limitation.* No person may directly or indirectly offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10 percent of any class of an equity security of the association. This limitation does not apply to a transaction in which the association forms a holding company without change in the respective beneficial ownership interests of its stockholders other than pursuant to the exercise of any dissenter and appraisal rights, the purchase of shares by underwriters in connection with a public offering, or the purchase of less than 25 percent of a class of stock by a tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan as defined in 12 CFR 192.25.

In the event shares are acquired in violation of this section 8, all shares beneficially owned by any person in excess of 10 percent will be considered “excess shares” and will not be counted as shares entitled to vote and may not be voted by any person or counted as voting shares in connection with any matters submitted to the stockholders for a vote.

For purposes of this section 8, the following definitions apply:

1. The term “person” includes an individual, a group acting in concert, a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint stock company, a trust, an unincorporated organization or similar company, a syndicate or any other group formed for the purpose of acquiring, holding or disposing of the equity securities of the association.

2. The term “offer” includes every offer to buy or otherwise acquire, solicitation of an offer to sell, tender offer for, or request or invitation for tenders of, a security or interest in a security for value.

3. The term “acquire” includes every type of acquisition, whether effected by purchase, exchange, operation of law or otherwise.

4. The term “acting in concert” means (a) knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards a common goal of acquiring control whether or not pursuant to an express agreement, or (b) a combination or pooling of voting or other interests in the securities of an issuer for a common purpose pursuant to any contract, understanding, relationship, agreement or other arrangement, whether written or otherwise.

B. *Cumulative Voting Limitation.* Stockholders may not cumulate their votes for election of directors.

C. *Call for Special Meetings.* Special meetings of stockholders relating to changes in control of the association or amendments to its charter may be called only upon direction of the board of directors.

(h) *Anti-takeover provisions.* The OCC may grant approval to a charter amendment not listed in paragraph (g) of this section regarding the acquisition by any person or persons of its equity securities provided that the association files as part of its application pursuant to paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section an opinion, acceptable to the OCC, of counsel independent from the association that the proposed charter provision would be permitted to be adopted by a corporation chartered by the State in which the principal office of the association is located. Any such provision must be consistent with applicable statutes, regulations, and OCC policies. Further, any such provision that would have the effect of rendering more difficult a change in control of the association and would require for any corporate action (other than the removal of directors) the affirmative vote of a larger percentage of shareholders than is required by this part, may not be effective unless adopted by a percentage of shareholder vote at least equal to the highest percentage that would be required to take any action under such provision.

(i) *Reissuance of charter.* A Federal stock association that has amended its charter may apply to have its charter, including the amendments, reissued by the OCC. Such requests for reissuance should be filed with the appropriate OCC licensing office, and contain signatures required in the form “Federal Stock Charter” in paragraph (e) of this section, together with such supporting documents as needed to demonstrate that the amendments were properly adopted.

(j) *Bylaws for Federal stock savings associations*—(1) *In general.* Bylaws may be adopted, amended or repealed by either a majority of the votes cast by the shareholders at a legal meeting or a majority of the board of directors. A bylaw provision inconsistent with paragraph (k), (l), (m) or (n) of this section may be adopted only with the approval of the OCC.

(2) *Form of filing*—(i) *Application requirement.* Except as provided in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii) or (j)(2)(iii) of this section, a Federal stock savings association must file the proposed bylaw amendment with, and obtain the prior approval of, the OCC.

(A) *Expedited review.* Except as provided in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the bylaw amendment will be deemed approved as of the 30th day after filing, unless the OCC notifies the filer that the application is denied or that the amendment contains procedures of the type described in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section and is not eligible for expedited review, provided the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting the amendment.

(B) *Amendments exempted from expedited review.* Expedited review is not available for a bylaw amendment that would:

(*1*) Render more difficult or discourage a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of the association's stock, or the removal of incumbent management; or

(*2*) Be inconsistent with paragraphs (k) through (n) of this section, with applicable laws, rules, regulations or the association's charter or involve a significant issue of law or policy, including indemnification, conflicts of interest, and limitations on director or officer liability.

(ii) *Corporate governance election and notice requirement.* A Federal stock association may elect to follow the corporate governance provisions of: The laws of any State in which the home office or any branch of the association is located; the laws of any State in which a holding company of the association is incorporated or chartered; Delaware General Corporation law; or the Model Business Corporation Act, provided that such provisions may be elected to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Federal statutes and regulations and safety and soundness, and such provisions are not of the type described in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section. If this election is selected, a Federal stock association must designate in its bylaws the provision or provisions from the body or bodies of law selected for its corporate governance provisions, and must file a notice containing a copy of such bylaws, within 30 days after adoption. The notice must indicate, where not obvious, why the bylaw provisions meet the requirements stated in paragraph (j)(2)(i)(B) of this section. A Federal stock savings association that has elected to follow the corporate governance provisions of the law of the State in which its holding company is incorporated may continue to use those provisions even if the association is no longer controlled by that holding company.

(iii) *No filing required.* No filing is required for purposes of paragraph (j)(2) of this section if a bylaw amendment adopts the language of the OCC's model or optional bylaws without change.

(3) *Effectiveness.* A bylaw amendment is effective after approval by the OCC, if required, and adoption by the association, provided that the association follows the requirements of its charter and bylaws in adopting the amendment.

(4) *Effect of subsequent charter or bylaw change.* Notwithstanding any subsequent change to its charter or bylaws, the authority of a Federal savings association to engage in any transaction is determined only by the association's charter or bylaws then in effect.

(k) *Shareholders of Federal stock savings associations*—(1) *Shareholder meetings*—(i) *In general.* A meeting of the shareholders of the association for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business of the association must be held annually within 150 days after the end of the association's fiscal year. Unless otherwise provided in the association's charter, special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the board of directors or on the request of the holders of 10 percent or more of the shares entitled to vote at the meeting, or by such other persons as may be specified in the bylaws of the association.

(ii) *Location of shareholder meetings*—(A) *In general.* All annual and special meetings of shareholders of the association may be held at any convenient place the board of directors may designate. The association's bylaws may provide for the telephonic or electronic participation of shareholders in these meetings. Shareholders participating in an annual or special meeting telephonically or electronically will be deemed present in person for purposes of the quorum requirement in paragraph (k)(5) of this section.

(B) *Procedures for telephonic or electronic participation.* If the association's bylaws provide for telephonic or electronic participation in shareholder meetings, the association must elect to follow corporate governance provisions for these meetings pursuant to paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section that include procedures for telephonic or electronic participation in shareholder meetings. The association must indicate the use of these elected procedures in its bylaws.

(2) *Notice of shareholder meetings.* Written notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting and the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called must be delivered not fewer than 20 nor more than 50 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the chair of the board, the president, the secretary, or the directors, or other persons calling the meeting, to each shareholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, such notice will be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the mail, addressed to the shareholder at the address appearing on the stock transfer books or records of the association as of the record date prescribed in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, with postage thereon prepaid. When any shareholders' meeting, either annual or special, is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjourned meeting must be given as in the case of an original meeting. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned is not subject to the shareholder notice requirement.

(3) *Fixing of record date.* For the purpose of determining shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of shareholders or any adjournment thereof, or shareholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of shareholders for any other proper purpose, the board of directors must fix in advance a date as the record date for any such determination of shareholders. Such date in any case may not be more than 60 days and, in case of a meeting of shareholders, not less than 10 days prior to the date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of shareholders, is to be taken. When a determination of shareholders entitled to vote at any meeting of shareholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination will apply to any adjournment thereof.

(4) *Voting lists.* (i) At least 20 days before each meeting of the shareholders, the officer or agent having charge of the stock transfer books for the shares of the association must make a complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting, or any adjournments thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address and the number of shares held by each. This list of shareholders must be kept on file at the home office of the association and is subject to inspection by any shareholder of record or the stockholder's agent during the entire time of the meeting. The original stock transfer book will constitute *prima facie* evidence of the stockholders entitled to examine such list or transfer books or to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Notwithstanding anything in this section, however, a Federal stock association that is wholly owned is not subject to the voting list requirements.

(ii) In lieu of making the shareholders list available for inspection by any shareholders as provided in paragraph (k)(4)(i) of this section, the board of directors may perform such acts as required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 14a-7 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR 240.14a-7) as may be duly requested in writing, with respect to any matter which may be properly considered at a meeting of shareholders, by any shareholder who is entitled to vote on such matter and who must defray the reasonable expenses to be incurred by the association in performance of the act or acts required.

(5) *Shareholder quorum.* A majority of the outstanding shares of the association entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum at a meeting of shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly organized meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum. If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter will be the act of the stockholders, unless the vote of a greater number of stockholders voting together or voting by classes is required by law or the charter. Directors, however, are elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an election of directors.

(6) *Shareholder voting*—(i) *Proxies.* Unless otherwise provided in the association's charter, at all meetings of shareholders, a shareholder may vote in person or by proxy executed in writing by the shareholder or by a duly authorized attorney in fact. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the shareholder. Proxies solicited on behalf of the management must be voted as directed by the shareholder or, in the absence of such direction, as determined by a majority of the board of directors. No proxy maybe valid more than eleven months from the date of its execution except for a proxy coupled with an interest.

(ii) *Shares controlled by association.* Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the association nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the association, may be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting.

(7) *Nominations and new business submitted by shareholders.* Nominations for directors and new business submitted by shareholders must be voted upon at the annual meeting if such nominations or new business are submitted in writing and delivered to the secretary of the association at least five days prior to the date of the annual meeting. Ballots bearing the names of all the persons nominated must be provided for use at the annual meeting.

(8) *Informal action by stockholders.* If the bylaws of the association so provide, any action required to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, or any other action that may be taken at a meeting of the stockholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing has been given by all the stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.

(l) *Board of directors*—(1) *General powers and duties.* The business and affairs of the association must be under the direction of its board of directors. Directors need not be stockholders unless the bylaws so require.

(2) *Number and term.* The bylaws must set forth a specific number of directors, not a range. The number of directors may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen, unless a higher or lower number has been authorized by the OTS prior to July 21, 2011 or the OCC. Directors must be elected for a term of one to three years and until their successors are elected and qualified. If a staggered board is chosen, the directors must be divided into two or three classes as nearly equal in number as possible and one class must be elected by ballot annually.

(3) *Regular meetings.* The board of directors determines the place, frequency, time and procedure for notice of regular meetings. The bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation at these meetings.

(4) *Quorum.* A majority of the number of directors constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors. The act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present will be the act of the board of directors, unless a greater number is prescribed by regulation of the OCC.

(5) *Vacancies.* Any vacancy occurring in the board of directors may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors even with less than a quorum of the board of directors. A director elected to fill a vacancy may serve only until the next election of directors by the shareholders. Any directorship to be filled by reason of an increase in the number of directors may be filled by election by the board of directors for a term of office continuing only until the next election of directors by the shareholders.

(6) *Removal or resignation of directors.* (i) At a meeting of shareholders called expressly for that purpose, any director may be removed only for cause, as termination for cause is defined in § 5.21(j)(2)(x)(B), by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Associations may provide for procedures regarding resignations in the bylaws.

(ii) If less than the entire board is to be removed, no one of the directors may be removed if the votes cast against the removal would be sufficient to elect a director if then cumulatively voted at an election of the class of directors of which such director is a part.

(iii) Whenever the holders of the shares of any class are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of the charter or supplemental sections thereto, the provisions of this section apply, in respect to the removal of a director or directors so elected, to the vote of the holders of the outstanding shares of that class and not to the vote of the outstanding shares as a whole.

(7) *Executive and other committees.* The board of directors, by resolution adopted by a majority of the full board, may designate from among its members an executive committee and one or more other committees. No committee may have the authority of the board of directors with reference to: The declaration of dividends; the amendment of the charter or bylaws of the association; recommending to the stockholders a plan of merger, consolidation, or conversion; the sale, lease, or other disposition of all, or substantially all, of the property and assets of the association otherwise than in the usual and regular course of its business; a voluntary dissolution of the association; a revocation of any of the foregoing; or the approval of a transaction in which any member of the executive committee, directly or indirectly, has any material beneficial interest. The designation of any committee and the delegation of authority thereto does not operate to relieve the board of directors, or any director, of any responsibility imposed by law or regulation.

(8) *Notice of special meetings.* Written notice of at least 24 hours regarding any special meeting of the board of directors or of any committee designated thereby must be given to each director in accordance with the bylaws, although such notice may be waived by the director. The attendance of a director at a meeting constitutes a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting need be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting. The bylaws may provide for telephonic or electronic participation at a special meeting.

(9) *Action without a meeting.* Any action required or permitted to be taken by the board of directors at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the actions so taken, is signed by all of the directors.

(10) *Presumption of assent.* A director of the association who is present at a meeting of the board of directors at which action on any association matter is taken is presumed to have assented to the action taken unless their dissent or abstention is entered in the minutes of the meeting or unless a written dissent to such action is filed with the person acting as the secretary of the meeting before the adjournment thereof or is forwarded by registered mail to the secretary of the association within five days after the date on which a copy of the minutes of the meeting is received. Such right to dissent does not apply to a director who voted in favor of such action.

(11) *Age limitation on directors.* A Federal association may provide a bylaw on age limitation for directors. Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, rules and regulations.

(m) *Officers*—(1) *Positions.* The officers of the association must consist of a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or comptroller, each of whom must be elected by the board of directors. The board of directors may also designate the chair of the board as an officer. The offices of the secretary and treasurer or comptroller may be held by the same person and the vice president may also be either the secretary or the treasurer or comptroller. The board of directors may designate one or more vice presidents as executive vice president or senior vice president.

(2) *Removal.* Any officer may be removed by the board of directors whenever in its judgment the best interests of the association will be served thereby; but such removal, other than for cause, as termination for cause is defined in § 5.21(j)(2)(x)(B), will be without prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed.

(3) *Age limitation on officers.* A Federal association may provide a bylaw on age limitation for officers. Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, rules, and regulations.

(n) *Certificates for shares and their transfer*—(1) *Certificates for shares.* Certificates representing shares of capital stock of the association must be in such form as determined by the board of directors and approved by the OCC. The name and address of the person to whom the shares are issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, must be entered on the stock transfer books of the association. All certificates surrendered to the association for transfer must be cancelled and no new certificate may be issued until the former certificate for a like number of shares has been surrendered and cancelled, except that in the case of a lost or destroyed certificate a new certificate may be issued upon such terms and indemnity to the association as the board of directors may prescribe.

(2) *Transfer of shares.* Transfer of shares of capital stock of the association may be made only on its stock transfer books. Authority for such transfer may be given only by the holder of record or by a legal representative, who must furnish proper evidence of such authority, or by an attorney authorized by a duly executed power of attorney and filed with the association. The transfer may be made only on surrender for cancellation of the certificate for the shares. The person in whose name shares of capital stock stand on the books of the association is deemed by the association to be the owner for all purposes.
