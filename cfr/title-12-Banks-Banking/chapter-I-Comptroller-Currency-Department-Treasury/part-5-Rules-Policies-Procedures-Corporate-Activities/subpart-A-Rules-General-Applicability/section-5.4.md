##### ยง 5.4 Filing required. #####

(a) *Filing.* A depository institution shall file an application or notice with the OCC to engage in corporate activities and transactions as described in this part.

(b) *Availability of forms.* Forms and instructions for filing are available on the OCC's Internet Web page at *www.occ.gov*.

(c) *Other agency's applications or filings.* At the request of the applicant, the OCC may accept an application or other filing submitted to another Federal agency that covers the proposed action or transaction and contains substantially the same information as required by the OCC. The OCC also may require the applicant to submit supplemental information.

(d) *Where to file.* An applicant should address a filing or other submission under this part to the appropriate OCC licensing office or appropriate OCC supervisory office, unless the OCC advises an applicant otherwise. Relevant addresses are listed on the OCC's Internet Web page at *www.occ.gov*.

(e) *Incorporation of other material.* An applicant may incorporate any material contained in any other application or filing filed with the OCC or other Federal agency by reference, provided that the material is attached to the application and is current and responsive to the information requested by the OCC. The filing must clearly indicate that the information is so incorporated and include a cross-reference to the information incorporated.

(f) *Prefiling meeting.* When submitting an application to the OCC, an applicant is encouraged to contact the appropriate OCC licensing office to determine the need for a prefiling meeting. The OCC decides whether to require a prefiling meeting on a case-by-case basis. Submission of a draft business plan or other relevant information before any prefiling meeting may expedite the filing review process. Information on model business plans can be found in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual.
