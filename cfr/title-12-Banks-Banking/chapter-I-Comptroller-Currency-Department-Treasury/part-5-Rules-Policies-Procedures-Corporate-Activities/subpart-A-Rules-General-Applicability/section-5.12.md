##### ยง 5.12 Computation of time. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 80436, Dec. 11, 2020.

In computing the period of days, the OCC does not include the day of the act or event (*e.g.,* the date an application is received by the OCC) from which the period begins to run. When the last day of a time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or Federal holiday.
