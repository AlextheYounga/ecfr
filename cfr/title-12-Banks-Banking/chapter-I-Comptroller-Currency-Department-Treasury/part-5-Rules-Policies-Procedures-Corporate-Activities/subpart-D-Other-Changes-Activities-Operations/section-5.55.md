Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 80466, Dec. 11, 2020.

(a) *Authority.* 12 U.S.C. 1462a, 1463, 1464, 1467a, 1831o, and 5412(b)(2)(B).

(b) *Licensing requirements.* A Federal savings association must file an application or notice before making a capital distribution, as provided in this section.

(c) *Scope.* This section applies to all capital distributions by a Federal savings association and sets forth the procedures and standards relating to a capital distribution.

(d) *Definitions.* The following definitions apply to this section:

(1) *Affiliate* means an affiliate, as defined under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System regarding transactions with affiliates, 12 CFR part 223 (Regulation W).

(2) *Capital* means total capital, as computed under 12 CFR part 3.

(3) *Capital distribution* means:

(i) A distribution of cash or other property to owners of a Federal savings association made on account of their ownership, but excludes:

(A) Any dividend consisting only of the shares of the savings association or rights to purchase the shares; or

(B) If the savings association is a Federal mutual savings association, any payment that the savings association is required to make under the terms of a deposit instrument and any other amount paid on deposits that the OCC determines is not a distribution for the purposes of this section;

(ii) A Federal savings association's payment to repurchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire any of its shares or other ownership interests; any payment to repurchase, redeem, retire, or otherwise acquire debt instruments included in its total capital under 12 CFR part 3; and any extension of credit to finance an affiliate's acquisition of the savings association's shares or interests;

(iii) Any direct or indirect payment of cash or other property to owners or affiliates made in connection with a corporate restructuring. This includes the Federal savings association's payment of cash or property to shareholders of another association or to shareholders of its holding company to acquire ownership in that association, other than by a distribution of shares;

(iv) Any other distribution charged against a Federal savings association's capital accounts if the savings association would not be well capitalized, as set forth in 12 CFR 6.4, following the distribution; and

(v) Any transaction that the OCC determines, by order or regulation, to be in substance a distribution of capital.

(4) *Net income* means a Federal savings association's net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

(5) *Retained net income* means a Federal savings association's net income for a specified period less total capital distributions declared in that period.

(6) *Shares* means common and preferred stock, and any options, warrants, or other rights for the acquisition of such stock. The term “share” also includes convertible securities upon their conversion into common or preferred stock. The term does not include convertible debt securities prior to their conversion into common or preferred stock or other securities that are not equity securities at the time of a capital distribution.

(e) *Filing requirements* - (1) *Application required.* A Federal savings association must file an application with the OCC if:

(i) The savings association is not an eligible savings association;

(ii) The total amount of all of the savings association's capital distributions (including the proposed capital distribution) for the applicable calendar year exceeds its net income for that year to date plus retained net income for the preceding two years;

(iii) The savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized, as set forth in 12 CFR 6.4, following the distribution; or

(iv) The savings association's proposed capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any applicable statute, regulation, or agreement between the savings association and the OCC or the OTS, or violate a condition imposed on the savings association in an application or notice approved by the OCC or the OTS.

(2) *Notice required.* Unless it is required to file an application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a Federal savings association that is an eligible savings association must file a notice with the OCC if:

(i) The savings association would not remain well capitalized, as set forth under 12 CFR 6.4, or would otherwise not remain an eligible savings association following the distribution;

(ii) The savings association's proposed capital distribution would reduce the amount of or retire any part of its common or preferred stock or retire any part of debt instruments such as notes or debentures included in capital under 12 CFR part 3 (other than regular payments required under a debt instrument approved under § 5.56);

(iii) The savings association's proposed capital distribution is payable in property other than cash;

(iv) The savings association is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a mutual savings and loan holding company; or

(v) The savings association is a direct or indirect subsidiary of a company that is not a savings and loan holding company.

(3) *No prior notice required.* A Federal savings association does not need to file a notice or an application with the OCC before making a capital distribution if the Federal savings association is not required to file an application under paragraph (e)(1) or a notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(4) *Informational copy of notice required.* If the Federal savings association is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company that is filing a notice with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) for a dividend solely under 12 U.S.C. 1467a(f) and not also under 12 U.S.C. 1467a(o)(11), and neither an application under paragraph (e)(1) nor a notice under paragraph (e)(2) of this section is required, then the savings association must provide an informational copy to the OCC of the notice filed with the Board, at the same time the notice is filed with the Board.

(f) *Filing format* - (1) *Contents.* The notice or application must:

(i) Be in narrative form;

(ii) Include all relevant information concerning the proposed capital distribution, including the amount, timing, and type of distribution; and

(iii) Demonstrate compliance with paragraph (h) of this section.

(2) *Schedules.* The notice or application may include a schedule proposing capital distributions over a specified period, not to exceed 12 months.

(3) *Combined filings.* A Federal savings association may combine the notice or application required under paragraph (e) of this section with any other notice or application, if the capital distribution is a part of, or is proposed in connection with, another transaction requiring a notice or application under this chapter. If submitting a combined filing, the Federal savings association must state that the related notice or application is intended to serve as a notice or application under this section.

(g) *Filing procedures* - (1) *Application.* When a Federal savings association is required to file an application under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, it must file the application at least 30 days before the proposed declaration of dividend or approval of the proposed capital distribution by its board of directors. The Federal savings association shall not effect the proposed declaration of dividend or approval of the proposed capital distribution unless it has received prior written approval of the OCC.

(2) *Prior notice with expedited review.* A Federal savings association that is an eligible savings association and that is required to file a notice under paragraph (e)(2) must file the notice at least 30 days before the proposed declaration of dividend or approval of the proposed capital distribution by its board of directors. The notice is deemed approved by the OCC upon the expiration of 30 days after the filing date of the notice unless, before the expiration of that time period, the OCC notifies the Federal savings association that:

(i) Additional information is required to supplement the notice;

(ii) The notice is not eligible for expedited review, or the expedited reviewed process is extended, under 5.13(a)(2); or

(iii) The notice is disapproved.

(h) *OCC review of capital distributions.* The OCC reviews applications and notices submitted pursuant to paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section. The OCC may disapprove the notice or deny the application in whole or in part, if it makes any of the following determinations:

(1) The Federal savings association will be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized as set forth in 12 CFR 6.4, as applicable, following the capital distribution. If so, the OCC will determine if the capital distribution is permitted under 12 U.S.C. 1831o(d)(1)(B).

(2) The proposed capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns.

(3) The proposed capital distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, agreement between the Federal savings association and the OCC or the OTS, or a condition imposed on the Federal savings association in an application or notice approved by the OCC or the OTS. If so, the OCC will determine whether it may permit the capital distribution notwithstanding the prohibition or condition.

(i) *Exceptions to rules of general applicability.* Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to capital distributions made by Federal savings associations.
