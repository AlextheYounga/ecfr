##### § 502.26 How does OTS calculate the semi-annual assessment for savings and loan holding companies? #####

(a) OTS calculates the semi-annual assessment savings and loan holding companies as follows:

(1) OTS will assess a base assessment amount of $3,500 on responsible savings and loan holding companies. The base assessment amount reflects OTS's estimate of the base costs of conducting on- and off-site supervision of a noncomplex, low risk savings and loan holding company structure. OTS will periodically revise this amount to reflect changes in inflation based on a readily available index. OTS will establish the revised amount of the base assessment in a Thrift Bulletin.

(2) OTS will add three components to the base assessment amount to compute the amount of the semi-annual assessment for responsible savings and loan holding companies: a component based on the risk or complexity of the savings and loan holding company's business, a component based on its organizational form, and a component based on its condition. OTS determines the amount of each component under §§ 502.27 through 502.29 of this part.

(b) For purposes of the semi-annual assessment of savings and loan holding companies:

(1) The *responsible holding company* is the registered holding company at the highest level of ownership in a holding company structure, unless OTS designates another savings and loan holding company in the holding company structure. OTS may designate an intermediate-tier holding company if the assessment of this entity would more accurately reflect OTS costs of supervising the holding company structure and:

(i) There are multiple top-tier holding companies in the holding company structure;

(ii) The top-tier holding company is organized outside of the United States, and is subject to the consolidated review of a foreign regulator; or

(iii) Other circumstances indicate that the assessment of the top-tier holding company is inappropriate.

(2) *Total consolidated holding company assets* are the total assets as reported on the Thrift Financial Report, Schedule HC. If Schedule HC is unavailable, OTS will use total assets reported on report H-(b)11. OTS uses information contained in the September 30 Schedule HC or report H-(b)11 to determine amounts due at the January 31 assessment; and the March 31 Schedule HC or report H-(b)11 to determine amounts due at the July 31 assessment.
