##### ยง 502.15 How does OTS determine my size component? #####

(a) *Chart.* If you are a savings association, OTS uses the following chart to calculate your size component:

|If your total assets are: . . .|Your size component is:|                                    |                    |                            |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|
|           Over - \*           |    But not over -     |This amount - Base assessment amount|Plus - Marginal rate|Of assets over - Class floor|

|               0               |      $67 million      |                 C1                 |         D1         |             0.             |
|          $67 million          |      215 million      |                 C2                 |         D2         |        $67 million.        |
|          215 million          |       1 billion       |                 C3                 |         D3         |        215 million.        |

|         6.03 billion          |      18 billion       |                 C5                 |         D5         |       6.03 billion.        |
|          18 billion           |      35 billion       |                 C6                 |         D6         |        18 billion.         |
|          35 billion           |                       |                 C7                 |         D7         |        35 billion.         |

(b) *Calculation.* To calculate your size component, find the row in Columns A and B that describes your total assets. Reading across in that same row, find your base assessment amount in Column C, your marginal rate in Column D, and your class floor in Column E. Calculate how much your total assets exceed your Column E class floor. Multiply this number by your Column D marginal rate. Add this number to your Column C base assessment amount. The total is your size component. OTS will establish the base assessment amounts and the marginal rates in columns C and D in a Thrift Bulletin.
