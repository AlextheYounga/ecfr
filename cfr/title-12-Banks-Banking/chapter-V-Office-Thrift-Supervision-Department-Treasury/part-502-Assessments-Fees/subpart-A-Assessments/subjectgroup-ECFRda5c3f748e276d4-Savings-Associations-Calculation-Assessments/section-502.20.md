##### ยง 502.20 How does OTS determine my condition component? #####

(a) If you are a savings association, OTS uses the following chart to determine your condition component:

|If your composite  <br/>rating is:| Then your condition component is: |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|              1 or 2              |               Zero.               |
|                3                 |50 percent of your size component. |
|              4 or 5              |100 percent of your size component.|

(b) For the purposes of this section, OTS uses the most recent composite rating, as defined in 12 CFR part 516, of which you have been notified in writing before an assessment's due date.
