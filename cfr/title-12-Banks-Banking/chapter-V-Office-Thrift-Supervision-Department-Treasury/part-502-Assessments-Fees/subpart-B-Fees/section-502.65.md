##### ยง 502.65 When is an application fee due? #####

(a) You must pay the application fee when you file an application. OTS will not process your application if you do not include the required fee.

(b) If OTS cannot complete its review of your application because the application is materially deficient and it refuses to accept your application for processing, you must pay a new application fee upon filing a revised application.

(c) If a transaction involves multiple applications, you must pay the appropriate fee for each application, unless OTS specifies otherwise by Thrift Bulletin.
