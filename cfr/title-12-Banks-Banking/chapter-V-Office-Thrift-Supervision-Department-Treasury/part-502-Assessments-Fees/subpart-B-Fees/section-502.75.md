##### ยง 502.75 What if I do not pay my fees on time? #####

(a) *Interest.* An examination or investigation fee is delinquent if OTS does not receive the fee within 30 days of the date specified in a bill. The Director will charge interest on a delinquent examination or investigation fee. Interest will accrue at a rate (that OTS will determine quarterly) equal to 150 percent of the average of the bond-equivalent rates of 13-week Treasury bills auctioned during the preceding calendar quarter.

(b) *Failure to pay.* If you are a savings association and your holding company, affiliate, or subsidiary fails to pay any fee within 60 days of the date specified in a bill, the Director may assess and collect that fee, with interest, from you. If the holding company, affiliate, or subsidiary is related to more than one savings association, the Director may assess the fee against and collect it from each savings association as the Director may prescribe.
