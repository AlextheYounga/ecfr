##### ยง 502.60 When will OTS adjust, add, waive, or eliminate a fee? #####

Under unusual circumstances, the Director may deem it necessary or appropriate to adjust, add, waive, or eliminate a fee. For example, the Director may:

(a) Reduce any fee to adjust for any inequities, efficiencies, or changed procedures that OTS projects will reduce its applications processing costs but that OTS did not consider in determining its fees;

(b) Reduce or waive any fee if OTS determines that the fee would unduly or unjustifiably discourage particular types of applications or applications for particular categories of transactions;

(c) Add a fee for a new type of application;

(d) Increase a fee for an application that presents unusual or particularly complex issues of law or policy or otherwise causes the agency to incur unusually high processing costs; or

(e) Charge a fee to recover extraordinary expenses related to examination, investigation, regulation, or supervision of savings associations or their affiliates.
