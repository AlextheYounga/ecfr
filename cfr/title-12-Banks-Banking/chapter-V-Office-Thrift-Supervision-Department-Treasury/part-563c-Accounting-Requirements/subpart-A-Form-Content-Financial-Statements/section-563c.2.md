(1) The association's and its other subsidiaries' investments in and advances to the subsidiary exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the association and its subsidiaries consolidated as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year (for purposes of determining whether financial statements of a business acquired or to be acquired in a business combination accounted for as a pooling of interests are required pursuant to 17 CFR 210.3-05, this condition is also met when the number of common shares exchanged by the association exceeds 10 percent of its total common shares outstanding at the date the combination is initiated); or

(3) The association's and its other subsidiaries' equity in the income from continuing operations before income taxes, extraordinary items, and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of the subsidiary exceeds 10 percent of such income of the association and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recently completed fiscal year.

Computational note:

For purposes of making the prescribed income test the following guidance should be applied:

1. When a loss has been incurred by either the parent or its consolidated subsidiaries or the tested subsidiary, but not both, the equity in the income or loss of the tested subsidiary should be excluded from the income of the association and its subsidiaries consolidated for purposes of the computation.

2. If income of the association and its subsidiaries consolidated for the most recent fiscal year is at least 10 percent lower than the average of the income for the last five fiscal years, such average income should be substituted for purposes of the computation. Any loss years should be omitted for purposes of computing average income.
