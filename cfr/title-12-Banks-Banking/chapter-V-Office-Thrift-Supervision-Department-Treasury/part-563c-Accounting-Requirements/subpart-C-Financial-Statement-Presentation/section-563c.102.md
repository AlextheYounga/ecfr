This section specifies the various line items which should appear on the face of the financial statements governed by this subpart C and additional disclosures which should be included with the financial statements in related notes.

I. Balance Sheet

Balance sheets shall comply with the following provisions:

Assets

1. *Cash and amounts due from depository institutions.* (a) The amounts in this caption should include noninterest-bearing deposits with depository institutions.

(b) State in a note the amount and terms of any deposits in depository institutions held as compensating balances against long- or short-term borrowing arrangements. This disclosure should include the provisions of any restrictions as to withdrawal or usage. Restrictions may include legally restricted deposits held as compensating balances against short-term borrowing arrangements, contracts entered into with others, or company statements of intention with regard to particular deposits; however, time deposits and short-term certificates of deposits are not generally included in legally restricted deposits. In cases where compensating balance arrangements exist but are not agreements which legally restrict the use of cash amounts shown on the balance sheet, describe in the notes to the financial statements these arrangements and the amount involved, if determinable, for the most recent audited balance sheet required and for any subsequent unaudited balance sheet required. Compensating balances that are maintained under an agreement to ensure future credit availability shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements along with the amount and terms of the agreement.

(c) Checks outstanding in excess of an applicant's book balance in a demand deposit account shall be shown as a liability.

2. *Interest-bearing deposits in other banks.*

Borrowed securities and securities purchased under resale agreements or similar arrangements should be excluded.

In addition, the association shall disclose the net effect on net income before taxes of the amortization and accretion of discounts, premiums, and intangible assets related to prior business combinations accounted for by the purchase method of accounting. Such disclosures need not be made if the total amounts of discounts, premiums, or intangible assets do not exceed 30 percent of stockholders' equity as of the date of the most recent balance sheet presented.

[Association may determine disclosure based on information provided in footnotes below]

(a) Provide condensed financial information as to financial position, changes in financial position, and results of operations of the association as of the same dates and for the same periods for which audited consolidated financial statements are required. The financial information required need not be presented in greater detail than is required for condensed statement by 17 CFR 210.10-01(a) (2), (3), (4). Detailed footnote disclosure which would normally be included with complete financial statements may be omitted with the exception of disclosure regarding material contingencies, long-term obligations, and guarantees. Description of significant provisions of the association's long-term obligations, mandatory dividend, or redemption requirements of redeemable stocks, and guarantees of the association shall be provided along with a 5-year schedule of maturities of debt. If the material contingencies, long-term obligations, redeemable stock requirements, and guarantees of the association have been separately disclosed in the consolidated statements, they need not be repeated in this schedule.

(b) Disclose separately the amount of cash dividends paid to the association for each of the last three fiscal years by consolidated subsidiaries, unconsolidated subsidiaries, and 50-percent- or less-owned persons accounted for by the equity method, respectively.
