##### § 509.28 Interlocutory review. #####

(a) *General rule.* The Director may review a ruling of the administrative law judge prior to the certification of the record to the Director only in accordance with the procedures set forth in this section and § 509.23 of this subpart.

(b) *Scope of review.* The Director may exercise interlocutory review of a ruling of the administrative law judge if the Director finds that:

(1) The ruling involves a controlling question of law or policy as to which substantial grounds exist for a difference of opinion;

(2) Immediate review of the ruling may materially advance the ultimate termination of the proceeding;

(3) Subsequent modification of the ruling at the conclusion of the proceeding would be an inadequate remedy; or

(4) Subsequent modification of the ruling would cause unusual delay or expense.

(c) *Procedure.* Any request for interlocutory review shall be filed by a party with the administrative law judge within ten days of his or her ruling and shall otherwise comply with § 509.23 of this subpart. Any party may file a response to a request for interlocutory review in accordance with § 509.23(d) of this subpart. Upon the expiration of the time for filing all responses, the administrative law judge shall refer the matter to the Director for final disposition.

(d) *Suspension of proceeding.* Neither a request for interlocutory review nor any disposition of such a request by the Director under this section suspends or stays the proceeding unless otherwise ordered by the administrative law judge or the Director.
