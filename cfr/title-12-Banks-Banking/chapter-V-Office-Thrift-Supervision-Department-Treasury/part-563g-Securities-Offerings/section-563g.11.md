(b) When an offering circular or amendment has been on file with the Office for a period of nine months and has not become effective, the Office may, in its discretion, determine whether the filing has been abandoned, after notifying the issuer that the filing is out of date and must either be amended to comply with the applicable requirements of this part or be withdrawn within 30 days after the date of such notice. When a filing is abandoned, the filing will not be removed from the files of the Office, but will be marked “Declared abandoned by the Office on (date).”
