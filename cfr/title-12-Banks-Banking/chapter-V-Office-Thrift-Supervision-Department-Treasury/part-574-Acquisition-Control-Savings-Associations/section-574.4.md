(ii) That enables the acquiror to influence a material aspect of the management or policies of the savings association, other than agreements to which the savings association is a party where the restrictions are customary under the circumstances and in the case of an acquisition agreement, which apply only during the period when the acquiror is seeking the Office's approval to acquire the savings association, the agreement prohibits transactions between the acquiror and the savings association and their respective affiliates without approval by the Regional Director during the pendency of the application process, and the agreement contains no material forfeiture provisions applicable to the savings association in the event the acquisition is not approved or not approved by a specified date.

(6) The acquiror would have the power to direct the disposition of more than 25 percent of a class of the savings association's voting stock in a manner other than a widely dispersed or public offering.

(6) A person or company will be presumed to be acting in concert with any trust for which such person or company serves as trustee, except that a tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan as defined in § 563b.2(a)(39) shall not be presumed to be acting in concert with its trustee or person acting in a similar fiduciary capacity solely for the purposes of determining whether to combine the holdings of a plan and its trustee or fiduciary.

(7) Persons or companies will be presumed to be acting in concert with each other and with any other person or company with which they also are presumed to act in concert.

(e) *Procedures for rebuttal* - (1) *Rebuttal of control determination.* An acquiror attempting to rebut a determination of control that would arise under paragraph (b) of this section shall file a submission with the Office setting forth the facts and circumstances which support the acquiror's contention that no control relationship would exist if the acquiror acquires stock or obtains a control factor with respect to a savings association. The rebuttal must be filed and accepted in accordance with this section before the acquiror acquires such stock or control factor.

(i) An acquiror seeking to rebut the determination of control arising under paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall submit to the Office an executed agreement materially conforming to the agreement set forth at § 574.100 of this part. Unless agreed to by the Office in writing, no other agreement or filing shall be deemed to rebut the determination of control arising under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If accepted by the Office, the acquiror shall furnish a copy of the executed agreement to the association to which the rebuttal pertains.

(ii) An acquiror seeking to rebut the determination of control with respect to holding of proxies arising under paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be subject to the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, except that in the case of a rebuttal of the presumption of control arising under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the Office may require the acquiror to furnish information in response to a specific request for information and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances, to provide an executed rebuttal agreement materially conforming to the agreement set forth at § 574.100 of this part, with any modifications deemed necessary by the Office.

(2) *Presumptions of concerted action.* An acquiror attempting to rebut the presumption of concerted action arising under paragraph (d) of this section shall file a submission with the Office setting forth facts and circumstances which clearly and convincingly demonstrate the acquiror's contention that no action in concert exists. Such a statement must be accompanied by an affidavit, in form and content satisfactory to the Office, executed by each person or company presumed to be acting in concert, stating that such person or company does not and shall not, without having made necessary filings and obtained approval or clearance thereof under the Holding Company Act or the Control Act, as applicable, have any agreements or understandings, written or tacit, with respect to the exercise of control, directly or indirectly, over the management or policies of the savings association, including agreements relating to voting, acquisition or disposition of the savings association's stock. The affidavit shall also recite that the signatory is aware that the filing of a false affidavit may subject the person or company to criminal sanctions, would constitute a violation of the Office's regulations at 12 CFR 563.180(b), and would be considered a “presumptive disqualifier” under 12 CFR 574.7(g)(1)(v).

(3) *Determination.* A rebuttal filed pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section shall not be deemed sufficient unless it includes all the information, agreements, and affidavits required by the Office and this part, as well as any additional relevant information as the Office may require by written request to the acquiror. Within 20 calendar days after proper filing of a rebuttal submission, the Office will provide written notification of its determination to accept or reject the submission; request additional information in connection with the submission; or return the submission to the acquiror as materially deficient. Within 15 calendar days after proper filing of any additional information furnished in response to a specific request by the Office, the Office shall notify the acquiror in writing as to whether the rebuttal is thereby deemed to be sufficient. If the Office fails to notify an acquiror within such time, the rebuttal shall be deemed to be accepted. The Office may reject any rebuttal which is inconsistent with facts and circumstances known to it or where the rebuttal does not clearly and convincingly refute the rebuttable determination of control or presumption of action in concert, and may determine to reject a submission solely on such bases.

(f) *Safe harbor.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where an acquiror has no intention to participate in or to seek to exercise control over a savings association's management or policies, the acquiror may seek to qualify for a safe harbor with respect to its ownership of stock of a savings association.

(1) In order to qualify for the safe harbor, an acquiror must submit a certification to the OTS that shall be signed by the acquiror or an authorized representative thereof and shall read as follows:

The undersigned makes this submission pursuant to § 574.4(f) of the regulations of the Office of Thrift Supervision (“Office”) with respect to [name of savings association] and hereby certifies to the Office the following:

The undersigned is not subject to any control factor as enumerated in § 574.4(c) with respect to the [name of savings association];

The undersigned has not acquired stock of [name of savings association] for the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of [name of savings association] or in connection with or as a participant in any transaction having such purpose or effect.
