##### § 574.3 Acquisition of control of savings associations. #####

(a) *Acquisition by a company or certain persons.* Unless a transaction is exempt under paragraph (c) of this section, or exempt from prior approval under paragraph (d) of this section, no company or any director or officer of a savings and loan holding company, or any individual who owns, controls, or holds with power to vote (or holds proxies representing) more than 25 percent of the voting stock of a savings and loan holding company, shall acquire control, as defined in § 574.4 (a) and (b) of this part, of a savings association except upon receipt of the written approval of the Office.

(b) *Acquisition by a person.* Unless a transaction is exempt under paragraph (c) of this section, or exempt from prior notice under paragraph (d) of this section, no person (other than certain persons affiliated with a savings and loan holding company who are subject to paragraph (a) of this section), shall acquire control, as defined in § 574.4 (a) and (b) of this part, of a savings association until written notice has been provided to the Office and (1) the Office indicates in writing its intent not to disapprove the proposed acquisition or (2) 60 days (or such period of time as the Office may specify if the review period has been extended under § 574.6(c)(3) of this part) have passed since receipt of a notice deemed sufficient under § 574.6(c)(2). Notwithstanding the forgoing, acquisitions by persons by means of a merger with an interim association are not subject to this part, but shall be subject to approval under § 563.22, and either § 552.13 or applicable state law.

(c) *Exempt transactions.* (1) The following transactions are exempt from the application requirements of paragraph (a) of this section:

(ii) Control of a savings association acquired in connection with a reorganization that involves solely the acquisition of control of that association by a newly formed company that is controlled by the same acquirors that controlled the savings association for the immediately preceding three years, and entails no other transactions, such as an assumption of the acquirors' debt by the newly formed company: Provided, that the acquirors have filed with the Office an H-(e)4 notification as provided in section 574.6 of this part and the OTS does not object to the acquisition within 30 days of the filing date;

(iv) Control of a savings association acquired solely as a result of (A) a pledge or hypothecation of stock to secure a loan contracted for in good faith or (B) the liquidation of a loan contracted for in good faith, in either case where such loan was made in the ordinary course of the business of the lender: *Provided, further,* That acquisition of control pursuant to such pledge, hypothecation or liquidation is reported to the Office within 30 days, and *Provided, further,* That the acquiror shall not retain such control for more than one year from the date on which such control was acquired; however, the Office may, upon application by an acquiror, extend such one-year period from year to year, for an additional period of time not exceeding three years, if the Office finds such extension is warranted and would not be detrimental to the public interest;

(v) Control of a savings association acquired through a percentage increase in stock ownership following a *pro rata* stock dividend or stock split, if the proportional interests of the recipients remain substantially the same;

(vi) Acquisition of additional stock after approval under § 574.7 of this part, or any predecessor provision, has been received: *Provided,* That such acquisition is consistent with any conditions imposed in connection with such approval and with the representations made by the acquiror in its application;

(ii) The acquiror shall not take any action to direct the management or policies of the savings association or which are designed to effect a change in the business plan of the savings association other than voting on matters that may be presented to stockholders by management of the savings association until the Office has acted favorably upon the acquiror's application or notice, and the Office may require that the acquiror take such steps as the Office deems necessary to insure that control is not exercised; and

(iii) If the Office disapproves the acquiror's application or notice, the acquiror shall divest such portion of the stock held by the acquiror so as to cause the acquiror not to be determined to be in control of the savings association under § 574.4 of this part, within one year or such shorter period of time and in the manner that the Office may order.

(e) *Prohibited acquisitions.* No acquisition shall be approved by the Office pursuant to § 574.3(a) which would result in the formation by any company, through one or more subsidiaries or through one or more transactions, of a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state where the acquisition causes a savings association to become an affiliate of another savings association with which it was not previously affiliated unless:

(1) Such company, or a savings association subsidiary of such company, is authorized to acquire control of a savings association subsidiary, or to operate a home or branch office, in the additional state or states pursuant to section 13(k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1823(k) (or section 408(m) of the National Housing Act as in effect immediately prior to enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989);

(2) Such company controls a savings association subsidiary which operated a home or branch office in the additional state or states as of March 5, 1987; or

(3) The statute laws of the state in which the savings association, control of which is to be acquired, is located are such that a savings association chartered by such state could be acquired by a savings association chartered by the state where the acquiring savings association or savings and loan holding company is located (or by a holding company that controls such a state chartered savings association), and such statute laws specifically authorize such an acquisition by language to that effect and not merely by implication.
