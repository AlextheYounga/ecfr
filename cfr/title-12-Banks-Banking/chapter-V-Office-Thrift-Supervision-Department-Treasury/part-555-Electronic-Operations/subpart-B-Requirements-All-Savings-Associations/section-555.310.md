(a) *Notice requirement.* You must file a written notice with the appropriate Regional Office listed at ยง 516.40(a) of this chapter at least 30 days before you establish a transactional website. The notice must do three things:

(1) Describe the transactional web site.

(2) Indicate the date the transactional web site will become operational.

(3) List a contact familiar with the deployment, operation, and security of the transactional web site.

(b) *Transition provision.* If you established a transactional web site after the date of your last regular onsite OTS safety and soundness examination but before January 1, 1999, you must file a notice describing your activity by February 1, 1999.
