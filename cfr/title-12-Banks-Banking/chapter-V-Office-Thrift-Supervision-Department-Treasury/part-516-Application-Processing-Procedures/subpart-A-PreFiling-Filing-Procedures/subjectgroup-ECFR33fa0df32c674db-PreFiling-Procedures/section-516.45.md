(1) You attend a pre-filing meeting and submit a draft business plan or relevant information, if OTS requires you to do so under § 516.15.

(2) You file your application and all required copies with OTS, as described under § 516.40.

(i) If you are required to file with a Regional Office and with OTS Headquarters, you have not filed with OTS until you file with both offices.

(ii) You have not filed with a Regional Office or OTS Headquarters until you file the application and the required number of copies with that office.

(iii) If you file after the close of business established by a Regional Office or OTS Headquarters, you have filed with that office on the next business day.

(3) You pay the applicable fee. You have not paid the fee until you submit the fee to the appropriate Regional Office, or OTS waives the fee. You may pay by check, money order, cashier's check or wire transfer payable to OTS.

(b) OTS may notify you that it has adjusted your application filing date if you fail to meet any applicable publication requirements.
