##### § 516.25 What type of application must I file? #####

(a) *Expedited treatment.* If you are eligible for expedited treatment under § 516.5, you may file your application in the form of a notice that includes all information required by the applicable substantive regulation.

(c) *Waiver requests.* If you want OTS to waive a requirement that you provide certain information with the notice or application, you must include a written waiver request:

(1) Describing the requirement to be waived and

(2) Explaining why the information is not needed to enable OTS to evaluate your notice or application under applicable standards.
