##### ยง 516.10 How does OTS compute time periods under this part? #####

In computing time periods under this part, OTS does not include the day of the act or event that commences the time period. When the last day of a time period is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.
