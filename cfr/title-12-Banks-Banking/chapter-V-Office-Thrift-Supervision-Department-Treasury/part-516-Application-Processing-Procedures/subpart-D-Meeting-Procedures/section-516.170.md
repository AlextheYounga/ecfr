##### ยง 516.170 When will OTS conduct a meeting on an application? #####

(a) OTS will grant a meeting request or conduct a meeting on its own initiative, if it finds that written submissions are insufficient to address facts or issues raised in an application, or otherwise determines that a meeting will benefit the decision-making process. OTS may limit the issues considered at the meeting to issues that OTS decides are relevant or material.

(b) OTS will inform the applicant and all commenters requesting a meeting of its decision to grant or deny a meeting request, or of its decision to conduct a meeting on its own initiative.

(c) If OTS decides to conduct a meeting, OTS will invite the applicant and any commenters requesting a meeting and raising an issue that OTS intends to consider at the meeting. OTS may also invite other interested persons to attend. OTS will inform the participants of the date, time, location, issues to be considered, and format for the meeting a reasonable time before the meeting.
