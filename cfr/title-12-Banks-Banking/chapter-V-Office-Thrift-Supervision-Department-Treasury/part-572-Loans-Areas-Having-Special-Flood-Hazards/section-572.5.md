##### ยง 572.5 Escrow requirement. #####

If a savings association requires the escrow of taxes, insurance premiums, fees, or any other charges for a loan secured by *residential* improved real estate or a mobile home that is made, increased, extended, or renewed on or after October 1, 1996, the savings association shall also require the escrow of all premiums and fees for any flood insurance required under ยง 572.3. The savings association, or a servicer acting on behalf of the savings association, shall deposit the flood insurance premiums on behalf of the borrower in an escrow account. This escrow account will be subject to escrow requirements adopted pursuant to section 10 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 U.S.C. 2609) (RESPA), which generally limits the amount that may be maintained in escrow accounts for certain types of loans and requires escrow account statements for those accounts, only if the loan is otherwise subject to RESPA. Following receipt of a notice from the Director of FEMA or other provider of flood insurance that premiums are due, the savings association, or a servicer acting on behalf of the savings association, shall pay the amount owed to the insurance provider from the escrow account by the date when such premiums are due.
