##### § 563b.225 Must I submit the plan of conversion to my members for approval? #####

(a) After OTS approves your plan of conversion, you must submit your plan of conversion to your members for approval. You must obtain this approval at a meeting of your members, which may be a special or annual meeting, unless you are a state-chartered savings association and state law requires you to obtain approval at an annual meeting.

(b) Your members must approve your plan of conversion by a majority of the total outstanding votes, unless you are a state-chartered savings association and state law prescribes a higher percentage.

(c) Your members may vote in person or by proxy.

(d) You may notify eligible account holders or supplemental eligible account holders who are not voting members of your proposed conversion. You may include only the information in § 563b.135 in your notice.
