##### § 563b.525 Who may acquire my shares after I convert? #####

(a) For three years after you convert, no person may, directly or indirectly, acquire or offer to acquire the beneficial ownership of more than ten percent of any class of your equity securities without OTS's prior written approval. If a person violates this prohibition, you may not permit the person to vote shares in excess of ten percent, and may not count the shares in excess of ten percent in any shareholder vote.

(b) A person acquires beneficial ownership of more than ten percent of a class of shares when he or she holds any combination of your stock or revocable or irrevocable proxies under circumstances that give rise to a conclusive control determination or rebuttable control determination under §§ 574.4(a) and (b) of this chapter. OTS will presume that a person has acquired shares if the acquiror entered into a binding written agreement for the transfer of shares. For purposes of this section, an offer is made when it is communicated. An offer does not include non-binding expressions of understanding or letters of intent regarding the terms of a potential acquisition.

(c) Notwithstanding the restrictions in this section:

(1) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply to any offer with a view toward public resale made exclusively to you, to the underwriters, or to a selling group acting on your behalf.

(2) Unless OTS objects in writing, any person may offer or announce an offer to acquire up to one percent of any class of shares. In computing the one percent limit, the person must include all of his or her acquisitions of the same class of shares during the prior 12 months.

(3) A corporation whose ownership is, or will be, substantially the same as your ownership may acquire or offer to acquire more than ten percent of your common stock, if it makes the offer or acquisition more than one year after you convert.

(4) One or more of your tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans may acquire your shares, if the plan or plans do not beneficially own more than 25 percent of any class of your shares in the aggregate.

(5) An acquiror does not have to file a separate application to obtain OTS approval under paragraph (a) of this section, if the acquiror files an application under part 574 of this chapter that specifically addresses the criteria listed under paragraph (d) of this section and you do not oppose the proposed acquisition.

(d) OTS may deny an application under paragraph (a) of this section if the proposed acquisition:

(1) Is contrary to the purposes of this part;

(2) Is manipulative or deceptive;

(3) Subverts the fairness of the conversion;

(4) Is likely to injure you;

(5) Is inconsistent with your plan to meet the credit and lending needs of your proposed market area;

(6) Otherwise violates laws or regulations; or

(7) Does not prudently deploy your conversion proceeds.
