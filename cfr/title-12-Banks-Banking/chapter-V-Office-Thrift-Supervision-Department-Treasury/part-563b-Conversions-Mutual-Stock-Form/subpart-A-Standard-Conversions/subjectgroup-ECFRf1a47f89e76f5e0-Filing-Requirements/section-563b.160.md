##### § 563b.160 May I keep portions of my application for conversion confidential? #####

(a) OTS makes all filings under this part available to the public, but may keep portions of your application for conversion confidential under paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) You may request OTS to keep portions of your application confidential. To do so, you must separately bind and clearly designate as “confidential” any portion of your application for conversion that you deem confidential. You must provide a written statement specifying the grounds supporting your request for confidentiality. OTS will not treat as confidential the portion of your application describing how you plan to meet your Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) objectives. The CRA portion of your application may not incorporate by reference information contained in the confidential portion of your application.

(c) OTS will determine whether confidential information must be made available to the public under 5 U.S.C. 552 and part 505 of this chapter. OTS will advise you before it makes information you designated as “confidential” available to the public.
