At the meeting to consider your conversion, your members must separately approve by at least a majority of the total eligible votes, a contribution of conversion shares or proceeds. If you are in mutual holding company form and adding a charitable contribution as part of a second step stock conversion, you must also have your minority shareholders separately approve the charitable contribution by a majority of their total eligible votes.
