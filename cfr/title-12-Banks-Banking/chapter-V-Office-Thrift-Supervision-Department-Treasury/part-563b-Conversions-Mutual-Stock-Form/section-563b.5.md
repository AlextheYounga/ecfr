##### § 563b.5 What does this part do? #####

(a) *General.* This part governs how a savings association (“you”) may convert from the mutual to the stock form of ownership. Subpart A of this part governs standard mutual-to-stock conversions. Subpart B of this part governs voluntary supervisory mutual-to-stock conversions. This part supersedes all inconsistent charter and bylaw provisions of federal savings associations converting to stock form.

(b) *Prescribed forms.* You must use the forms prescribed under this part and provide such information as OTS may require under the forms by regulation or otherwise. The forms required under this part include: Form AC (Application for Conversion); Form PS (Proxy Statement); Form OC (Offering Circular); and Form OF (Order Form).

(c) *Waivers.* OTS may waive any requirement of this part or a provision in any prescribed form. To obtain a waiver, you must file a written request with OTS that:

(1) Specifies the requirement(s) or provision(s) you want OTS to waive;

(2) Demonstrates that the waiver is equitable; is not detrimental to you, your account holders, or other savings associations; and is not contrary to the public interest; and

(3) Includes an opinion of counsel demonstrating that applicable law does not conflict with the requirement or provision.
