You and your operating subsidiary are generally consolidated and treated as a unit for statutory and regulatory purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 (2) (i) If the federal statute or regulation specifically refers to “service corporation,” it applies to all service corporations, even if you do not control the service corporation or it is not a GAAP-consolidated subsidiary.  <br/>(ii) If the federal statute or regulation refers to “subsidiary,” it applies only to service corporations that you directly or indirectly control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|     (i) Do the investment limits that apply to federal savings associations (HOLA section 5(c) and part 560 of this chapter) apply?      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          (1) Your assets and those of your operating subsidiary are aggregated when calculating investment limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               (2) Your service corporation's assets are not subject to the same investment limitations that apply to you. The investment activities of your service corporation are governed by paragraph (e)(2) of this section and § 559.4.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|                                  (j) How does the capital regulation (part 567 of this chapter) apply?                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                (1) Your assets and those of your operating subsidiary are consolidated for all capital purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                               (2) The capital treatment of a service corporation depends upon whether it is an includable subsidiary. That determination is based upon factors set forth in part 567 of this chapter, including your percentage ownership of the service corporation and the activities in which the service corporation engages. Both debt and equity investments in service corporations that are GAAP-consolidated subsidiaries are considered investments in subsidiaries for purposes of the capital regulation, regardless of the authority under which they are made.                                                                                                                                                |

Other loans made by your operating subsidiary are aggregated with your loans for LTOB purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                        (2) The LTOB regulation does not apply to loans from you to your service corporation or from your service corporation to you. However, § 559.5 imposes restrictions on the amount of loans you may make to certain service corporations. Loans made by a service corporation that you control to entities other than you or your subordinate organizations are aggregated with your loans for LTOB purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Generally, an operating subsidiary is not an affiliate, unless it is a depository institution; is directly controlled by another affiliate of the savings association or by shareholders that control the savings association; or is an employee stock option plan, trust, or similar organization that exists for the benefit of shareholders, partners, members, or employees of the savings association or an affiliate. A non-affiliate operating subsidiary is treated as a part of the savings association and its transactions with affiliates of the savings association are aggregated with those of the savings association|(2) Section 563.41 of this chapter explains how TWA applies. Generally, a service corporation is not an affiliate, unless it is a depository institution; is directly controlled by another affiliate of the savings association or by shareholders that control the savings association; or is an employee stock option plan, trust, or similar organization that exists for the benefit of shareholders, partners, members, or employees of the savings association or an affiliate. If a savings association directly or indirectly controls a service corporation and the service corporation is not otherwise an affiliate under § 563.41 of this chapter, the service corporation is treated as a part of the savings association and its transactions with affiliates of the savings association are aggregated with those of the savings association.|
