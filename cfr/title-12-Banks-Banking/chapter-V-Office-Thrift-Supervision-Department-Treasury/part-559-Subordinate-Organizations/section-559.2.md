*GAAP-consolidated subsidiary* means an entity in which a savings association has a direct or indirect ownership interest and whose assets are consolidated with those of the savings association for purposes of reporting under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Generally, these are entities in which a savings association has a majority ownership interest.

*Lower-tier entity* includes any company in which an operating subsidiary or a service corporation has a direct or indirect ownership interest.

*Operating subsidiary* means any entity that satisfies all of the requirements for an operating subsidiary set forth in § 559.3 of this part and that is designated by the parent savings association as an operating subsidiary pursuant to § 559.3 of this part. More than 50% of the voting shares of an operating subsidiary must be owned, directly or indirectly, by a federal savings association and no other person or entity may exercise effective operating control. An operating subsidiary may only engage in activities permissible for a federal savings association.

*Ownership interest* means any equity interest in a business organization, including stock, limited or general partnership interests, or shares in a limited liability company.

A service corporation must be organized under the laws of the state where the federal savings association's home office is located, may only be owned by savings associations with home offices in that state, and may engage in the activities identified in §§ 559.3(e)(2) and 559.4 of this part.

*Subordinate organization* means any corporation, partnership, business trust, association, joint venture, pool, syndicate, or other similar business organization in which a savings association has a direct or indirect ownership interest, unless that ownership interest qualifies as a pass-through investment pursuant to § 560.32 of this chapter and is so designated by the investing savings association.
