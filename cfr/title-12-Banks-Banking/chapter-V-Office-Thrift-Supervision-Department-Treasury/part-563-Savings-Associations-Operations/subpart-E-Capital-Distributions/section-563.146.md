(a) You will be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized as set forth in ยง 565.4(b) of this chapter, following the capital distribution. If so, the OTS will determine if your capital distribution is permitted under 12 U.S.C. 1831o(d)(1)(B).

(b) Your proposed capital distribution raises safety or soundness concerns.

(c) Your proposed capital distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, agreement between you and the OTS (or the Corporation), or a condition imposed on you in an OTS-approved application or notice.
