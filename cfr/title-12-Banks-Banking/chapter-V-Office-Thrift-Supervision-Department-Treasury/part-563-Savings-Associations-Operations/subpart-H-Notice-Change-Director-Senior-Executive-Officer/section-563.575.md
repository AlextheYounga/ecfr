##### ยง 563.575 What procedures govern OTS review of my notice for completeness? #####

The OTS will first review your notice to determine whether it is complete.

(a) If your notice is complete, the OTS will notify you in writing of the date that the OTS received the complete notice.

(b) If your notice is not complete, the OTS will notify you in writing what additional information you need to submit, why we need the information, and when you must submit it. You must, within the specified time period, provide additional information or request that the OTS suspend processing of the notice. If you fail to act within the specified time period, the OTS may treat the notice as withdrawn or may review the application based on the information provided.
