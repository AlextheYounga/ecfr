##### ยง 563.161 Management and financial policies. #####

(a)(1) For the protection of depositors and other savings associations, each savings association and each service corporation must be well managed and operate safely and soundly. Each also must pursue financial policies that are safe and consistent with economical home financing and the purposes of savings associations. In implementing this section, OTS will consider that service corporations may be authorized to engage in activities that involve a higher degree of risk than activities permitted to savings associations.

(2) As part of meeting its requirements under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, each savings association and service corporation must maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation.

(b) Compensation to officers, directors, and employees of each savings association and its service corporations shall not be in excess of that which is reasonable and commensurate with their duties and responsibilities. Former officers, directors, and employees of savings association or its service corporation who regularly perform services therefor under consulting contracts are employees thereof for purposes of this paragraph (b).
