##### § 563f.6 General exemption. #####

(a) *Exemption.* The OTS may by agency order exempt an interlock from the prohibitions in § 563f.3 if the OTS finds that the interlock would not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition and would not present safety and soundness concerns. A depository organization may apply to OTS for an exemption under part 516, subpart E, of this chapter.

(b) *Presumptions.* In reviewing an application for an exemption under this section, the OTS will apply a rebuttable presumption that an interlock will not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition if the depository organization seeking to add a management official:

(1) Primarily serves low- and moderate-income areas;

(2) Is controlled or managed by persons who are members of a minority group, or women;

(3) Is a depository institution that or has been chartered for less than two years; or

(4) Is deemed to be in “troubled condition” as defined in § 563.555 of this chapter.

(c) *Duration.* Unless a shorter expiration period is provided in the OTS approval, an exemption permitted by paragraph (a) of this section may continue so long as it does not result in a monopoly or substantial lessening of competition, or is unsafe or unsound. If the OTS grants an interlock exemption in reliance upon a presumption under paragraph (b) of this section, the interlock may continue for three years, unless otherwise provided by the OTS in writing.
