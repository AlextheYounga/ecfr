##### ยง 508.11 Relevant considerations. #####

(a) In determining whether the petitioner has shown that his or her continued service to or participation in the conduct of the affairs of the association would not, or is not likely to, pose a threat to the interests of the association's depositors or threaten to impair public confidence in the association, in order to decide whether the Notice or Order should be continued, terminated, or otherwise modified, the Office will consider:

(1) The nature and extent of the petitioner's participation in the affairs of the association;

(2) The nature of the offense with which the petitioner has been charged;

(3) The extent of the publicity accorded the indictment and trial; and

(4) Such other relevant factors as may be entered on the record.

(b) When considering a request for the termination or modification of a Notice, the Office will not consider the ultimate guilt or innocence of the petitioner with respect to the criminal charge that is outstanding.

(c) When considering a request for the termination or modification of an Order which has been issued following a final judgment of conviction against a subject individual, the Office will not collaterally review such final judgment of conviction.
