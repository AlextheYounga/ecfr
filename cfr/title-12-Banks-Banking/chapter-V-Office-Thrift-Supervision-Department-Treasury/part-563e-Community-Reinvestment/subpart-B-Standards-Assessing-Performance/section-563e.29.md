(1) The establishment of a domestic branch or other facility that would be authorized to take deposits;

(2) The relocation of the main office or a branch;

(3) The merger or consolidation with or the acquisition of the assets or assumption of the liabilities of an insured depository institution requiring OTS approval under the Bank Merger Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(c));
