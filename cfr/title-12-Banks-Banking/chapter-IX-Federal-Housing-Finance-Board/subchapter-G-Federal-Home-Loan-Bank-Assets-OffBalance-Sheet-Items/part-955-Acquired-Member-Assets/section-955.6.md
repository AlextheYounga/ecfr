##### ยง 955.6 Risk-based capital requirement for acquired member assets. #####

(a) *General.* Each Bank shall hold retained earnings plus general allowance for losses as support for the credit risk of all AMA estimated by the Bank to represent a credit risk that is greater than that of comparable instruments that have received the second highest credit rating from an NRSRO in an amount equal to or greater than the outstanding balance of the assets or pools of assets times a factor associated with the putative credit rating of the assets or pools of assets as determined by the Finance Board on a case-by-case basis. For single-family mortgage assets, the factors are as set forth in Table 1 of this part.
