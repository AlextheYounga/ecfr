(1) The term “news” means information about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.

(2) Examples of news media entities include, but are not limited to, television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of newspapers and other periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as disseminators of “news”) who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public.

(3) “Freelance” journalists may be regarded as working for a news organization if they can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, even though not actually employed by it.

Such activity is distinct from “review” of material to determine whether the material is exempt from disclosure.

(2) *Search* does not mean or include research, creation of any document, or extensive modification of an existing program or system that would significantly interfere with the operation of the Committee's automated information system.
