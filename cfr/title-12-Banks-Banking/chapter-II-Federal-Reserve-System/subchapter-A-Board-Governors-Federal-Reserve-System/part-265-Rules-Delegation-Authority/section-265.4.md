##### § 265.4 Functions delegated to Board members. #####

(a) *Individual members.* Any Board member designated by the Chairman is authorized:

(1) *Approval of amendments to notice of charges or cease and desist orders.* To approve (after receiving recommendations of the Director of the Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation and the General Counsel) amendments to any notice, temporary order, or proposed order previously approved by the Board in a specific formal enforcement matter (including a notice of charges or removal notice) or any proposed or temporary cease and desist order previously approved by the Board under 12 U.S.C. 1818 (b) and (c).

(2) *Requests for permission to appeal rulings.* (i) To act, when requested by the Secretary, upon any request under § 263.10(e) of the Board's Rules of Practice for Hearings (12 CFR part 263) for special permission to appeal from a ruling of the presiding officer on any motion made at a hearing conducted under the rules, and if special permission is granted, the merits of the appeal shall be presented to the Board for decision.

(ii) Notwithstanding § 265.3 of this part, the denial of special permission to appeal a ruling may be reviewed by the Board only if a Board member requests a review within two days of the denial.

(1) *Absence of quorum.* To act, upon certification by the Secretary of the Board of an absence of a quorum of the Board present in person, by unanimous vote on any matter that the Chairman has certified must be acted upon promptly in order to avoid delay that would be inconsistent with the public interest except for matters:
