##### § 268.205 Employment of aliens; Access to sensitive information. #####

(a) *Definitions.* The definitions contained in this paragraph (a) apply only to this section:

(1) *Classified Information* means information that is classified for national security purposes under Executive Order No. 12958, entitled “Classified National Security Information,” including any amendments or superseding orders that the President of the United States may issue from time to time.

(2) *Confidential Supervisory Information* means confidential supervisory information of the Board, as defined in 12 CFR 261.2(c). Three internal security designations, which are subject to change by the Board, apply to Confidential Supervisory Information. Those designations are:

(i) *Restricted-Controlled FR* generally applies to information that, if disclosed to or modified by unauthorized individuals, might result in the risk of serious monetary loss, serious productivity loss or serious embarrassment to the Federal Reserve System. Examples of Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Restricted-Controlled FR include, but are not limited to, certain significant lists of financial institution supervisory ratings and nonpublic advance information regarding bank mergers or failures.

(ii) *Restricted FR* covers information that is less sensitive than Restricted-Controlled FR information and, in general, is the largest category of Confidential Supervisory Information. This information, if disclosed to or modified by unauthorized individuals, might result in the risk of significant monetary loss, significant productivity loss, or significant embarrassment to the Federal Reserve System. Examples of Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Restricted FR include, but are not limited to, single supervisory ratings (e.g., CAMELS, BOPEC, etc.), Federal Reserve examination and inspection reports and workpapers, Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee (ICERC) country exposure determinations, and shared national credit data or listings.

(iii) *Internal FR* covers information that is less sensitive than Restricted FR or Restricted-Controlled FR and generally applies to information that, if disclosed to or modified by unauthorized individuals, might result in the risk of some monetary loss, some productivity loss, or some embarrassment to the Federal Reserve System. Examples of Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Internal FR include, but are not limited to, foreign banking organization country studies and Federal Reserve risk assessments.

(3) *Country List* refers to the list contained in the annual federal appropriations laws of specific countries, including a general category of “countries allied with the United States in a current defense effort,” from which particular categories of persons who are exempt from a ban on the use of appropriated funds are eligible to be hired as Federal employees in the excepted service or in the senior executive service. The appropriations ban is codified at 5 U.S.C. 3101 note. The list of eligible countries and persons is subject to legislative and other change.

(4) *Eligible Position* refers to a position or job family requiring access to Sensitive Information for which the Board determines that hiring a Non-Citizen is appropriate.

(5) *Employee* means an individual who works full-time or part-time and is appointed into Board service for a period of more than 90 days. The term “Employee” does not include members of the Board.

(6) *FOMC Information* means confidential information of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) regardless of the form or format in which it is created, conveyed, or maintained. FOMC Information includes information derived from confidential FOMC materials. Three internal security designations, which are subject to change by the FOMC, apply to FOMC Information as follows:

(i) *Class I FOMC* generally applies to materials containing policymaker input, such as that related to monetary policy decisions at meetings, views expressed by policy makers on future policy, and identification of meeting participants who express particular views. Examples of Class I FOMC Information include, but are not limited to, the “Bluebook,” drafts of meeting minutes, unreleased meeting transcripts, documents reflecting the preparation of semi-annual forecasts and related testimony, and certain sensitive internal memorandums and reports.

(ii) *Class II FOMC* covers information that is less sensitive than Class I FOMC. This designation generally applies to staff forecasts prepared for the FOMC and to information about open market operations. Examples of Class II FOMC Information include, but are not limited to, Part I of the “Greenbook,” reports of the Manager on domestic and foreign open market operations, and other materials on economic and financial developments.

(iii) *Class III FOMC* covers information that is less sensitive than either Class II or Class I. This designation generally applies to background information supporting policy discussions and includes, but is not limited to, Part II of the Greenbook.

(7) *National* refers to any individual who meets the requirements described in 8 U.S.C. 1408.

(8) *Non-Citizen* refers to any individual who is not a Protected Individual.

(9) *Protected Individual* means -

(3) *Confidential Supervisory Information* - (i) *Access by a Non-Citizen from a country on the Country List.* An Employee in an Eligible Position who is a Non-Citizen from a country that, on the date the Employee begins employment with the Federal Reserve System or on the date access is granted, is on the Country List shall be granted access to Confidential Supervisory Information designated as Restricted-Controlled FR only if the Employee:
