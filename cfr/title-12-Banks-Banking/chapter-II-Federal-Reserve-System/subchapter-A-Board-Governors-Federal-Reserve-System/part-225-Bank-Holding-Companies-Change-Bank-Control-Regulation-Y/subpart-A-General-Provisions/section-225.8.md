(*iii*) The bank holding company's capital planning process or proposed capital distributions otherwise constitute an unsafe or unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Board order, directive, or condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Board or the appropriate Reserve Bank. In determining whether a capital plan or any proposed capital distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice, the Board or the appropriate Reserve Bank would consider whether the bank holding company is and would remain in sound financial condition after giving effect to the capital plan and all proposed capital distributions.

(*3*) Notwithstanding paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*) of this section, a bank holding company that was subject to this section as of January 1, 2019, and that receives a qualitative objection in the fourth year of the four-year period described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*), pursuant to the criteria in paragraph (f)(2)(ii)(B)(*2*)(*i*) through (*iii*) of this section, will remain subject to a qualitative objection under this section until January 1 of the year after the first year in which the bank holding company does not receive a qualitative objection.

(v) *Publication of summary results.* The Board may disclose publicly its decision to object or not object to a bank holding company's capital plan under this section, along with a summary of the Board's analyses of that company. Any disclosure under this paragraph will occur by June 30 of the calendar year in which a capital plan was submitted pursuant to paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, unless the Board determines that a later disclosure date is appropriate.
