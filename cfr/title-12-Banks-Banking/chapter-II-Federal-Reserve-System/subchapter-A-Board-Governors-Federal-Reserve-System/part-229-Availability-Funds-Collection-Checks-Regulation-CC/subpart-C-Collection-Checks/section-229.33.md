Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 27580, June 15, 2017.

(a) *Requirement.* If a paying bank determines not to pay a check in the amount of $2,500 or more, it shall provide notice of nonpayment such that the notice is received by the depositary bank by 4:00 p.m. (local time) on the second business day following the banking day on which the check was presented to the paying bank. If the day the paying bank is required to provide notice is not a banking day for the depositary bank, receipt of notice on the depositary bank's next banking day constitutes timely notice. Notice may be provided by any reasonable means, including the returned check, a writing (including a copy of the check), telephone, Fedwire, telex, or other form of telegraph.

(b) *Content of notice.* Notice must include the -

(1) Name and routing number of the paying bank;

(2) Name of the payee(s);

(3) Amount;

(4) Date of the indorsement of the depositary bank;

(5) Account number of the customer(s) of the depositary bank;

(6) Branch name or number of the depositary bank from its indorsement;

(7) Trace number associated with the indorsement of the depositary bank; and

(8) Reason for nonpayment.

The notice may include other information from the check that may be useful in identifying the check being returned and the customer, and, in the case of a written notice, must include the name and routing number of the depositary bank from its indorsement. If the paying bank is not sure of an item of information, it shall include the information required by this paragraph to the extent possible, and identify any item of information for which the bank is not sure of the accuracy.

(c) *Acceptance of notice.* The depositary bank shall accept notices during its banking day -

(1) Either at the telephone or telegraph number of its return check unit indicated in the indorsement, or, if no such number appears in the indorsement or if the number is illegible, at the general purpose telephone or telegraph number of its head office or the branch indicated in the indorsement; and

(2) At any other number held out by the bank for receipt of notice of nonpayment, and, in the case of written notice, as specified in ยง 229.32(a).

(d) *Notification to customer.* If the depositary bank receives a returned check or notice of nonpayment, it shall send or give notice to its customer of the facts by midnight of the banking day following the banking day on which it received the returned check or notice, or within a longer reasonable time.

(e) *Depositary bank without accounts.* The requirements of this section do not apply to checks deposited in a depositary bank that does not maintain accounts.
