Such application shall be filed promptly after the first report of condition that reflects the increase or decrease occasioning the adjustment. In addition, every member bank shall file an application for issue or cancellation of Reserve Bank capital stock if needed in order to adjust its Reserve Bank capital stock subscription to equal six percent of the member bank's capital and surplus as shown on its report of condition as of December 31 of each year promptly after filing such report.

Such application shall be filed promptly after the first report of condition that reflects the increase or decrease occasioning the adjustment.
