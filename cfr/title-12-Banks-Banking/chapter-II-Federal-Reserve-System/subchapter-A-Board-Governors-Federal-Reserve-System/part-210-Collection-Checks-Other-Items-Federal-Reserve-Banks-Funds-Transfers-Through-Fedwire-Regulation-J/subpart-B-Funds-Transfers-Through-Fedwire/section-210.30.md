##### ยง 210.30 Payment orders. #####

(a) *Rejection.* A sender shall not send a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank unless authorized to do so by the Federal Reserve Bank. A Federal Reserve Bank may reject, or impose conditions that must be satisfied before it will accept, a payment order for any reason.

(b) *Selection of an intermediary bank.* For an interdistrict transfer, a Federal Reserve Bank is authorized and directed to execute a payment order through another Federal Reserve Bank. A sender shall not send a payment order to a Federal Reserve Bank that requires the Federal Reserve Bank to issue a payment order to an intermediary bank (other than a Federal Reserve Bank) unless that intermediary bank is designated in the sender's payment order. A sender shall not send to a Federal Reserve Bank a payment order instructing use by a Federal Reserve Bank of a funds-transfer system or means of transmission other than Fedwire, unless the Federal Reserve Bank agrees with the sender in writing to follow such instructions.

(c) *Same-day execution.* A sender shall not issue a payment order that instructs a Federal Reserve Bank to execute the payment order on a funds-transfer business day that is later than the funds-transfer business day on which the order is received by the Federal Reserve Bank, unless the Federal Reserve Bank agrees with the sender in writing to follow such instructions.
