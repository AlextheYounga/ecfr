##### ยง 238.117 Subpoenas. #####

(a) *Service.* Service of a subpoena in connection with any investigative proceeding or formal examination proceeding shall be effected in the following manner:

(1) *Service upon a natural person.* Service of a subpoena upon a natural person may be effected by handing it to such person; by leaving it at his office with the person in charge thereof, or, if there is no one in charge, by leaving it in a conspicuous place therein; by leaving it at his dwelling place or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein; by mailing it to him by registered or certified mail or by an express delivery service at his last known address; or by any method whereby actual notice is given to him.

(2) *Service upon other persons.* When the person to be served is not a natural person, service of the subpoena may be effected by handing the subpoena to a registered agent for service, or to any officer, director, or agent in charge of any office of such person; by mailing it to any such representative by registered or certified mail or by an express delivery service at his last known address; or by any method whereby actual notice is given to such person.

(b) *Motions to quash.* Any person to whom a subpoena is directed may, prior to the time specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 10 days after the date of service of such subpoena, apply to the Board or its designee to quash or modify such subpoena, accompanying such application with a statement of the reasons therefore. The Board or its designee, as appropriate, may:

(1) Deny the application;

(2) Quash or revoke the subpoena;

(3) Modify the subpoena; or

(4) Condition the granting of the application on such terms as the Board or its designee determines to be just, reasonable, and proper.

(c) *Attendance of witnesses.* Subpoenas issued in connection with an investigative proceeding or formal examination proceeding may require the attendance and/or testimony of witnesses from any State or territory of the United States and the production by such witnesses of documentary or other tangible evidence at any designated place where the proceeding is being (or is to be) conducted. Foreign nationals are subject to such subpoenas if such service is made upon a duly authorized agent located in the United States.

(d) *Witness fees and mileage.* Witnesses summoned in any proceeding under this part shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid witnesses in the district courts of the United States. Such fees and mileage need not be tendered when the subpoena is issued on behalf of the Board by any of its designated representatives.
