<sup>1</sup> Table 5 does not cover equity exposures, which should be reported in Table 9.

<sup>2</sup>See, for example, ASC Topic 815-10 and 210, as they may be amended from time to time.

<sup>3</sup> Geographical areas may consist of individual countries, groups of countries, or regions within countries. A Board-regulated institution might choose to define the geographical areas based on the way the Board-regulated institution's portfolio is geographically managed. The criteria used to allocate the loans to geographical areas must be specified.

<sup>4</sup> A Board-regulated institution is encouraged also to provide an analysis of the aging of past-due loans.

<sup>5</sup> The portion of the general allowance that is not allocated to a geographical area should be disclosed separately.

<sup>6</sup> The reconciliation should include the following: A description of the allowance; the opening balance of the allowance; charge-offs taken against the allowance during the period; amounts provided (or reversed) for estimated probable loan losses during the period; any other adjustments (for example, exchange rate differences, business combinations, acquisitions and disposals of subsidiaries), including transfers between allowances; and the closing balance of the allowance. Charge-offs and recoveries that have been recorded directly to the income statement should be disclosed separately.

<sup>1</sup> At a minimum, a Board-regulated institution must provide the disclosures in Table 7 in relation to credit risk mitigation that has been recognized for the purposes of reducing capital requirements under this subpart. Where relevant, Board-regulated institutions are encouraged to give further information about mitigants that have not been recognized for that purpose.

<sup>2</sup> Credit derivatives that are treated, for the purposes of this subpart, as synthetic securitization exposures should be excluded from the credit risk mitigation disclosures and included within those relating to securitization (Table 8).

<sup>1</sup> The Board-regulated institution should describe the structure of resecuritizations in which it participates; this description should be provided for the main categories of resecuritization products in which the Board-regulated institution is active.

<sup>2</sup> For example, these roles may include originator, investor, servicer, provider of credit enhancement, sponsor, liquidity provider, or swap provider.

<sup>3</sup> Such affiliated entities may include, for example, money market funds, to be listed individually, and personal and private trusts, to be noted collectively.

<sup>4</sup> “Exposures securitized” include underlying exposures originated by the bank, whether generated by them or purchased, and recognized in the balance sheet, from third parties, and third-party exposures included in sponsored transactions. Securitization transactions (including underlying exposures originally on the bank's balance sheet and underlying exposures acquired by the bank from third-party entities) in which the originating bank does not retain any securitization exposure should be shown separately but need only be reported for the year of inception. Banks are required to disclose exposures regardless of whether there is a capital charge under this part.

<sup>5</sup> Include credit-related other than temporary impairment (OTTI).

<sup>6</sup> For example, charge-offs/allowances (if the assets remain on the bank's balance sheet) or credit-related OTTI of interest-only strips and other retained residual interests, as well as recognition of liabilities for probable future financial support required of the bank with respect to securitized assets.
