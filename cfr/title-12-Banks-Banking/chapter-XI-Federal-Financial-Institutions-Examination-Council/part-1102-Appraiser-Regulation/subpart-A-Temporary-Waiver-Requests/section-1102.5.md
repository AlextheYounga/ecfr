Within 45 calendar days of the date of the publication of the notice or initiation order in the Federal Register, the ASC, by order, shall either grant or deny a waiver in whole, in part, and upon specified terms and conditions, including provisions for waiver termination. Such order shall respond to comments received from interested members of the public and shall provide the reasons for the ASC's finding. The order shall be published promptly in the Federal Register, which, in the case of an approval order, shall be after Federal Financial Institution Examination Council concurrence. Upon the ASC's determination that an emergency exists, the ASC may issue an interim approval order simultaneously with its action under ยง 1120.4 of this subpart. Any ASC approval order shall be effective only upon Federal Financial Institution Examination Council concurrence.
