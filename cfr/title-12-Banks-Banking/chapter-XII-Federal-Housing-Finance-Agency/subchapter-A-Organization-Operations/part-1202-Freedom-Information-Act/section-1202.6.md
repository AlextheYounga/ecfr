##### ยง 1202.6 What if my request does not have all the information FHFA requires? #####

If FHFA determines that your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek, is overly broad, unduly burdensome to process, cannot yet be processed for reasons related to fees, or lacks required information, you will be informed in writing why your request cannot be processed. You will be given 15 calendar days to modify your request to meet all requirements. This request for additional information tolls the time period for FHFA to respond to your request under ยง 1202.7 of this part.

(a) If you respond with all the necessary information, FHFA will process this response as a new request and the time period for FHFA to respond to your request will start from the date the additional information is actually received by FHFA.

(b) If you do not respond or provide additional information within the time allowed, or if the additional information you provide is still incomplete or insufficient, FHFA will consider your request withdrawn and will notify you that it will not be processed.
