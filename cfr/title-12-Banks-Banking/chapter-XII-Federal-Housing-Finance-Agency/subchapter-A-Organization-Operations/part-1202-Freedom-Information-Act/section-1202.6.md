##### ยง 1202.6 What if my request does not have all the information FHFA or FHFA-OIG requires? #####

If FHFA or FHFA-OIG determines that your request does not reasonably describe the records you seek, is overly broad, cannot yet be processed for reasons related to fees, or lacks required information, you will be informed in writing why your request cannot be processed. You will be given 15 calendar days to modify your request to meet all requirements. This request for additional information tolls the time period for FHFA or FHFA-OIG to respond to your request under ยง 1202.7.

(a) If you respond with the necessary information, FHFA or FHFA-OIG will process that response as a new request and the time period for FHFA or FHFA-OIG to respond to your request will start from the date the additional information is actually received by FHFA or FHFA-OIG.

(b) If you do not respond or provide additional information within the time allowed, or if the additional information you provide is still incomplete or insufficient, FHFA and FHFA-OIG will consider your request withdrawn and will notify you that it will not be processed.
