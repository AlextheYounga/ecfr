##### ยง 1202.1 Why did FHFA issue this regulation? #####

(a) The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552), is a federal law that requires FHFA and other Federal Government agencies to disclose certain Federal Government records to the public.

(b) This regulation explains the rules that FHFA and the FHFA Office of Inspector General (FHFA-OIG) both follow when processing and responding to requests for records under FOIA. It also explains what you must do to request records from FHFA or FHFA-OIG under FOIA. You should read this regulation together with FOIA, which explains in more detail your rights and the records FHFA or FHFA-OIG may release to you.

(c) If you want to request information about yourself, this is considered a first-party or Privacy Act request under the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), and therefore you should file your request using FHFA's Privacy Act regulations at part 1204 of this title. If you file a request for information about yourself, FHFA or FHFA-OIG will process this request under both FOIA and Privacy Act in order to give you the greatest degree of access to any responsive material.

(d) FHFA and FHFA-OIG may make public information that they routinely publish or disclose when performing their activities without following these procedures.

(e) This regulation applies to both FHFA and FHFA-OIG.
