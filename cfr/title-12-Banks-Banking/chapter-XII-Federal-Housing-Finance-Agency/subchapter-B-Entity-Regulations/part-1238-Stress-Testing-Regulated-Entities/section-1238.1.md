(b) *Purpose.* (1) This part implements section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires all large financial companies that have total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion, and are regulated by a primary federal financial regulatory agency, to conduct annual stress tests. To ensure the safety and soundness of the regulated entities, the Director reserves and retains the discretion to apply this part to any regulated entity with less than $10 billion total consolidated assets in a particular year.

(2) This part establishes requirements that apply to each regulated entity's performance of annual stress tests. The purpose of the annual stress test is to provide the regulated entities, FHFA, and the FRB with additional, forward-looking information that will help them to assess capital adequacy at the regulated entities under various scenarios; to review the regulated entities' stress test results; and to increase public disclosure of the regulated entities' capital condition by requiring broad dissemination of the stress test scenarios and results.
