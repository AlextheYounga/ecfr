##### § 1236.4 Failure to meet a standard; corrective plans. #####

(a) *Determination.* FHFA may, based upon an examination, inspection or any other information, determine that a regulated entity has failed to meet one or more of the Standards.

(b) *Submission of corrective plan.* If FHFA determines that a regulated entity has failed to meet any Standard, FHFA may require the entity to submit a corrective plan, in which case FHFA shall, by written notice, inform the regulated entity of that determination and the requirement to submit a corrective plan.

(c) *Corrective plans*—(1) *Contents of plan.* A corrective plan shall describe the actions the regulated entity will take to correct its failure to meet any one or more of the Standards, and the time within which each action will be taken.

(2) *Filing deadline*—(i) *In general.* A regulated entity must file a written corrective plan with FHFA within thirty (30) calendar days of being notified by FHFA of its failure to meet a Standard and need to file a corrective plan, unless FHFA notifies the regulated entity in writing that the plan must be filed within a different time period.

(ii) *Other plans.* If a regulated entity must file a capital restoration plan submitted pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 4622, it may submit the corrective plan required under this section as part of the capital restoration plan, subject to the deadline in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. If a regulated entity currently is operating under a cease-and-desist order entered into pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 4631 or 4632, or a formal or informal agreement, or must file a response to a report of examination or report of inspection, it may, with the permission of FHFA, submit the corrective plan required under this section as part of the regulated entity's compliance with that order, agreement or response, subject to the deadline in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, but the corrective plan would not become a part of the order, agreement, or response.

(d) *Amendment of corrective plan.* A regulated entity that is operating in accordance with an approved corrective plan may submit a written request to FHFA to amend the plan as necessary to reflect any changes in circumstance. Until such time that FHFA approves a proposed amendment, the regulated entity must continue to operate in accordance with the terms of the corrective plan as previously approved.

(e) *Review of corrective plans and amendments.* Within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving a corrective plan or proposed amendment to a plan, FHFA will notify the regulated entity in writing of its decision on the plan, will direct the regulated entity to submit additional information, or will notify the regulated entity in writing that FHFA has established a different deadline.
