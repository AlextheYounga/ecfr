(e) *Credit enhancement multiplier* - (1) *Amount* - (i) *In general.* The adjusted credit enhancement multiplier for a single-family mortgage exposure that is subject to loan-level credit enhancement is equal to 1.0 minus the product of:

(A) 1.0 minus the credit enhancement multiplier for the single-family mortgage exposure as determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; multiplied by

(B) 1.0 minus the counterparty haircut for the loan-level credit enhancement as determined under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.

(ii) *No loan-level credit enhancement.* The adjusted credit enhancement multiplier for a single-family mortgage exposure that is not subject to loan-level credit enhancement is equal to 1.0.

(2) *Credit enhancement multiplier.* (i) The credit enhancement multiplier for a single-family mortgage exposure that is subject to a participation agreement is 1.0.

(ii) Subject to paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, the credit enhancement multiplier for -

(A) A performing loan, non-modified RPL, or modified RPL that is subject to non-cancelable mortgage insurance is set forth on Table 7 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section;

(B) A performing loan or non-modified RPL that is subject to cancelable mortgage insurance is set forth on Table 8 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section;

(C) A modified RPL with a 30-year post-modification amortization that is subject to cancelable mortgage insurance is set forth on Table 9 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section;

(D) A modified RPL with a 40-year post-modification amortization that is subject to cancelable mortgage insurance is set forth on Table 10 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section; and

(E) NPL, whether subject to non-cancelable mortgage insurance or cancelable mortgage insurance, is set forth on Table 11 to paragraph (e)(2)(iii)(E) of this section.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (e), for purposes of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section:

(A) The OLTV of a single-family mortgage exposure will be deemed to be 80 percent if the single-family mortgage exposure has an OLTV less than or equal to 80 percent.

(B) If the single-family mortgage exposure has an interest-only feature, any cancelable mortgage insurance will be deemed to be non-cancelable mortgage insurance.

(C) If the coverage percent of the mortgage insurance is greater than charter-level coverage and less than guide-level coverage, the credit enhancement multiplier is the amount equal to a linear interpolation between the credit enhancement multiplier of the single-family mortgage exposure for charter-level coverage and the credit enhancement multiplier of the single-family mortgage exposure for guide-level coverage.

(D) If the coverage percent of the mortgage insurance is less than charter-level coverage, the credit enhancement multiplier is the amount equal to the midpoint of a linear interpolation between a credit enhancement multiplier of 1.0 and the credit enhancement multiplier of the single-family mortgage exposure for charter-level coverage.

(E) If the coverage percent of the mortgage insurance is greater than guide-level coverage, the credit enhancement multiplier is determined as if the coverage percent were guide-level coverage.

(3) *Credit enhancement counterparty haircut* - (i) *Counterparty rating* - (A) *In general.* For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3), the counterparty rating for a counterparty is -

(*1*) 1, if the Enterprise has determined that the counterparty has extremely strong capacity to perform its financial obligations in a severely adverse stress;

(*2*) 2, if the Enterprise has determined that the counterparty has very strong capacity to perform its financial obligations in a severely adverse stress;

(*3*) 3, if the Enterprise has determined that the counterparty has strong capacity to perform its financial obligations in a severely adverse stress;

(*4*) 4, if the Enterprise has determined that the counterparty has adequate capacity to perform its financial obligations in a severely adverse stress;

(*5*) 5, if the Enterprise has determined that the counterparty does not have adequate capacity to perform its financial obligations in a severely adverse stress but does have adequate capacity to perform its financial obligations in an adverse stress;

(*6*) 6, if the Enterprise has determined that the counterparty does not have adequate capacity to perform its financial obligations in an adverse stress;

(*7*) 7, if the Enterprise has determined that the counterparty's capacity to perform its financial obligations is questionable under prevailing economic conditions;

(*8*) 8, if the Enterprise has determined that the counterparty is in default on a material contractual obligation (including any obligation with respect to collateral requirements) or is under a resolution proceeding or similar regulatory proceeding.

(B) *Required considerations.* (*1*) In determining the capacity of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations, the Enterprise must consider the likelihood that the counterparty will not perform its material obligations with respect to the posting of collateral and the payment of any amounts payable under its contractual obligations.

(*2*) A counterparty does not have an adequate capacity to perform its financial obligations in a severely adverse stress if there is a material risk that the counterparty would fail to timely perform any financial obligation in a severely adverse stress.

(ii) *Counterparty haircut.* The counterparty haircut is set forth on table 12 to this paragraph (e)(3)(ii). For purposes of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii), RPL means either a modified RPL or a non-modified RPL.

(f) *COVID-19-related forbearances* - (1) *During forbearance.* Notwithstanding anything to the contrary under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the base risk weight for an NPL is equal to the product of 0.45 and the base risk weight that would otherwise be assigned to the NPL under paragraph (c)(4) of this section if the NPL -

(i) Is subject to a COVID-19-related forbearance; or

(ii) Was subject to a COVID-19-related forbearance at any time in the prior 6 calendar months and is subject to a trial modification plan.

(2) *After forbearance.* Notwithstanding the definition of “past due” under paragraph (a) of this section, any period of time in which a single-family mortgage exposure was past due while subject to a COVID-19-related forbearance is to be disregarded for the purpose of assigning a risk weight under this section if the entire amount past due was repaid upon the termination of the COVID-19-related forbearance.
