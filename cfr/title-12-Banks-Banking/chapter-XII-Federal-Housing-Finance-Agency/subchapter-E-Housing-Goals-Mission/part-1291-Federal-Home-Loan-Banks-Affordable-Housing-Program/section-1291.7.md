(2) *Reliance on long-term tax credit monitoring for rental projects.* For completed AHP rental projects that have been allocated federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (tax credits), a Bank may, in its discretion, for purposes of long-term AHP monitoring under its competitive application program, rely on the monitoring by the state-designated housing credit agency administering the tax credits of the income targeting and rent requirements applicable under the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program, and the Bank need not obtain and review reports from such agency or otherwise monitor the projects' long-term AHP compliance.

(3) *Reliance on other long-term governmental monitoring for rental projects.* For completed AHP rental projects that received funds other than tax credits from federal, state, or local government entities, a Bank may, in its discretion, for purposes of long-term AHP monitoring under its competitive application program, rely on the monitoring by such entities of the income targeting and rent requirements applicable under their programs, provided that the Bank can show that:

(i) The compliance profiles regarding income targeting, rent, and retention period requirements of the AHP and the other programs are substantively equivalent;

(ii) The entity has demonstrated and continues to demonstrate its ability to monitor the project;

(iii) The entity agrees to provide reports to the Bank on the project's incomes and rents for the full 15-year AHP retention period; and

The risk-based sampling plan and its basis shall be in writing.

(5) *Annual adjustment of targeting commitments.* For purposes of determining compliance with the targeting commitments in an approved AHP application for both initial and long-term AHP monitoring purposes under a Bank's competitive application program, such commitments shall be considered to adjust annually according to the current applicable median income data.
