##### ยง 1282.22 Housing plans. #####

(a) *General.* If the Director determines that an Enterprise has failed, or that there is a substantial probability that an Enterprise will fail, to meet any housing goal or subgoal, and that the achievement of the housing goal or subgoal was or is feasible, the Director may require the Enterprise to submit a housing plan for approval by the Director.

(b) *Measurement buffers for 2025-2027.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the Director will not require an Enterprise to submit a housing plan based on the Enterprise's failure to meet the single-family low-income families housing goal, the single-family very low-income families housing goal, or the single-family refinancing housing goal for the years 2025, 2026, or 2027, if:

(i) The share of the market as defined in ยง 1282.12(b) for the applicable goal is lower than the benchmark level for the goal; and

(ii) The Enterprise's performance meets or exceeds the share of the market minus the measurement buffer for the applicable goal as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(2) The following measurement buffers apply for the years 2025, 2026, and 2027:

(i) For the single-family low-income families housing goal, 1.3 percentage points;

(ii) For the single-family very low-income families housing goal, 0.5 percentage points; and

(iii) For the single-family refinancing housing goal, 1.3 percentage points.

(3) The measurement buffers in this paragraph (b) will not apply to a goal in 2027 if the Enterprise failed to meet that goal for each of the previous two years.

(c) *Nature of plan.* If the Director requires a housing plan, the housing plan must:

(1) Be feasible;

(2) Be sufficiently specific to enable the Director to monitor compliance periodically;

(3) Describe the specific actions that the Enterprise will take in a time period determined by the Director to improve the Enterprise's performance under the housing goal or subgoal; and

(4) Address any additional matters relevant to the plan as required, in writing, by the Director.

(d) *Deadline for submission.* The Enterprise shall submit the housing plan to the Director within 45 days after issuance of a notice requiring the Enterprise to submit a housing plan. The Director may extend the deadline for submission of a plan, in writing and for a time certain, to the extent the Director determines an extension is necessary.

(e) *Review of housing plans.* The Director shall review and approve or disapprove housing plans in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 4566(c)(4) and (c)(5).

(f) *Resubmission.* If the Director disapproves an initial housing plan submitted by an Enterprise, the Enterprise shall submit an amended plan for approval or disapproval not later than 15 days after the Director's disapproval of the initial plan; the Director may extend the deadline if the Director determines an extension is in the public interest. If an amended plan is not acceptable to the Director, the Director may afford the Enterprise 15 days to submit additional amendments to its plan for approval or disapproval.

(g) *Enforcement of housing plans.* If the Director requires an Enterprise to submit a housing plan and the Enterprise refuses to submit such a plan, submits an unacceptable plan, or fails to comply with the plan, the Director may issue a cease and desist order in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 4581, impose civil money penalties in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 4585, or take any other action that the Director determines to be appropriate, consistent with the Safety and Soundness Act.
