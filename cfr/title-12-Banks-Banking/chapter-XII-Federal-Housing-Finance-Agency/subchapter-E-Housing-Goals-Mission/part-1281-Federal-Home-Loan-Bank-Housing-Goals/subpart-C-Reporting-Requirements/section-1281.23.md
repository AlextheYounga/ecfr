##### § 1281.23 Bank data integrity. #####

(a) *Certification.* (1) The senior officer of each Bank who is responsible for submitting the annual Mortgage Report, or for submitting any other report(s), data or other information for which certification is requested in writing by the Director, shall certify such report(s), data or information.

(2) The certification shall state as follows: “To the best of my knowledge and belief, the information provided herein is true, correct and complete.”

(b) *Adjustment to correct errors, omissions or discrepancies.* FHFA shall determine on an annual basis the official housing goals performance figures for a Bank that is subject to the housing goals. FHFA may resolve any error, omission or discrepancy by adjusting the Bank's official housing goals performance figure. If the Director determines that the year-end data reported by a Bank for a year preceding the latest year for which data on housing goals performance was reported to FHFA contained a material error, omission or discrepancy, the Director may increase the corresponding housing goal for the current year by the number of mortgages that the Director determines were overstated in the prior year's goal performance.
