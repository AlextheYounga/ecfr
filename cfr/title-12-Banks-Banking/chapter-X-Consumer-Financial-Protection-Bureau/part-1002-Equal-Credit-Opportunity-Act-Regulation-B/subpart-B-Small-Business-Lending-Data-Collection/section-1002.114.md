(1) A covered financial institution that originated at least 2,500 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of calendar years 2022 and 2023 shall comply with the requirements of this subpart beginning October 1, 2024.

(2) A covered financial institution that is not subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that originated at least 500 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of calendar years 2022 and 2023 shall comply with the requirements of this subpart beginning April 1, 2025.

(3) A covered financial institution that is not subject to paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section and that originated at least 100 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of calendar years 2022 and 2023 shall comply with the requirements of this subpart beginning January 1, 2026.

(4) A financial institution that did not originate at least 100 covered credit transactions for small businesses in each of calendar years 2022 and 2023 but subsequently originates at least 100 such transactions in two consecutive calendar years shall comply with the requirements of this subpart in accordance with § 1002.105(b), but in any case no earlier than January 1, 2026.

(c) *Special transitional rules*—(1) *Collection of certain information prior to a financial institution's compliance date.* A financial institution as described in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section is permitted, but not required, to collect information regarding whether an applicant for a covered credit transaction is a minority-owned business, a women-owned business, and/or an LGBTQI+-owned business under § 1002.107(a)(18), and the ethnicity, race, and sex of the applicant's principal owners under § 1002.107(a)(19) beginning 12 months prior to its applicable compliance date as set forth in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. A financial institution collecting such information pursuant to this paragraph (c)(1) must do so in accordance with the requirements set out in §§ 1002.107(a)(18) and (19), 1002.108, and 1002.111(b) and (c).

(2) *Determining which compliance date applies to a financial institution that does not collect information sufficient to determine small business status.* A financial institution that is unable to determine the number of covered credit transactions it originated for small businesses in each of calendar years 2022 and 2023 for purposes of determining its compliance date pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, because for some or all of this period it does not have readily accessible the information needed to determine whether its covered credit transactions were originated for small businesses as defined in § 1002.106(b), is permitted to use any reasonable method to estimate its originations to small businesses for either or both of the calendar years 2022 and 2023.
