##### § 3030.527 Calculation of unused rate adjustment authority for Type 1-C rate adjustments. #####

(a) For a notice of Type 1-C rate adjustment, unused rate adjustment authority for a class is calculated in two steps. First, the difference between the annual limitation calculated pursuant to § 3030.521 or § 3030.522 for the most recent notice of Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment and the percentage change in rates for the class calculated pursuant to § 3030.523(b)(2) is calculated. Second, the unused rate adjustment authority generated in the most recent Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment is subtracted from that result.

(b) Unused rate adjustment authority generated under paragraph (a) of this section lapses 5 years after the date of filing of the most recent notice of Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment.

(c) Unused rate adjustment authority generated under paragraph (a) of this section for a class shall be added to the unused rate adjustment authority generated in the most recent notice of Type 1-A rate adjustment on the schedule maintained under § 3030.526(f). For purposes of § 3030.528, the unused rate adjustment authority generated under paragraph (a) of this section for a class shall be deemed to have been added to the schedule maintained under § 3030.526(f) on the same date as the most recent notice of Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment.

(d) Unused rate adjustment authority generated under paragraph (a) of this section shall be subject to the limitation under § 3030.529, regardless of whether it is used alone or in combination with other existing unused rate adjustment authority.
