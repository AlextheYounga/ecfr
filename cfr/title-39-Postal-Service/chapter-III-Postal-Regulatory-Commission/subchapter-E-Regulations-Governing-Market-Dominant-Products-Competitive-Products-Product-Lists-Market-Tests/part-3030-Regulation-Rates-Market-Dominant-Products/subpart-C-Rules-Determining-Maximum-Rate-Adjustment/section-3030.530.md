(1) For each affected class, the rate increases contained within the notice of a Type 1-A rate adjustment do not result in the percentage change in rates for the class equaling or exceeding 0.001 percent; and

(2) For each affected class, the sum of all rate increases included in *de minimis* rate increases since the most recent Type 1-A, Type 1-B, or Type 3 rate adjustment that was not a *de minimis* rate increase does not result in the percentage change in rates for the class equaling or exceeding 0.001 percent.

(b) No unused rate adjustment authority will be added to the schedule of unused rate adjustment authority maintained under ยง 3030.526(f) as a result of a *de minimis* rate increase.

(1) The annual limitation shall be calculated as if the de minimis rate increase had not been filed; and

(2) For purposes of calculating the percentage change in rates, the current rate shall be the current rate from the *de minimis* rate increase.

(e) The Postal Service shall file supporting workpapers with each notice of *de minimis* rate increase that demonstrate that the sum of all rate increases included in *de minimis* rate increases since the most recent Type 1-A, Type 1-B, or Type 3 notice of rate adjustment that was not *de minimis* does not result in a *percentage* change in rates for the class equaling or exceeding 0.001 percent.
