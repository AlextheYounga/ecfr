(2) A Type 1-C rate adjustment filed immediately after a Type 3 rate adjustment (that is, with no intervening Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment) may not generate unused rate adjustment authority.

(3) The Postal Service may elect not to generate unused rate adjustment authority in a Type 1-C rate adjustment.
