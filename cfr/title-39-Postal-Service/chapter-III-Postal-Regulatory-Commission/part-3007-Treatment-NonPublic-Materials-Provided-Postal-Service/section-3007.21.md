##### ยง 3007.21 Content of the Postal Service application for non-public treatment. #####

(a) Whenever the Postal Service files non-public materials with the Commission, it must submit an application for non-public treatment that clearly identifies all non-public materials and describes the circumstances causing them to be submitted to the Commission.

(b) An application for non-public treatment is to fulfill the burden of persuasion that the non-public materials should be withheld from the public.

(c) The application for non-public treatment must include a specific and detailed statement setting forth:

(1) The rationale for claiming that the materials are non-public, including the specific statutory basis for the claim, and a statement justifying application of the provision(s);

(2) Identification, including name, phone number, and e-mail address for any third party who is known to have a proprietary interest in the materials, or if such an identification is sensitive, contact information for a Postal Service employee who shall provide notice to that third party;

(3) A description of the materials claimed to be non-public in a manner that, without revealing the materials at issue, would allow a person to thoroughly evaluate the basis for the claim that they are non-public;

(4) Particular identification of the nature and extent of commercial harm alleged and the likelihood of such harm;

(5) At least one specific hypothetical, illustrative example of each alleged harm;

(6) The extent of protection from public disclosure deemed to be necessary;

(7) The length of time deemed necessary for the non-public materials to be protected from public disclosure with justification thereof; and

(8) Any other factors or reasons relevant to support the application.
