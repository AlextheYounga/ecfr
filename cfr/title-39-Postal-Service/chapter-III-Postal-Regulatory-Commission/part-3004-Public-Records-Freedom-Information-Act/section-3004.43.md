(d) *Denying request.* If denying the request, in whole or in part, the Chief FOIA Officer or his/her designee will inform the requester in writing of:

(2) An estimate of the volume of requested matter that was denied:

(i) If disclosure of a record has been partially denied, the amount of information deleted will be indicated on the released portion if technically feasible; and

(ii) If revealing the amount or location of a denied record will harm an interest protected by an exemption, then the description of the amount or location of deleted information shall be withheld.

(3) The right to appeal the denial to the Commission within 1 year.

(e) *Expedited processing.* Within 10 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays) after receipt of a request for expedited processing, the Chief FOIA Officer or his/her designee will:

(2) Deny the request for expedited processing by informing the individual of:

(i) The denial in writing;

(ii) The right to appeal the denial to the Commission in writing; and

(iii) The procedures for appealing the denial.

(3) Any request for records that has been denied expedited processing will be processed in the same manner as a request that did not seek expedited processing.

(f) Where a compelling need is not shown in an expedited request as specified in § 3004.41(b)(1), the Commission may grant requests for expedited processing at its discretion.
