##### ยง 3015.7 Standards for compliance. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 539, Jan. 31, 2019.

For purposes of determining competitive products' compliance with 39 U.S.C. 3633, the Commission will apply the following standards:

(a) Incremental costs will be used to test for cross-subsidies by market dominant products of competitive products. To the extent that incremental cost data are unavailable, the Commission will use the sum of competitive products' volume-variable costs and product-specific costs supplemented to include causally related, group-specific costs to test for cross-subsidies.

(b) Each competitive product must recover its attributable costs as defined in 39 U.S.C. 3631(b). Pursuant to 39 U.S.C. 3631(b), the Commission will calculate a competitive product's attributable costs as the sum of its volume-variable costs, product-specific costs, and those inframarginal costs calculated as part of a competitive product's incremental costs.

(c) Annually, on a fiscal year basis, the appropriate share of institutional costs to be recovered from competitive products collectively is, at a minimum, 5.5 percent of the Postal Service's total institutional costs.
