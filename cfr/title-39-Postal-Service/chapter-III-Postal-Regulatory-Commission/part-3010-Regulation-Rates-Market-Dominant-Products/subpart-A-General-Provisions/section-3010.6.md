##### § 3010.6 Type 1-C rate adjustment - in general. #####

(a) A Type 1-C rate adjustment is an adjustment to a rate of general applicability that contains only a decrease. A rate adjustment that includes both an increase and a decrease in rates of general applicability is a Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment; it is not a Type 1-C rate adjustment.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a Type 1-C rate adjustment may generate unused rate adjustment authority, as described in § 3010.27.

(2) A Type 1-C rate adjustment filed immediately after a Type 3 rate adjustment (that is, with no intervening Type 1-A or Type 1-B rate adjustment) may not generate unused rate adjustment authority.

(3) The Postal Service may elect not to generate unused rate adjustment authority in a Type 1-C rate adjustment.
