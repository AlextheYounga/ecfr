##### ยง 3001.38 Omission of intermediate decisions. #####

(a) *Basis of omission.* In any proceeding noticed pursuant to ยง 3001.17, the Commission, on the motion of any participant or on its own initiative, may direct the certification of the record to the Commission and omit any intermediate decision upon a finding on the record that due and timely execution of its functions imperatively and unavoidably so requires. In proceedings in which all participants concur in a request by any participant that any intermediate decision be omitted, the Commission shall direct the certification of the record to the Commission and forthwith render a final decision unless the Commission denies such request within 10 days next following its filing or referral by the presiding officer.

(b) *Requests for omission.* Requests for omission of the intermediate decision in any proceeding shall be made by motion pursuant to ยง 3001.21 or made orally on the record before the presiding officer who shall promptly refer the same to the Commission. Such requests shall specify (1) the concurrence of other parties and (2) whether opportunity for filing briefs or presenting oral argument to the Commission is desired or waived. Failure of any party to object to such request shall constitute a waiver of any objections.
