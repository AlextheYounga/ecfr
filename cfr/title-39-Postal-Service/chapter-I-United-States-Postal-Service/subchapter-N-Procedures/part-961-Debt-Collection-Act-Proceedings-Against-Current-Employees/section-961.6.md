##### ยง 961.6 (Rule 6) Filing, docketing, and serving documents; computation of time; representation of parties. #####

(a) *Filing.* The Judicial Officer Department calculates all filing deadlines in Eastern Time. After a petition is filed, all documents relating to the petition must be filed using the electronic filing system, unless the Hearing Official permits otherwise. Documents submitted using the electronic filing system are considered filed as of the date and time (Eastern Time) reflected in the system. Documents mailed to the Recorder are considered filed on the date mailed. Filings by any other means are considered filed when the Recorder receives a complete copy of the filing during normal business hours. The Recorder's normal business hours are between 8:45 a.m. and 4:45 p.m., Eastern Time. Documents filed by other means after 4:45 p.m., Eastern Time, or on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, will be considered filed on the next business day.

(b) *Docketing.* The Recorder will maintain a record of Debt Collection Act petitions and will assign a docket number to each case. After notification of the docket number, the employee and the Postal Service must refer to the docket number on all further filings.

(c) *Service.* If both parties have access to the electronic filing system, separate service on the opposing party is not required. Otherwise, documents must be served personally, by mail, or by email on the opposing party, noting on the document filed, or on the transmitting letter, that a copy has been so furnished.

(d) *Time computation.* A filing period excludes the day the period begins, and includes the last day of the period, unless the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, in which case the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday. Requests for extensions of time must:

(1) Be made in writing before the date on which the submission is due;

(2) State the reason for the request;

(3) Represent that the moving party has contacted the opposing party about the request, or made reasonable efforts to do so; and

(4) Indicate whether the opposing party consents to the extension. Requests for extensions of time submitted after the date on which the submission was due must explain why the moving party was unable to request an extension before the deadline.

(e) *Representation of parties.* The Postal Service's representative, as designated by the General Counsel, must file a notice of appearance as soon as practicable, but no later than the date the answer is filed. Employees may represent themselves or be represented by an attorney or other designated person. As applicable, an employee's representative must file a notice of appearance as soon as practicable. The Postal Service must direct all further communications and documents to the employee's representative. A representative who later withdraws must file a notice that includes the name, mailing address, email address, and telephone number of the person who will assume responsibility for representing the party.
