##### § 266.8 Schedule of fees. #####

(a) *Policy.* The purpose of this section is to establish fair and equitable fees to permit duplication of records for subject individuals (or authorized representatives) while recovering the full allowable direct costs incurred by the Postal Service.

(b) *Duplication.* (1) For duplicating any paper or micrographic record or publication or computer report, the fee is $.15 per page, except that the first 100 pages furnished in response to a particular request shall be furnished without charge. See paragraph (d) of this section for fee limitations.

(2) The Postal Service may at its discretion make coin-operated copy machines available at any location. In that event, requesters will be given the opportunity to make copies at their own expense.

(3) The Postal Service normally will not furnish more than one copy of any record. If duplicate copies are furnished at the request of the requester, $.15 per page fee is charged for each copy of each duplicate page without regard to whether the requester is eligible for free copies pursuant to § 266.8(b)(1).

(c) *Aggregating requests.* When the custodian reasonably believes that a requester is attempting to break a request for similar types of records down into a series of requests in order to evade the assessment of fees, the custodian may aggregate the requests and charge accordingly.

(d) *Limitations.* No fee will be charged an individual for the process of retrieving, reviewing, or amending a record pertaining to that individual.

(e) The Postal Service may, at its discretion, require reimbursement of its costs as a condition of participation in a computer matching program or activity with another agency. The agency to be charged is notified in writing of the approximate costs before they are incurred. Costs are calculated in accordance with the schedule of fees at § 265.9.
