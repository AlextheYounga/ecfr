##### ยง 265.1 General provisions. #####

(a) This subpart contains the regulations that implement the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552, insofar as the Act applies to the Postal Service. These rules should be read in conjunction with the text of the FOIA and the *Uniform Freedom of Information Fee Schedule and Guidelines* published by the Office of Management and Budget, (OMB Guidelines), 52 FR 10012 (Mar. 27, 1987). The *Postal Service FOIA Requester's Guide,* an easy-to-read guide for making Postal Service FOIA requests, is available at *http://about.usps.com/who-we-are/foia/welcome.htm.*

(b) Requests made by individuals for records about themselves under the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. 552a, are processed under Part 266 as well as under this subpart.

(c) It is the policy of the Postal Service to make its official records available to the public to the maximum extent consistent with the public interest. This policy requires a practice of full disclosure of those records that are covered by the requirements of the FOIA, subject only to the specific exemptions required or authorized by law. The exemptions from mandatory disclosure for various types of records provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(b) and 39 U.S.C. 410(c) reflect the fact that under some circumstances, the public interest may be better served by leaving the disclosure of particular records to the discretion of the Postal Service rather than by requiring their disclosure. This Postal Service policy does not create any right enforceable in court.

(d) As referenced in this subpart, *component* means any department or facility within the Postal Service that maintains records; the Office of Inspector General; and the Postal Inspection Service. *Postal Service* refers to all such components collectively.

(e) Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to entitle any person, as of right, to any service or to the disclosure of any record to which such person is not entitled under the FOIA.
