##### ยง 1.20 Purpose and scope of regulation. #####

The regulations in this subpart are issued to implement the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). The regulations apply to all records which are contained in systems of records maintained by the Department of the Treasury and which are retrieved by an individual's name or personal identifier. They do not relate to those personnel records of Government employees, which are under the jurisdiction of the Office of Personnel Management to the extent such records are subject to regulations issued by such OPM. The regulations apply to all components of the Department of the Treasury. Any reference in this subpart to the Department or its officials, employees, or records shall be deemed to refer also to the components or their officials, employees, or records. The regulations set forth the requirements applicable to Department of the Treasury employees maintaining, collecting, using or disseminating records pertaining to individuals. They also set forth the procedures by which individuals may request notification of whether the Department of the Treasury maintains or has disclosed a record pertaining to them or may seek access to such records maintained in any nonexempt system of records, request correction of such records, appeal any initial adverse determination of any request for amendment, or may seek an accounting of disclosures of such records. For the convenience of interested persons, the components of the Department of the Treasury may reprint these regulations in their entirety (less any appendices not applicable to the component in question) in those titles of the Code of Federal Regulations which normally contain regulations applicable to such components. In connection with such republication, and at other appropriate times, components may issue supplementary regulations applicable only to the component in question, which are consistent with these regulations. In the event of any actual or apparent inconsistency, these Departmental regulations shall govern. Persons interested in the records of a particular component should, therefore, also consult the Code of Federal Regulations for any rules or regulations promulgated specifically with respect to that component (see Appendices to this subpart for cross references). The head of each component is hereby also authorized to substitute other appropriate officials for those designated and correct addresses specified in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the component.
