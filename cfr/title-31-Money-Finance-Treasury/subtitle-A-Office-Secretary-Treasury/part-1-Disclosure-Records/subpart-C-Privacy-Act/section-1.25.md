##### § 1.25 Accounting of disclosures. #####

(a) *Accounting of certain disclosures.* Each component, with respect to each system of records under its control, shall:

(1) Keep an accurate accounting of: (i) The date, nature, and purpose of each disclosure of a record to any person or to an agency made under 5 U.S.C. 552a (b) and § 1.24; and (ii) the name and address of the person or agency to whom the disclosure is made;

(2) Retain the accounting made under paragraph (a)(1) of this section for at least five years or the life of the record, whichever is longer, after the disclosure for which the accounting is made; and

(3) Inform any person or other agency about any correction or notation of dispute made by the constitutent unit in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a (d) and § 1.28 of any record that has been disclosed to the person or agency if an accounting of the disclosure was made. (See 5 U.S.C. 552(c).)

(b) *Accounting systems.* To permit the accounting required by paragraph (a) of this section, system managers, with the approval of the head of their offices within a component, shall establish or implement, a system of accounting for all disclosures of records, either orally or in writing, made outside the Department of the Treasury. Accounting records shall:

(1) Be established in the least expensive and most convenient form that will permit the system manager to advise individuals, promptly upon request, what records concerning them have been disclosed and to whom:

(2) Provide, as a minimum, the identification of the particular record disclosed, the name and address of the person or agency to whom or to whom or to which disclosed, and the date, nature and purpose of the disclosure; and

(3) Be maintained for 5 years or until the record is destroyed or transferred to the National Archives and Records Service for storage in records centers, in which event, the accounting pertaining to those records, unless maintained separately, shall be transferred with the records themselves.

(c) *Exemptions from accounting requirements.* No accounting is required for disclosure of records:

(1) To those officers and employees of the Department of the Treasury who have a need for the record in the performance of their duties; or

(2) If disclosure would be required under 5 U.S.C. 552 and Subpart A of this part.

(d) *Access to accounting by individual.* (1) Subject to paragraphs (c) and (d)(2) of this section, each component shall establish and set forth in the appendix to this subpart applicable to the component, procedures for making the accounting required under paragraph (a) of this section available to the individual to whom the record pertains and shall thereafter make such accounting available in accordance therewith at the request of the individual. The procedures may require the requester to provide reasonable identification.

(2) Access accountings of disclosure may be withheld from the individual named in the record only if the disclosures were (i) made under 5 U.S.C. 552a (b)(7) and § 1.24 (a)(7), or (ii) under a system of records exempted from the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552 (j) or (k) and § 1.23(c).
