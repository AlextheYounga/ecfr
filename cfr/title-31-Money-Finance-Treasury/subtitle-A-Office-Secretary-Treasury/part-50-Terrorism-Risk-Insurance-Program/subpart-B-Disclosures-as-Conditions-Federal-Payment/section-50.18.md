(2) The insurer provided notice at least 30 days before any such reinstatement of the increased premium for such terrorism coverage and the rights of the insured with respect to such coverage, including the date upon which the exclusion would be reinstated if no payment is received, and the insured fails to pay any increased premium charged by the insurer for providing such terrorism coverage.
