(3) The adjustment factors for terrorism loss risk-spreading premiums described in section 103(e)(8)(D) of the Act;

(4) The annual 3 percent limitation on terrorism loss risk-spreading premiums collected on a discretionary basis as provided in section 103(e)(8)(C) of the Act;

(5) A preferred minimum initial assessment period of one full year and subsequent extension periods in full year increments;

(6) The collection timing requirements of section 103(e)(7)(E) of the Act;
