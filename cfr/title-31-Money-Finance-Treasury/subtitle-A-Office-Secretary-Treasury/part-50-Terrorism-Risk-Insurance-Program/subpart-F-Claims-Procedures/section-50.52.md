##### § 50.52 Initial Notice of Insured Loss. #####

Each insurer shall submit to Treasury an Initial Notice of Insured Loss, on a form prescribed by Treasury, whenever the insurer's aggregate insured losses (including reserves for “incurred but not reported” losses) within a Program Year exceed an amount equal to 50 percent of the insurer's deductible as specified in § 50.5(g). Insurers are advised the form for the Initial Notice of Insured Loss will include an initial estimate of aggregate losses for the Program Year, the amount of the insurer deductible and an estimate of the Federal share of compensation for the insurer's aggregate insured losses. In the case of an affiliated group of insurers, the form for the Initial Notice of Insured Loss will include the name and address of a single designated insurer within the affiliated group that will serve as the single point of contact for the purpose of providing loss and compliance certifications as required in § 50.53 and for receiving, disbursing, and distributing payments of the Federal share of compensation in accordance with § 50.54. An insurer, at its option, may elect to include with its Initial Notice of Insured Loss the certification of direct earned premium required by § 50.53(b)(3).
