(6) See ยง 50.55 of this part for determination of an insurer's affiliates for purposes of subpart F.

(d) *Aggregate Federal share of compensation* means the aggregate amount paid by Treasury for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses in a Program Year.

(e) *Assessment period* means a period, established by Treasury, during which policyholders of property and casualty insurance policies must pay, and insurers must collect, the Federal Terrorism Policy Surcharge for remittance to Treasury.

(f) *Direct earned premium* means direct earned premium for all commercial property and casualty insurance issued by any insurer for insurance against all losses, including losses from an act of terrorism, occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.

(1) *State licensed or admitted insurers.* For a State licensed or admitted insurer that reports to the NAIC, direct earned premium is the premium information for commercial property and casualty insurance reported by the insurer on column 2 of the NAIC Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement (commonly known as Statutory Page 14). (*See* definition of property and casualty insurance.)

(i) Premium information as reported to the NAIC should be included in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program only to the extent it reflects premiums for commercial property and casualty insurance issued by the insurer against losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.

(ii) Premiums for personal property and casualty insurance (insurance primarily designed to cover personal, family or household risk exposures, with the exception of insurance written to insure 1 to 4 family rental dwellings owned for the business purpose of generating income for the property owner), or premiums for any other insurance coverage that does not meet the definition of commercial property and casualty insurance, should be excluded in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program.

(iii) Personal property and casualty insurance coverage that includes incidental coverage for commercial purposes is primarily personal coverage, and therefore premiums may be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of the Program, commercial coverage is incidental if less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium is attributable to commercial coverage. Commercial property and casualty insurance against losses occurring at locations other than the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, or other insurance coverage that does not meet the definition of commercial property and casualty insurance, but that includes incidental coverage for commercial risk exposures at such locations, is primarily not commercial property and casualty insurance, and therefore premiums for such insurance may also be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of this section, commercial property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act is incidental if less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium for the insurance policy is attributable to coverage at such locations. Also for purposes of this section, coverage for commercial risk exposures is incidental if it is combined with coverages that otherwise do not meet the definition of commercial property and casualty insurance and less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium for the insurance policy is attributable to the coverage for commercial risk exposures.

(iv) If a property and casualty insurance policy covers both commercial and personal risk exposures, insurers may allocate the premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk between commercial and personal components in order to ascertain direct earned premium. If a policy includes insurance coverage that meets the definition of commercial property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, but also includes other coverage, insurers may allocate the premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk attributable to the components in order to ascertain direct earned premium.

(2) *Insurers that do not report to NAIC.* An insurer that does not report to the NAIC, but that is licensed or admitted by any State (such as certain farm or county mutual insurers), should use the guidance provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section to assist in ascertaining its direct earned premium.

(i) Direct earned premium may be ascertained by adjusting data maintained by such insurer or reported by such insurer to its State regulator to reflect a breakdown of premiums for commercial and personal property and casualty exposure risk as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and, if necessary, re-stated to reflect the accrual method of determining direct earned premium versus direct premium.

(ii) Such an insurer should consider other types of payments that compensate the insurer for risk of loss (contributions, assessments, etc.) as part of its direct earned premium.

(3) *Certain eligible surplus line carrier insurers.* An eligible surplus line carrier insurer listed on the NAIC Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers must ascertain its direct earned premium as follows:

(i) For policies that were in-force as of November 26, 2002, or entered into prior to January 1, 2003, direct earned premiums are to be determined with reference to the definition of property and casualty insurance and the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act by allocating the appropriate portion of premium income for losses for property and casualty insurance at such locations. The same allocation methodologies contained within the NAIC's โAllocation of Surplus Lines and Independently Procured Insurance Premium Tax on Multi-State Risks Model Regulationโ for allocating premium between coverage for property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act and all other coverage, to ascertain the appropriate percentage of premium income to be included in direct earned premium, may be used.

(ii) For policies issued after January 1, 2003, premium for insurance that meets the definition of property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, must be priced separately by such eligible surplus line carriers.

(4) *Federally approved insurers.* A federally approved insurer under section 102(6)(A)(iii) of the Act should use a methodology similar to that specified for eligible surplus line carrier insurers in paragraph (f)(3) of this section to calculate its direct earned premium. Such calculation should be adjusted to reflect the limitations on scope of insurance coverage under the Program (*i.e.*, to the extent of federal approval of commercial property and casualty insurance in connection with maritime, energy or aviation activities).

(g) *Direct written premium* means the premium information for commercial property and casualty insurance as defined in paragraph (u) of this section that is included by an insurer in column 1 of the Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement or in an equivalent reporting requirement. The Federal Terrorism Policy Surcharge is not included in amounts reported as direct written premium.

(h) *Discretionary recoupment amount* means such amount of the aggregate Federal share of compensation in excess of the mandatory recoupment amount that the Secretary has determined will be recouped pursuant to section 103(e)(7)(D) of the Act.

(i) *Federal Terrorism Policy Surcharge* means the amount established by Treasury under section 103(e)(8) of the Act which is imposed as a policy surcharge on property and casualty insurance policies, expressed as a percentage of the written premium.

(j) *Insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount* means an amount for a Program Year as set forth in section 103(e)(6) of the Act. For any Program Year beginning with 2008 through 2014, such amount is the lesser of $27,500,000,000 and the aggregate amount, for all insurers, of insured losses from Program Trigger Events during the Program Year.

(k) *Insured loss.* (1) The term insured loss means any loss resulting from an act of terrorism (including an act of war, in the case of workers' compensation) that is covered by primary or excess property and casualty insurance issued by an insurer if the loss:

(i) Occurs within the United States;

(ii) Occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102), to a United States flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States), regardless of where the loss occurs; or

(iii) Occurs at the premises of any United States mission.

(2)(i) A loss that occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102), to a United States flag vessel, or a vessel based principally in the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States, is not an insured loss under section 102(5)(B) of the Act unless it is incurred by the air carrier or vessel outside the United States.

(ii) An insured loss to an air carrier or vessel outside the United States under section 102(5)(B) of the Act does not include losses covered by third party insurance contracts that are separate from the insurance coverage provided to the air carrier or vessel.

(3) The term insured loss includes reasonable loss adjustment expenses, incurred by an insurer in connection with insured losses, that are allocated and identified by claim file in insurer records, including expenses incurred in the investigation, adjustment and defense of claims, but excluding staff salaries, overhead, and other insurer expenses that would have been incurred notwithstanding the insured loss.

(4) The term insured loss does not include:

(i) Punitive or exemplary damages awarded or paid in connection with the Federal cause of action specified in section 107(a)(1) of the Act. The term โpunitive or exemplary damagesโ means damages that are not compensatory but are an award of money made to a claimant solely to punish or deter; or

(ii) Extra contractual damages awarded against, or paid by, an insurer; or

(iii) Payments by an insurer in excess of policy limits.

(*1*) Have gone through a process of being licensed or admitted to engage in the business of providing primary or excess insurance that is administered by the State's insurance regulator, which process generally applies to insurance companies or is similar in scope and content to the process applicable to insurance companies;

(*3*) Be managed independently from other insurers participating in the Program;

(n) *Mandatory recoupment amount* means the difference between the insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount for a Program Year and the uncompensated insured losses during such Program Year.
