(i) If an insurer controls another insurer under any State law, and at least one of the factors listed in paragraph (c) (4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer that has control under State law exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the other insurer for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.

(ii) If an insurer provides 25 percent or more of another insurer's capital (in the case of a stock insurer), policyholder surplus (in the case of a mutual insurer), or corporate capital (in the case of other entities that qualify as insurers), and at least one of the factors listed in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section applies, there is a rebuttable presumption that the insurer providing such capital, policyholder surplus, or corporate capital exercises a controlling influence over the management or policies of the receiving insurer for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.

(F) The insurer has the power to direct the disposition of more than 25 percent of a class of voting stock of the other insurer in a manner other than a widely dispersed or public offering;

(G) The insurer and/or the insurer's representative or nominee constitute more than one member of the other insurer's board of directors; or

(6) See § 50.55 of this part for determination of an insurer's affiliates for purposes of subpart F.

(d) *Aggregate Federal share of compensation* means the aggregate amount paid by Treasury for the Federal share of compensation for insured losses in a Program Year.

(e) *Assessment period* means a period, established by Treasury, during which policyholders of property and casualty insurance policies must pay, and insurers must collect, the Federal Terrorism Policy Surcharge for remittance to Treasury.

(f) *Direct earned premium* means direct earned premium for all commercial property and casualty insurance issued by any insurer for insurance against all losses, including losses from an act of terrorism, occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.

(1) *State licensed or admitted insurers.* For a State licensed or admitted insurer that reports to the NAIC, direct earned premium is the premium information for commercial property and casualty insurance reported by the insurer on column 2 of the NAIC Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement (commonly known as Statutory Page 14). (*See* definition of property and casualty insurance.)

(i) Premium information as reported to the NAIC should be included in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program only to the extent it reflects premiums for commercial property and casualty insurance issued by the insurer against losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act.

(ii) Premiums for personal property and casualty insurance (insurance primarily designed to cover personal, family or household risk exposures, with the exception of insurance written to insure 1 to 4 family rental dwellings owned for the business purpose of generating income for the property owner), or premiums for any other insurance coverage that does not meet the definition of commercial property and casualty insurance, should be excluded in the calculation of direct earned premiums for purposes of the Program.

(iii) Personal property and casualty insurance coverage that includes incidental coverage for commercial purposes is primarily personal coverage, and therefore premiums may be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of the Program, commercial coverage is incidental if less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium is attributable to commercial coverage. Commercial property and casualty insurance against losses occurring at locations other than the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, or other insurance coverage that does not meet the definition of commercial property and casualty insurance, but that includes incidental coverage for commercial risk exposures at such locations, is primarily not commercial property and casualty insurance, and therefore premiums for such insurance may also be fully excluded by an insurer from the calculation of direct earned premium. For purposes of this section, commercial property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act is incidental if less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium for the insurance policy is attributable to coverage at such locations. Also for purposes of this section, coverage for commercial risk exposures is incidental if it is combined with coverages that otherwise do not meet the definition of commercial property and casualty insurance and less than 25 percent of the total direct earned premium for the insurance policy is attributable to the coverage for commercial risk exposures.

(iv) If a property and casualty insurance policy covers both commercial and personal risk exposures, insurers may allocate the premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk between commercial and personal components in order to ascertain direct earned premium. If a policy includes insurance coverage that meets the definition of commercial property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, but also includes other coverage, insurers may allocate the premiums in accordance with the proportion of risk attributable to the components in order to ascertain direct earned premium.

(2) *Insurers that do not report to NAIC.* An insurer that does not report to the NAIC, but that is licensed or admitted by any State (such as certain farm or county mutual insurers), should use the guidance provided in paragraph (f)(1) of this section to assist in ascertaining its direct earned premium.

(i) Direct earned premium may be ascertained by adjusting data maintained by such insurer or reported by such insurer to its State regulator to reflect a breakdown of premiums for commercial and personal property and casualty exposure risk as described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section and, if necessary, re-stated to reflect the accrual method of determining direct earned premium versus direct premium.

(ii) Such an insurer should consider other types of payments that compensate the insurer for risk of loss (contributions, assessments, etc.) as part of its direct earned premium.

(3) *Certain eligible surplus line carrier insurers.* An eligible surplus line carrier insurer listed on the NAIC Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers must ascertain its direct earned premium as follows:

(i) For policies that were in-force as of November 26, 2002, or entered into prior to January 1, 2003, direct earned premiums are to be determined with reference to the definition of property and casualty insurance and the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act by allocating the appropriate portion of premium income for losses for property and casualty insurance at such locations. The same allocation methodologies contained within the NAIC's “Allocation of Surplus Lines and Independently Procured Insurance Premium Tax on Multi-State Risks Model Regulation” for allocating premium between coverage for property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act and all other coverage, to ascertain the appropriate percentage of premium income to be included in direct earned premium, may be used.

(ii) For policies issued after January 1, 2003, premium for insurance that meets the definition of property and casualty insurance for losses occurring at the locations described in section 102(5)(A) and (B) of the Act, must be priced separately by such eligible surplus line carriers.

(4) *Federally approved insurers.* A federally approved insurer under section 102(6)(A)(iii) of the Act should use a methodology similar to that specified for eligible surplus line carrier insurers in paragraph (f)(3) of this section to calculate its direct earned premium. Such calculation should be adjusted to reflect the limitations on scope of insurance coverage under the Program (*i.e.*, to the extent of federal approval of commercial property and casualty insurance in connection with maritime, energy or aviation activities).

(g) *Direct written premium* means the premium information for commercial property and casualty insurance as defined in paragraph (u) of this section that is included by an insurer in column 1 of the Exhibit of Premiums and Losses of the NAIC Annual Statement or in an equivalent reporting requirement. The Federal Terrorism Policy Surcharge is not included in amounts reported as direct written premium.

(h) *Discretionary recoupment amount* means such amount of the aggregate Federal share of compensation in excess of the mandatory recoupment amount that the Secretary has determined will be recouped pursuant to section 103(e)(7)(D) of the Act.

(i) *Federal Terrorism Policy Surcharge* means the amount established by Treasury under section 103(e)(8) of the Act which is imposed as a policy surcharge on property and casualty insurance policies, expressed as a percentage of the written premium.

(j) *Insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount* means an amount for a Program Year as set forth in section 103(e)(6) of the Act. For any Program Year beginning with 2008 through 2014, such amount is the lesser of $27,500,000,000 and the aggregate amount, for all insurers, of insured losses from Program Trigger Events during the Program Year.

(k) *Insured loss.* (1) The term insured loss means any loss resulting from an act of terrorism (including an act of war, in the case of workers' compensation) that is covered by primary or excess property and casualty insurance issued by an insurer if the loss:

(i) Occurs within the United States;

(ii) Occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102), to a United States flag vessel (or a vessel based principally in the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States), regardless of where the loss occurs; or

(iii) Occurs at the premises of any United States mission.

(2)(i) A loss that occurs to an air carrier (as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102), to a United States flag vessel, or a vessel based principally in the United States, on which United States income tax is paid and whose insurance coverage is subject to regulation in the United States, is not an insured loss under section 102(5)(B) of the Act unless it is incurred by the air carrier or vessel outside the United States.

(ii) An insured loss to an air carrier or vessel outside the United States under section 102(5)(B) of the Act does not include losses covered by third party insurance contracts that are separate from the insurance coverage provided to the air carrier or vessel.

(3) The term insured loss includes reasonable loss adjustment expenses, incurred by an insurer in connection with insured losses, that are allocated and identified by claim file in insurer records, including expenses incurred in the investigation, adjustment and defense of claims, but excluding staff salaries, overhead, and other insurer expenses that would have been incurred notwithstanding the insured loss.

(4) The term insured loss does not include:

(i) Punitive or exemplary damages awarded or paid in connection with the Federal cause of action specified in section 107(a)(1) of the Act. The term “punitive or exemplary damages” means damages that are not compensatory but are an award of money made to a claimant solely to punish or deter; or

(ii) Extra contractual damages awarded against, or paid by, an insurer; or

(iii) Payments by an insurer in excess of policy limits.

(l) *Insurer* means any entity, including any affiliate of the entity, that meets the following requirements:

(1)(i) The entity must fall within at least one of the following categories:

(A) It is licensed or admitted to engage in the business of providing primary or excess insurance in any State, (including, but not limited to, State licensed captive insurance companies, State licensed or admitted risk retention groups, and State licensed or admitted farm and county mutuals), and, if a joint underwriting association, pooling arrangement, or other similar entity, then the entity must:

(*1*) Have gone through a process of being licensed or admitted to engage in the business of providing primary or excess insurance that is administered by the State's insurance regulator, which process generally applies to insurance companies or is similar in scope and content to the process applicable to insurance companies;

(*2*) Be generally subject to State insurance regulation, including financial reporting requirements, applicable to insurance companies within the State; and

(*3*) Be managed independently from other insurers participating in the Program;

(B) It is not licensed or admitted to engage in the business of providing primary or excess insurance in any State, but is an eligible surplus line carrier listed on the Quarterly Listing of Alien Insurers of the NAIC, or any successor to the NAIC;

(C) It is approved or accepted for the purpose of offering property and casualty insurance by a Federal agency in connection with maritime, energy, or aviation activity, but only to the extent of such federal approval of commercial property and casualty insurance coverage offered by the insurer in connection with maritime, energy, or aviation activity;

(D) It is a State residual market insurance entity or State workers' compensation fund; or

(E) As determined by the Secretary, it falls within any other class or type of captive insurer or other self-insurance arrangement by a municipality or other entity, to the extent provided in Treasury regulations issued under section 103(f) of the Act.

(ii) If an entity falls within more than one category described in paragraph (f)(1)(i) of this section, the entity is considered to fall within the first category within which it falls for purposes of the Program.

(i) State residual market insurance entities and State workers' compensation funds, to the extent provided in Treasury regulations; and

(2) For an insurer that has not had a full year of operations during the calendar year immediately preceding the applicable Program Year, the insurer deductible will be based on data for direct earned premiums for the applicable Program Year multiplied by the specified percentage for the insurer deductible for the applicable Program Year. If the insurer does not have a full year of operations during the applicable Program Year, the direct earned premiums for the applicable Program Year will be annualized to determine the insurer deductible.

(n) *Mandatory recoupment amount* means the difference between the insurance marketplace aggregate retention amount for a Program Year and the uncompensated insured losses during such Program Year.
