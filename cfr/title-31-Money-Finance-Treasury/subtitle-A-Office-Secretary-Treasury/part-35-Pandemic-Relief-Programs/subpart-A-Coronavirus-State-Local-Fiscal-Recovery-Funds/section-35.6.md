(3) If the recipient makes a one-time election to adjust general revenue to reflect tax changes made during the period beginning on January 27, 2020 and ending on January 6, 2022, for purposes of each calculation date identified in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section:

(i) In the case of any change made during such prior period to any law, regulation, or administrative interpretation that reduces any tax (by providing for a reduction in a rate, a rebate, a deduction, a credit, or otherwise) or delays the imposition of any tax or tax increase and that the recipient assesses has had the effect of decreasing the amount of tax revenue collected during the 12-month period ending on the calculation date relative to the amount of tax revenue that would have been collected in the absence of such change, the recipient must add to actual general revenue the amount of such decrease in tax revenue; and

(ii) In the case of any change made during such prior period to any law, regulation, or administrative interpretation that increases any tax (by providing for an increase in a rate, the reduction of a rebate, a deduction, or a credit, or otherwise) or accelerates the imposition of any tax or tax increase and that the recipient assesses has had the effect of increasing the amount of tax revenue collected during the 12-month period ending on the calculation date relative to the amount of tax revenue that would have been collected in the absence of such change, the recipient must subtract from actual general revenue the amount of such increase in tax revenue; and

(4) With respect to any calculation date during the period beginning on January 6, 2022 and ending on March 31, 2022, if the recipient makes the election in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the recipient must also make the adjustments referenced in paragraph (d)(3) of this section with respect to any such changes in law, regulation, or administrative interpretation during the period beginning on January 6, 2022 and ending on such calculation date.
