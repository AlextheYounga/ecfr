##### § 583.412 Entities of which one or more blocked persons is a member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or otherwise exercises control. #####

(a) The property and interests in property of an entity, including any political subdivision, agency, or instrumentality of a governmental entity, are not blocked solely because one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 583.201 is a member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or otherwise exercises control.

Note 1 to paragraph (a):

*See* § 583.411 concerning the blocked status of property and interests in property of an entity that is directly or indirectly owned, whether individually or in the aggregate, 50 percent or more by one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 583.201.

(b) For example, U.S. persons may not, except as authorized or exempt pursuant to this part, engage in the following transactions with a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 583.201: enter into contracts that are signed by a blocked person, enter into negotiations with a blocked person, or process transactions, directly or indirectly, on behalf of a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 583.201. However, U.S. persons are not prohibited from engaging in a routine interaction with an agency in which a blocked person is an official, but which does not involve the blocked person directly or indirectly.

Note 2 to § 583.412:

OFAC encourages U.S. persons to be cautious in engaging in transactions with any entity of which a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 583.201 is a member, leader, official, senior executive officer, or otherwise exercises control to ensure that U.S. persons are not engaged in transactions, directly or indirectly, with a blocked person, except as authorized or exempt pursuant to this part.
