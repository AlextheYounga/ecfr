##### ยง 570.406 Entities owned by a person whose property and interests in property are blocked. #####

A person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to ยง 570.201 has an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which it owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to ยง 570.201, regardless of whether the entity itself is listed in the Annex or designated pursuant to Executive Order 13566.

This section, which deals with the consequences of ownership of entities, in no way limits section 570.304's definition of the term *Government of Libya.*
