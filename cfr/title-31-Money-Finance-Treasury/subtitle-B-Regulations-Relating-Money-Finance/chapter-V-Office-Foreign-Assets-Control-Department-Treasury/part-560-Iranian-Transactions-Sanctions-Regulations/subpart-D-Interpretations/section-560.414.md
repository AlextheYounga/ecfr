Note 2 to § 560.414:

A reexportation of U.S.-origin goods or technology which meets the conditions of paragraph (a) of this section, or which is not within the scope of § 560.205, nevertheless may require specific authorization by other agencies of the U.S. Government for reexportation to Iran or the Government of Iran. For example, items which meet the conditions of paragraph (a) may nevertheless require an export license under the End User and End Use Control Policies found in provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR part 744).
