Note 1 to § 560.304:

The names of persons that the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has determined fall within this definition are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into one of two lists maintained by OFAC. First, the names of persons identified as blocked solely pursuant to Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012 (“Blocking Property of the Government Iran and Iranian Financial Institutions”) (E.O. 13599) and § 560.211 because they meet the definition of the term “Government of Iran” are incorporated into the “List of Persons Identified as Blocked Solely Pursuant to Executive Order 13599”) (E.O. 13599 List). The E.O. 13599 List is accessible through the following page on OFAC's Web site: *www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/13599\_list.aspx.* Second, the names of persons identified as blocked pursuant to E.O. 13599 and § 560.211 who are also blocked pursuant to one or more other parts of this chapter are incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) with the identifier “[IRAN]” as well as the relevant identifier(s) for the other sanctions program(s) pursuant to which the persons' property and interests in property are blocked. The SDN List is accessible through the following page on the OFAC's Web site: *www.treasury.gov/sdn.* However, the property and interests in property of persons falling within the definition of the term *Government of Iran* are blocked pursuant to § 560.211 regardless of whether the names of such persons are published in the Federal Register or incorporated into the E.O. 13599 List or the SDN List.

Note 2 to § 560.304:

Section 501.807 of this chapter describes the procedures to be followed by persons seeking administrative reconsideration of OFAC's determination that they fall within the definition of the term *Government of Iran.*
