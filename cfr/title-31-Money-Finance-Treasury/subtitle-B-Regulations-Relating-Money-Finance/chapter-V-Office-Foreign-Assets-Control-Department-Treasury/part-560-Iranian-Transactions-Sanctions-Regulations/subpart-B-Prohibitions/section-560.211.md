Note 1 to paragraphs (a) through (c) of § 560.211:

The names of persons identified by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as blocked solely pursuant to Executive Order 13599 of February 5, 2012 (“Blocking Property of the Government Iran and Iranian Financial Institutions”) (E.O. 13599) because they meet the definition of the terms “Government of Iran” or “Iranian financial institution,” whose property and interests in property therefore are blocked pursuant to this section, are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into the “List of Persons Identified as Blocked Solely Pursuant to Executive Order 13599”) (E.O. 13599 List). The E.O. 13599 List is accessible through the following page on OFAC's Web site: *www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/13599\_list.aspx.* The names of persons identified as blocked or designated for blocking pursuant to both this part and one or more other parts of this chapter are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) with the identifier “[IRAN]” as well as the relevant identifier(s) for the other sanctions program(s) pursuant to which the persons' property and interests in property are blocked. The SDN List is accessible through the following page on OFAC's Web site: *www.treasury.gov/sdn.* Additional information pertaining to the E.O. 13599 List and the SDN List can be found in appendix A to this chapter. *See* § 560.425 concerning entities that may not be listed on the E.O. 13599 List or on the SDN List but whose property and interests in property are nevertheless blocked pursuant to this section. E.O. 13599 blocks the property and interests in property of the Government of Iran and Iranian financial institutions as defined in §§ 560.304 and 560.324, respectively. The property and interests in property of persons falling within the definition of the terms *Government of Iran* and *Iranian financial institution* are blocked pursuant to this section regardless of whether the names of such persons are published in the Federal Register or incorporated into the E.O. 13599 List or the SDN List.

Note 2 to paragraphs (a) through (c) of § 560.211:

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701-1706), in section 203 (50 U.S.C. 1702), authorizes the blocking of property and interests in property of a person during the pendency of an investigation. The names of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pending investigation pursuant to this section also are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into the E.O. 13599 List or the SDN List, as appropriate, with the identifier “[BPI-IRAN].”

(d) The prohibitions in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section include, but are not limited to, prohibitions on the following transactions:

(2) The receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.

(e) Unless authorized by this part or by a specific license expressly referring to this section, any dealing in any security (or evidence thereof) held within the possession or control of a U.S. person and either registered or inscribed in the name of, or known to be held for the benefit of, or issued by, the Government of Iran, an Iranian financial institution, or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this section is prohibited. This prohibition includes but is not limited to the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any such security on or after the effective date. This prohibition applies irrespective of the fact that at any time (whether prior to, on, or subsequent to the effective date) the registered or inscribed owner of any such security may have or might appear to have assigned, transferred, or otherwise disposed of the security.

(f) The prohibitions in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section apply except to the extent transactions are authorized by regulations, orders, directives, rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise, and notwithstanding any contracts entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date.
