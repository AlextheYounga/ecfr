Section 8(c) of the Act also authorizes the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as appropriate, to enforce the penalty provisions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section and to enforce the laws and regulations governing exports of rough diamonds, including with respect to the validation of the Kimberley Process Certificate by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. The Office of Foreign Assets Control civil penalty procedures set forth below are separate from, and independent of, any penalty procedures that may be followed by the U.S. Bureau of Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in their exercise of the authorities set forth in section 8(c) of the Clean Diamond Trade Act.
