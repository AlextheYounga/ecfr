##### § 542.411 Entities owned by a person whose property and interests in property are blocked. #####

A person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 542.201(a) has an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which it owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 542.201(a), regardless of whether the entity itself is listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13572, the Annex to Executive Order 13573, or the Annex to Executive Order 13606, or designated pursuant to § 542.201(a).

Note to § 542.411:

This section, which deals with the consequences of ownership of entities, in no way limits the definition of the Government of Syria in § 542.305, which includes within its definition other persons whose property and interests in property are blocked but who are not on the SDN list.
