##### § 537.529 Exportation or reexportation of financial services to Burma authorized. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)-(d) of this section, the exportation or reexportation of financial services to Burma, directly or indirectly, from the United States or by a U.S. person, wherever located, is authorized.

(b) This section does not authorize, in connection with the provision of security services, the exportation or reexportation of financial services, directly or indirectly, to the Burmese Ministry of Defense, including the Office of Procurement; any state or non-state armed group; or any entity in which any of the foregoing own a 50 percent or greater interest.

(c) This section does not authorize the exportation or reexportation of financial services, directly or indirectly, to any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 537.201(a), except as set forth in § 537.404(b).

Note to § 537.529(c):

*See* § 537.531 for a general license authorizing transactions involving certain Burmese financial institutions whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 537.201(a), including establishing and maintaining accounts on the books of U.S. financial institutions.

(d) This section does not authorize any debit to a blocked account.

Note to § 537.529:

As a result of the authorization contained in this section, the special measures against Burma imposed under Section 311 of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of 2001 (Pub. L. 107-56) (USA PATRIOT Act) do not apply to the operation of correspondent accounts for Burmese financial institutions, or to transactions that are conducted through those accounts, provided the Burmese financial institution is not an entity whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 537.201(a) and the transactions are otherwise authorized by this part, and therefore fall within the exception set forth in 31 CFR 1010.651(b)(3). In addition, section 537.531 of this part authorizes certain transactions involving specific Burmese financial institutions whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this part. This section does not affect any obligation of U.S. financial institutions processing such transactions to conduct enhanced due diligence under Section 312 of the USA PATRIOT Act. *See* 31 CFR 1010.610(c).
