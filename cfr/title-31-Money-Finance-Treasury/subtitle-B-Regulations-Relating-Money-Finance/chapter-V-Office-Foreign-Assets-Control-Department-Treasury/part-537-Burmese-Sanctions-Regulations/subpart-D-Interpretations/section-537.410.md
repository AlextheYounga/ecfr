##### ยง 537.410 Contracts and subcontracts regarding economic development of resources in Burma. #####

Section 537.204 prohibits new investment in Burma by U.S. persons. However, pursuant to ยง 537.530, U.S. persons may engage in new investment in Burma, provided that all conditions of that general license are satisfied. Section 537.311 defines the term *new investment* to include certain contracts providing for the general supervision and guarantee of another person's performance of a contract that includes the economic development of resources located in Burma. With respect to entry into such contracts, only the following will be considered new investment in Burma:

(a) Entry into contracts for supervision and guarantee at the highest level of project management, such as entry into a contract with a development project's sponsor or owner to become a prime contractor or general manager for a development project;

(b) Entry into subcontracts where the functional scope of the subcontractor's obligations is substantially similar to that of a prime contractor's or general manager's obligations for a development project; or

(c) Entry into a contract or subcontract where the consideration includes a share of ownership in, or participation in the royalties, earnings, or profits of, the economic development of resources located in Burma.
