(a) Nongovernmental organizations are authorized to export or reexport services to North Korea that would otherwise be prohibited by this part in support of the following not-for-profit activities:

(1) Activities to support humanitarian projects to meet basic human needs in North Korea, including drought, flood, and disaster relief; the distribution of food, medicine, and clothing intended to be used to relieve human suffering; the provision of shelter; the provision of clean water, sanitation, and hygiene assistance; the provision of health-related services; assistance for individuals with disabilities; and environmental programs;

(2) Activities to support democracy building in North Korea, including rule of law, citizen participation, government accountability, universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, access to information, and civil society development projects;

(3) Activities to support non-commercial development projects directly benefiting the North Korean people, including preventing infectious disease and promoting maternal/child health, sustainable agriculture, and clean water assistance; and

(4) Activities to support environmental protection, including the preservation and protection of threatened or endangered species and the remediation of pollution or other environmental damage.

(b) Nongovernmental organizations are authorized to export or reexport to North Korea from a third country food, as defined in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, and medicine, as defined in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, in support of the activities authorized in paragraph (a) of this section, provided that the food and medicine are not subject to the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR parts 730 through 774) (EAR). For export or reexport by a U.S. person to North Korea from a third country of other items that are not subject to the EAR, a specific license from OFAC is required.

Note 1 to paragraph (b):

Pursuant to 15 CFR 746.4(a), a license from the Department of Commerce is required to export or reexport any item subject to the EAR to North Korea, except food and medicine designated as EAR99.

Note 2 to paragraphs (a) and (b):

The authorizations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not eliminate the need to comply with other applicable provisions of law, including any requirements of agencies other than the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Such requirements include the EAR administered by the Department of Commerce and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 130) administered by the Department of State.

(c) U.S. depository institutions, U.S.-registered brokers or dealers in securities, and U.S.-registered money transmitters are authorized to process transfers of funds on behalf of U.S. or third-country nongovernmental organizations, including transfers of funds to or from North Korea, in support of the activities authorized by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) Nongovernmental organizations are authorized to engage in transactions with the Government of North Korea that are necessary for the activities authorized by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, including payment of reasonable and customary taxes, fees, and import duties to, and purchase or receipt of permits, licenses, or public utility services from, the Government of North Korea.

Note 3 to paragraph (d):

This paragraph (d) only authorizes nongovernmental organizations to conduct limited transactions with the Government of North Korea that are necessary for the activities described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, such as payment of reasonable and customary taxes and other fees. Partnerships and partnership agreements between nongovernmental organizations and the Government of North Korea or other blocked persons that are necessary for nongovernmental organizations to provide authorized services are not permitted without a specific license from OFAC.

(e) Except as authorized in paragraph (d) of this section, this section does not authorize the exportation or reexportation of services to, charitable donations to or for the benefit of, or any other transactions involving the Government of North Korea, the Workers' Party of Korea, or any other person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 510.201(a). Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis for these purposes.
