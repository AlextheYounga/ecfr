Pursuant to § 510.214, persons owned or controlled by a U.S. financial institution are subject to certain prohibitions under this part; as a result, the entries of persons blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, or blocked pursuant to other parts of 31 CFR chapter V in connection with North Korea-related activities, will also include the descriptive prefix text “Transactions Prohibited For Persons Owned or Controlled By U.S. Financial Institutions:”, followed by information about the applicable sanctions authority.

The property and interests in property of persons who meet the definition of the term Government of North Korea, as defined in § 510.311, are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section regardless of whether the names of such persons are published in the Federal Register or incorporated into the SDN List.

Notice of such orders will be provided: by publication in the Federal Register; in writing to persons OFAC may assess to have an interest in the property; or by issuing an order or directive in writing to financial institutions or other transaction intermediaries, and requiring the recipient of the order or directive to promptly disclose it to affected persons with whom the recipient maintains direct commercial relationships.

This prohibition includes the transfer (including the transfer on the books of any issuer or agent thereof), disposition, transportation, importation, exportation, or withdrawal of, or the endorsement or guaranty of signatures on, any securities on or after the effective date.
