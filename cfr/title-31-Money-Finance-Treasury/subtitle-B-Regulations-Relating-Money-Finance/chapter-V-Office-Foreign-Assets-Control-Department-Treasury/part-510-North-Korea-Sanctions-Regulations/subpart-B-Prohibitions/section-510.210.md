The property and interests in property of persons who meet the definition of the term Government of North Korea, as defined in § 510.311, are blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section regardless of whether the names of such persons are published in the Federal Register or incorporated into the SDN List.

(c) *Imposition of sanctions on foreign financial institutions.* Upon determining that a foreign financial institution has engaged in sanctionable activity described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may:

(1) Prohibit the opening or maintaining by a U.S. financial institution of a correspondent account or a payable-through account in the United States for the foreign financial institution; or
