(a) *General license.* Transactions, including the travel-related transactions set forth in § 515.560(c), that are related to the humanitarian projects in or related to Cuba that are designed to directly benefit the Cuban people as set forth in paragraph (b) are authorized, provided that the traveler's schedule of activities does not include free time or recreation in excess of that consistent with a full-time schedule.

Note 1 to paragraph (a):

Each person relying on the general authorization in this paragraph must retain specific records related to the authorized travel transactions. See §§ 501.601 and 501.602 of this chapter for applicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements.

Note 2 to paragraph (a):

See § 515.590(b) for an authorization for the provision of grants, scholarships, or awards related to humanitarian projects in or related to Cuba that are designed to directly benefit the Cuban people as set forth in paragraph (b).

(b) *Authorized humanitarian projects.* The following projects are authorized by paragraph (a) of this section: Medical and health-related projects; construction projects intended to benefit legitimately independent civil society groups; disaster preparedness, relief, and response; historical preservation; environmental projects; projects involving formal or non-formal educational training, within Cuba or off-island, on the following topics: Entrepreneurship and business, civil education, journalism, advocacy and organizing, adult literacy, or vocational skills; community-based grassroots projects; projects suitable to the development of small-scale private enterprise; projects that are related to agricultural and rural development that promote independent activity; microfinancing projects, except for loans, extensions of credit, or other financing prohibited by § 515.208; and projects to meet basic human needs.

Example to § 515.575(b):A U.S. group of medical professionals that specializes in disease treatment wishes to support a community in Cuba by providing the latest techniques and literature in disease education and prevention directly to the Cuban people. Provided that the medical professionals in the group maintain a full-time schedule related to disease education and prevention, these activities qualify for the general license.
