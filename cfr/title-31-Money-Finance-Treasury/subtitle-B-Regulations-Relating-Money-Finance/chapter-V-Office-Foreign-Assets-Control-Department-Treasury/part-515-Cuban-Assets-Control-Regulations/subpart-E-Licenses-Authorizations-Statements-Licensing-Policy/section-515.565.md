(6) In addition to all other information required by § 501.601 of this chapter, entities sponsoring travel pursuant to the authorization in this paragraph (b) must retain records sufficient to demonstrate that each individual traveler has engaged in a full-time schedule of activities that satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section.

These records must be furnished to the Office of Foreign Assets Control on demand pursuant to § 501.602 of this chapter.

Example 1 to paragraph (b): An organization wishes to sponsor and organize educational exchanges not involving academic study pursuant to a degree program for individuals to learn side-by-side with Cuban individuals in areas such as environmental protection or the arts.

The organization's activities qualify for the general license.Example 2 to paragraph (b): An individual plans to travel to Cuba to participate in discussions with Cuban artists on community projects, exchanges with the founders of a youth arts program, and extended dialogue with local city planners and architects to learn about historical restoration projects in Old Havana. The individual traveler will have a full-time schedule of such educational exchange activities that result in meaningful interaction between the traveler and individuals in Cuba. The individual's activities do not qualify for the general license for people-to-people travel because the individual is not traveling under the auspices of an organization that is a person subject to U.S. jurisdiction and that sponsors such exchanges to promote people-to-people contact. The individual's travel may qualify for the general license in § 515.574 (Support for the Cuban People) provided the individual meets all of its requirements.Note 6 to paragraph (b):

An organization that sponsors and organizes trips to Cuba in which travelers engage in individually selected and/or self-directed activities would not qualify for the general license. Authorized trips are expected to be led by the organization and to have a full-time schedule of activities in which the travelers will participate.
