(2) *Financial institution.* For purposes of this section, the term “financial institution” includes a banking institution, domestic bank, United States depository institution, financial institution, or U.S. financial institution, as those terms are defined in the applicable part of this chapter.

(3) *Transaction.* The term transaction includes transactions related to wire transfers, trade finance, securities, checks, foreign exchange, and goods or services.

(b) *Required information to be reported.* Reports on rejected transactions shall include the following:

(1) The name and address of the person that rejected the transaction pursuant to this chapter (*i.e.,* the person filing the report on the rejected transaction, such as a financial institution), and the name and telephone number of a contact from whom additional information may be obtained;

(2) A description of the rejected transaction, including the type of transaction; any persons, including financial institutions, participating in the transaction and their respective locations (*e.g.,* customers, beneficiaries, originators, letter of credit applicants, and their banks; intermediary banks; correspondent banks; issuing banks; and advising or confirming banks); a description of the property that is the subject of the transaction; and any reference numbers, account numbers, dates, or other information necessary to identify the transaction;
