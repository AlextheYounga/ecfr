Note 1 to § 578.201.

The names of persons designated or identified as blocked pursuant to amended E.O. 13694, or any further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency declared therein, whose property and interests in property therefore are blocked pursuant to this section, are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) using the following identifiers: for amended E.O. 13694: “[CYBER2]”; and for any further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency declared in E.O. 13694: using the identifier formulation “[CYBER-E.O.[E.O. number pursuant to which the person's property and interests in property are blocked]].” Persons designated pursuant to Section 224(a)(1) of CAATSA will have the identifier “[CAATSA-RUSSIA]”. Certain transactions with persons blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section relating to the Russian Federation may result in the imposition of secondary sanctions, and therefore such blocked persons' entries on the SDN List will include the descriptive prefix text “Secondary sanctions risk:” followed by information about the applicable secondary sanctions authority. The SDN List is accessible through the following page on OFAC's website: *www.treas.gov/sdn.* Additional information pertaining to the SDN List can be found in appendix A to this chapter. *See* § 578.411 concerning entities that may not be listed on the SDN List but whose property and interests in property are nevertheless blocked pursuant to this section.

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 *et seq.*) in section 203 (50 U.S.C. 1702) authorizes the blocking of property and interests in property of a person during the pendency of an investigation. Except as described in note 3 to this section, the names of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pending investigation pursuant to this section are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into the SDN List using the following identifiers: for amended E.O. 13694: “[BPI-CYBER2]”; for CAATSA: “[BPI-CAATSA-RUSSIA]”; and for any further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency declared in E.O. 13694: “[BPI-CYBER-E.O.[E.O. number pursuant to which the person's property and interests in property are blocked pending investigation]].”

Note 3 to § 578.201:

In certain cases, OFAC may issue an order to: identify as blocked specific property or interests in property of a person designated or otherwise blocked pursuant to this section; block specific property or interests in property of a person pending investigation; or block or impose other prohibitions with respect to specific property or interests in property less than full blocking sanctions. Notice of such orders will be provided: by publication in the Federal Register; in writing to persons OFAC may assess to have an interest in the property; or by issuing an order or directive in writing to financial institutions or other transaction intermediaries, and requiring the recipient of the order or directive to promptly disclose it to affected persons with whom the recipient maintains direct commercial relationships. Inquiries regarding any such order should be directed to OFAC's Compliance Division at 202-622-2490 or *https://ofac.treasury.gov/contact-ofac.*
