Note 1 to § 578.201.

The names of persons designated or identified as blocked pursuant to amended E.O. 13694, or any further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency declared therein, whose property and interests in property therefore are blocked pursuant to this section, are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List) using the following identifiers: for amended E.O. 13694: “[CYBER2]”; and for any further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency declared in E.O. 13694: using the identifier formulation “[CYBER-E.O.[E.O. number pursuant to which the person's property and interests in property are blocked]].” Persons designated pursuant to Section 224(a)(1) of CAATSA will have the identifier “[CAATSA-RUSSIA]”. Certain transactions with persons blocked pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section relating to the Russian Federation may result in the imposition of secondary sanctions, and therefore such blocked persons' entries on the SDN List will include the descriptive prefix text “Secondary sanctions risk:” followed by information about the applicable secondary sanctions authority. The SDN List is accessible through the following page on OFAC's website: *www.treas.gov/sdn.* Additional information pertaining to the SDN List can be found in appendix A to this chapter. *See* § 578.411 concerning entities that may not be listed on the SDN List but whose property and interests in property are nevertheless blocked pursuant to this section.

The names of persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pending investigation pursuant to this section also are published in the Federal Register and incorporated into the SDN List using the following identifiers: for amended E.O. 13694: “[BPI-CYBER2]”; for CAATSA: “[BPI-CAATSA-RUSSIA]”; and for any further Executive orders issued pursuant to the national emergency declared in E.O. 13694: “[BPI-CYBER-E.O.[E.O. number pursuant to which the person's property and interests in property are blocked pending investigation]].”
