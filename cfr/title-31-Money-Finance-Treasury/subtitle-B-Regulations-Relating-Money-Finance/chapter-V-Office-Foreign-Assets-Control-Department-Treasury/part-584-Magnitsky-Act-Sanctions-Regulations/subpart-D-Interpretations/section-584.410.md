##### § 584.410 Entities owned by one or more persons whose property and interests in property are blocked. #####

Persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 584.201(a) have an interest in all property and interests in property in which such blocked persons directly or indirectly own, whether individually or in the aggregate, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 584.201(a), regardless of whether the name of the entity is incorporated into OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List).
