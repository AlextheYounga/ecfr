The Magnitsky Act also provides for an exception from the above prohibitions for persons included on a classified annex if the President determines that such an exception is vital for the national security interests of the United States, and for a waiver of the above prohibitions if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that such a waiver is in the national interests of the United States.

(d) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section apply except to the extent transactions are authorized by regulations, orders, directives, rulings, instructions, licenses, or otherwise, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date.
