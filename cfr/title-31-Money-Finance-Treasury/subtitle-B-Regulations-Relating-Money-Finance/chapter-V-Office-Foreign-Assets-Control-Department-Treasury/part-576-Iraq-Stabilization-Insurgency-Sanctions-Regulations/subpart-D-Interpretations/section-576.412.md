##### § 576.412 Entities owned by a person whose property and interests in property are blocked. #####

A person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 576.201(a) has an interest in all property and interests in property of an entity in which it owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. The property and interests in property of such an entity, therefore, are blocked, and such an entity is a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 576.201(a), regardless of whether the entity itself is listed in the Annex to Executive Order 13315, as amended, or designated pursuant to § 576.201(a)(2) or (3).
