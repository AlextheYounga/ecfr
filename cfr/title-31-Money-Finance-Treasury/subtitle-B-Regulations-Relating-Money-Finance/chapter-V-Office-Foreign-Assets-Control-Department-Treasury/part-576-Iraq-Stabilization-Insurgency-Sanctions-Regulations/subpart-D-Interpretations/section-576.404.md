##### § 576.404 Termination and acquisition of an interest in property. #####

(a) Whenever a transaction licensed or authorized by or pursuant to this part results in the transfer of property (including any property interest) away from a person, such property shall no longer be deemed to be property blocked pursuant to § 576.201, unless there exists in the property another interest that is blocked pursuant to § 576.201 or any other part of this chapter, the transfer of which has not been effected pursuant to license or other authorization.

(b) Unless otherwise specifically provided in a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part, if property (including any property interest) is transferred or attempted to be transferred to a person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to § 576.201(a), such property shall be deemed to be property in which that person has an interest and therefore blocked.

(c) Unless otherwise provided in a license or authorization issued pursuant to this part, Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products shall enjoy the protections of § 576.206 until title passes to the initial purchaser. For purposes of this part, an *initial purchaser* is a purchaser other than the Government of Iraq or persons acting for it or on its behalf in the marketing or sale of Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products.
