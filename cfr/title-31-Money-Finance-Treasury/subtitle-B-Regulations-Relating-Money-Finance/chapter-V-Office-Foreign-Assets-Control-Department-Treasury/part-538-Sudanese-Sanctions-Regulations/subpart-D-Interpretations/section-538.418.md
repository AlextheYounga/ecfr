##### ยง 538.418 Financial transactions in Sudan. #####

(a) Any financial transaction with a depository institution located in an area of Sudan other than the Specified Areas of Sudan, e.g., Khartoum, remains prohibited.

(b) Financial transactions are no longer prohibited by this part if:

(1) The underlying activity is not prohibited by this part;

(2) The financial transaction involves a third-country depository institution, or a Sudanese depository institution not owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan, that is located in the Specified Areas of Sudan; and

(3) The financial transaction is not routed through a depository institution that is located in an area of Sudan other than the Specified Areas of Sudan or that is owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan, wherever located.

(c) *Example.* A U.S. bank is instructed to transfer funds to the Abyei branch of a Sudanese bank that is not owned or controlled by the Government of Sudan. In order for the transfer to take place, the U.S. bank is required to route the funds through the Sudanese bank's headquarters, which is located in Khartoum. Due to the routing of the financial transaction through Khartoum, this transaction is prohibited and requires authorization from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. However, if the U.S. bank is able to bypass the Khartoum headquarters and transfer the funds directly to the Abyei branch of the Sudanese bank, then the transaction would not be prohibited.
