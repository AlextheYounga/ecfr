##### § 538.526 Brokering commercial sales of agricultural commodities, medicine, and medical devices. #####

(a) *General license for brokering sales by U.S. persons.* United States persons are authorized to provide brokerage services on behalf of U.S. persons for the sales and exportations or reexportations by United States persons that are described in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of § 538.523, provided that the sale and exportation or reexportation is authorized, as applicable, by a one-year specific license issued pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of § 538.523 or by one of the general licenses set forth in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of § 538.523.

(b) *Specific licensing for brokering sales by non-U.S. persons of bulk agricultural commodities.* Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case basis to permit United States persons to provide brokerage services on behalf of non-United States, non-Sudanese persons for the sale and exportation or reexportation of bulk agricultural commodities to the Government of Sudan, to any individual or entity in an area of Sudan other than the Specified Areas of Sudan, or to persons in third countries purchasing specifically for resale to the foregoing. Specific licenses issued pursuant to this section will authorize the brokering only of sales that:

(1) Are limited to the bulk agricultural commodities listed in appendix A to this part 538;

(2) Are to purchasers permitted pursuant to § 538.523(a)(1); and

Note to paragraph (b)(2) of § 538.526:

Requests for specific licenses to provide brokerage services under this paragraph must include all of the information described in § 538.523(c).

(3) Make any performance involving the exportation or reexportation of any goods, technology or services (including technical data, software, or information) that are subject to license application requirements of another Federal agency contingent upon the prior authorization of that agency. (For example, items classified EAR 99 under the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR parts 730 through 774, may in certain instances require a license from the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security. See, e.g., 15 CFR 736.2(b)(5), 744.2 through 744.4, 744.7, and 744.10; see also 22 CFR 123.9.)

(c) *No debit to blocked accounts.* Payment for any brokerage fee earned pursuant to this section may not involve a debit to an account blocked pursuant to this part.

(d) *Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.* Attention is drawn to the recordkeeping, retention, and reporting requirements of §§ 501.601 and 501.602.
