##### ยง 223.3 Issuance of certificates of authority. #####

(a)(1)(i) A company submitting an application to be issued a certificate of authority by Treasury to underwrite and reinsure Federal surety bonds must include all required data and information, as determined by Treasury in its discretion, for the application to be complete and ready for review. Upon receipt of a complete application, Treasury will evaluate the submission to determine whether the applicant company:

(A) Is duly authorized under its charter or articles of incorporation to conduct the business referenced under 31 U.S.C. 9304(a)(2);

(B) Has paid-up capital of at least $250,000 in cash or its equivalent;

(C) Is solvent and financially and otherwise qualified to conduct the business referenced under 31 U.S.C. 9304(a)(2); and

(D) Is able and willing to carry out its contracts.

(ii) In making the determination whether a company meets these requirements, Treasury will evaluate the application as a whole, the required financial statement(s) submitted by the company, the company's charter or articles of incorporation, the past history of the company, and any further evidence or information that Treasury may require the company to submit (at the company's expense).

(2) If Treasury determines, in its discretion, that the applicant company meets all of these requirements, Treasury will issue a certificate of authority to the company authorizing it to underwrite and reinsure Federal bonds. The certificate of authority will be effective for a term that expires on the last day of the next June. All such statutory requirements and regulatory requirements under this part are continuing obligations, and any certificate is issued expressly subject to continuing compliance with such requirements. The certificate of authority will be renewed annually on the first day of July, *provided* the company remains qualified under the law, the regulations in this part, and other pertinent Treasury requirements, *and* the company submits the fee required under ยง 223.22 by March 1st of each year to the address and/or account specified by Treasury.

(b) If a company meets the requirements for a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds in all respects except that it is a United States branch of a company not incorporated under the laws of the United States or of any State, or it is limited by its articles of incorporation or corporate charter to reinsure business only, it may be issued a certificate of authority as a reinsuring company on Federal bonds. The fees for initial application and renewal of a certificate as a reinsuring company shall be the same as the fees for a certificate of authority as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds.
