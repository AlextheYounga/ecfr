##### ยง 358.15 What happens if securities are adjusted? #####

(a) If we make an adjustment to all or part of the submitted securities, we will instruct the depository institution to transfer BECCS or CUBES securities of the same payment date and face amount from the depository institution's account to an account that we designate.

(b) If no such BECCS or CUBES securities exist in the depository institution's account, we will instruct the depository institution as to how the adjustment will be made.

(c) If the depository institution fails to comply with our instructions within five (5) business days of receipt of the instructions, we reserve the right to debit the master account of the depository institution for the face value of the adjusted bearer corpora and detached bearer coupons. By the submission of the bearer corpora and detached bearer coupons, the depository institution is deemed to agree to this debit.
