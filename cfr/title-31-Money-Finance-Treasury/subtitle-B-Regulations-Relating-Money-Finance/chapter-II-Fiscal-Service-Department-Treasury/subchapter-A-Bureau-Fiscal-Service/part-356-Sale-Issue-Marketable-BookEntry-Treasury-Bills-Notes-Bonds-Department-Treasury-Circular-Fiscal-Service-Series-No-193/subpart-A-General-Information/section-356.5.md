##### § 356.5 What types of securities does the Treasury auction? #####

We offer securities under this part exclusively in book-entry form and as direct obligations of the United States issued under Chapter 31 of Title 31 of the United States Code. The securities are subject to the terms and conditions in this part, the regulations in 31 CFR part 363 (for securities held in TreasuryDirect), the regulations in 31 CFR part 357 (for securities held in the commercial book-entry system and Legacy Treasury Direct), and the auction announcements. When we issue additional securities with the same CUSIP number as outstanding securities, we consider them to be the same securities as the outstanding securities.

(a) *Treasury bills.* (1) Are issued at a discount or at par, depending upon the auction results;

(2) Are redeemed at their par amount at maturity; and

(3) Have maturities of not more than one year.

1 We use the term “non-indexed” in this part to distinguish such notes and bonds from “inflation-protected securities” and “floating rate notes.” We refer to non-indexed notes and non-indexed bonds as “notes” and “bonds” in official Treasury publications, such as auction announcements and auction results press releases, as well as in auction systems.
