##### § 356.25 How does the settlement process work? #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 40440, July 7, 2022.

Securities bought in the auction must be paid for by the issue date. The payment amount for awarded securities will be the settlement amount as defined in § 356.2. (See formulas in appendix B.) There are several ways to pay for securities:

(a) *Payment by debit entry to a deposit account.* If you are paying by debit entry to a deposit account as provided for in § 356.17 (b) and (c), we will charge the settlement amount to the specified account on the issue date.

(b) *Payment by authorized charge to a funds account.* Where the submitter's method of payment is an authorized charge to the funds account of a depository institution as provided for in § 356.17 (d), we will charge the settlement amount to the specified funds account on the issue date.

(c) *Payment through a certificate of indebtedness.* If you are paying with the redemption proceeds of your certificate of indebtedness as provided for in § 356.17(b), we will redeem the certificate of indebtedness for the settlement amount of the security and apply the proceeds on the issue date.

(d) *Payment with bids.* If you paid the par amount with your bids as provided for in § 356.17 (c)(2), you may have to pay an additional amount, or we may have to pay an amount to you, as follows:

(1) *When we owe an amount to you.* If the amount you paid is more than the settlement amount, we will refund the balance to you after the auction. This will generally occur if you submit payment with your bids. A typical example would be an auction where the price is a discount from par and there is no accrued interest.

(2) *When you must remit an additional amount.* If the settlement amount is more than the amount you paid, we will notify you of the additional amount due. You may owe us such an additional amount if the auction calculations result in a premium or if accrued interest or an inflation adjustment is due. If your securities are to be held in TreasuryDirect ®, we will collect this amount through the same payment method that you previously authorized for the transaction. If your securities are to be held in Legacy Treasury Direct ®, you will be responsible for remitting this additional amount immediately.
