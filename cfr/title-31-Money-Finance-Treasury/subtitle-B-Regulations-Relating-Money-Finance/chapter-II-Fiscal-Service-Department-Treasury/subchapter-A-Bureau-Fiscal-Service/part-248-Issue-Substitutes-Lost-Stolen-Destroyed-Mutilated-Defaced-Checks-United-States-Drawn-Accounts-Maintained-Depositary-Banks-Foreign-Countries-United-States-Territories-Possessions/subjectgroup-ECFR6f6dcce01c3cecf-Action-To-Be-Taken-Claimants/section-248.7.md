##### ยง 248.7 Claims requiring settlement action. #####

There are certain types of claims on which the disbursing officer will not be authorized to take final action. These include:

(a) Claims on original checks which have been outstanding more than one full fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the checks were issued, and

(b) Claims involving doubtful questions of law and fact.

In such cases the disbursing officer will obtain information and supporting papers, including an undertaking of indemnity, from the claimant and transmit such data to the Claims Division, General Accounting Office, for settlement action.
