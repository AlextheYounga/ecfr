*Current Treasury borrowing rate* means the prevailing market rate, as determined by Treasury, for a Treasury security with the specified period to maturity.

At any time that the Secretary establishes such proxies or a rate-setting method or determines that the methodology should be revised, we will make an announcement.

(1) Any amounts that constitute gross proceeds of a tax-exempt bond issue or are reasonably expected to become gross proceeds of a tax-exempt bond issue;

(2) Any amounts that formerly were gross proceeds of a tax-exempt bond issue, but no longer are treated as gross proceeds of such issue as a result of the operation of the universal cap on the maximum amount treated as gross proceeds under 26 CFR 1.148-6(b)(2);

*“We,” “us,” or “the Secretary”* refers to the Secretary and the Secretary's delegates at the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Bureau of the Fiscal Service (Fiscal Service).
