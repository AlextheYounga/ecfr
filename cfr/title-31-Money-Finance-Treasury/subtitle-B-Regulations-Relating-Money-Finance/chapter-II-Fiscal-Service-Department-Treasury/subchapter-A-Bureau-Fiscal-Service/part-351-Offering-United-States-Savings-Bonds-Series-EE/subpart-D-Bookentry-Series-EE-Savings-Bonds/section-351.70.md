##### § 351.70 How are redemption values calculated for book-entry Series EE savings bonds? #####

We base current redemption values (CRV) for book-entry Series EE savings bonds on the definitive savings bond CRV. We use the CRV for a $100 principal amount as calculated in § 351.16 to calculate a CRV prorated to the book-entry principal investment amount for the corresponding issue and redemption dates. Calculated book-entry CRV will be rounded to the nearest one cent. 2 The formula is as follows:

2 Example: Calculated value of $25.044 rounds to $25.04; calculated value of $25.045 rounds to $25.05.

[Book-entry principal investment ÷ $100] × [CRV value for $100 principal amount].[68 FR 24796, May 8, 2003, as amended at 75 FR 52460, Aug. 26, 2010]
