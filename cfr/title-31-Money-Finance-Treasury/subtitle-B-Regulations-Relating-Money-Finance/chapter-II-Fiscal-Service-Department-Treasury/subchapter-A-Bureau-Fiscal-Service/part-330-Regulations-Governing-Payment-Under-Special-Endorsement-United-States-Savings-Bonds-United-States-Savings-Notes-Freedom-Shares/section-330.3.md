##### ยง 330.3 Special endorsement of securities. #####

(a) *Form of endorsement.* Each security processed under the provisions of this part shall bear the following endorsement:

Request by owner and validity of transaction guaranteed in accordance with Treasury Department Circular No. 888, as revised. (Name, location and paying agent code number assigned by a TRS Site.) (Name, location, and paying agent code number assigned by designated Federal Reserve Bank.)

This endorsement must be legibly impressed in black or other dark-colored ink on the back of the security in the space provided for the owner to request payment.

(b) *Endorsement stamps.* Endorsement stamps may be obtained from a TRS Site or, with its approval, purchased by the agent. Requests for stamps to be furnished or approved by a TRS Site must be made in writing by an officer of the paying agent. Stamps procured by an agent may not exceed a space bounded by 13/4 inches vertically and 3 inches horizontally. They must follow exactly the wording prescribed. They may also include space for the transaction date and the initials or signature of the officer or employee authorized to approve the transaction.

(c) *Securities registered in coownership or beneficiary form.* In the case of securities registered in coownership or beneficiary form, the agent shall indicate which person, whose name is inscribed thereon, requested payment or exchange by encircling in black or other dark-colored ink the name of that person (or both coowners, if the request is joint) in the inscription on the face of the securities.

(d) *Restrictions.* Under no circumstances shall the special endorsement procedure be used to give effect to a transfer, hypothecation or pledge of a security, or to permit payment to any person other than the owner, coowner, or, where appropriate, beneficiary. Violation of these provisions will be cause for withdrawal of an agent's authority to process securities under the special endorsement procedure, and may involve additional penalties if the circumstances warrant such action.
