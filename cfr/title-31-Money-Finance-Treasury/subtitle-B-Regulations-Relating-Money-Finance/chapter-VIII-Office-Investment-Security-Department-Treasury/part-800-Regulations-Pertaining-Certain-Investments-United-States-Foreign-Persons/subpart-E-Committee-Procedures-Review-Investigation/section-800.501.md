(a) In any review or investigation of a covered transaction, the Committee should consider the factors specified in section 721(f) and, as appropriate, require parties to provide to the Committee the information necessary to consider such factors. The Committee's review or investigation (if necessary) shall examine, as appropriate, whether:

(1) The transaction is by or with any foreign person and could result in foreign control of a U.S. business;

(2) There is credible evidence to support a belief that any foreign person exercising control of that U.S. business might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States; and

(3) Provisions of law, other than section 721 and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, provide adequate and appropriate authority to protect the national security of the United States.

(b) During the review period or during an investigation, the Staff Chairperson may invite the parties to a notified transaction to attend a meeting with the Committee staff to discuss and clarify issues pertaining to the transaction. During an investigation, a party to the transaction under investigation may request a meeting with the Committee staff; such a request ordinarily will be granted.

(c) The Staff Chairperson shall be the point of contact for receiving material filed with the Committee, including notices.

(d) Where more than one lead agency is designated, communications on material matters between a party to the transaction and a lead agency shall include all lead agencies designated with regard to those matters.
