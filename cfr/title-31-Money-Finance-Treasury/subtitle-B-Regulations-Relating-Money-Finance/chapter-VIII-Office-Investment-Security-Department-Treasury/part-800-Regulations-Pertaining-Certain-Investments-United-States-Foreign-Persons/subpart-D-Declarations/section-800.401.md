(j) Examples:

(1) *Example 1.* Corporation A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor and in which no foreign government has a substantial interest, proposes to acquire a four percent, non-controlling equity interest in Corporation B, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business that manufactures a critical technology. Under the terms of the investment, a designee of Corporation A will have the right to observe the meetings of the board of directors of Corporation B. Corporation B manufactures the critical technology for commercial off-the-shelf use by businesses in various industries, including some identified in appendix B to this part. Assuming no other relevant facts, the proposed transaction is a covered investment, but is not subject to a mandatory declaration or notice under § 800.401 because Corporation B does not produce, design, test, manufacture, fabricate, or develop the critical technology specifically for use in one or more industries identified in appendix B to this part.

(2) *Example 2.* Investment Fund A, a foreign person that is not an excepted investor, acquires a 10 percent equity interest in Corporation A, an unaffiliated TID U.S. business, and the right to appoint one member of Corporation A's board of directors. Corporation A is manufacturing critical technologies utilized in Corporation A's activity in one or more industries identified in appendix B to this part. Investment Fund A satisfies the requirements under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Investment Fund A's investment in Corporation A is a covered investment, but the transaction is not subject to the mandatory declaration requirement.

(3) *Example 3.* Same facts as the example in paragraph (j)(2) of this section, except that in connection with Investment Fund A's transaction, Limited Partner X, a limited partner of Investment Fund A and a foreign national that is not an excepted investor, receives access to the material non-public technical information of Corporation A. Limited Partner X's indirect investment in Corporation A is a covered investment. While Investment Fund A's direct investment is not subject to a mandatory declaration, Limited Partner X's indirect investment in Corporation A is subject to a mandatory declaration.
