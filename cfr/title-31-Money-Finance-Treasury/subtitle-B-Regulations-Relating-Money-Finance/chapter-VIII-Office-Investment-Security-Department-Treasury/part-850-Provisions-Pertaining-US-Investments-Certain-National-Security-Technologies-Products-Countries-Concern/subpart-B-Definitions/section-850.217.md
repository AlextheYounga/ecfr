(2) Intended by the covered foreign person or joint venture to be used for any of the following:

(i) Cybersecurity applications;

(ii) Digital forensics tools;

(iii) Penetration testing tools; or

(iv) The control of robotic systems; or

(3) Trained using a quantity of computing power greater than 10^23 computational operations (*e.g.,* integer or floating-point operations).

Note 1 to § 850.217:

Consistent with section 3 of the Order, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, and, as appropriate, the heads of other relevant agencies, shall periodically assess whether the criterion described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section is serving to effectively address threats to the national security of the United States described in the Order and make updates, as appropriate, through public notice.

Note 3 to § 850.217:

For purposes of paragraph (d) of this section, a person customizing, configuring, or fine-tuning a third-party AI model or machine-based system strictly for its own internal, non-commercial use (*e.g.,* not for sale or licensing) would not implicate the notification requirements for related transactions solely on that basis unless the person's internal, non-commercial use is for government intelligence, mass-surveillance, or military end use, or for digital forensics tools, penetration testing tools, or the control of robotic systems.
