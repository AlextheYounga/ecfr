See ยง 800.304 regarding factors the Committee will consider in determining whether to include the rights to be acquired by a foreign person upon the conversion of convertible voting instruments as part of the Committee's assessment of whether a transaction that involves such instruments is a covered transaction.

Example.Corporation A, a foreign person, signs a concession agreement to operate the toll road business of Corporation B, a U.S. business, for 99 years. Corporation B, however, is required under the agreement to perform safety and security functions with respect to the business and to monitor compliance by Corporation A with the operating requirements of the agreement on an ongoing basis. Corporation B may terminate the agreement or impose other penalties for breach of these operating requirements. Assuming no other relevant facts, this is not a transaction.
