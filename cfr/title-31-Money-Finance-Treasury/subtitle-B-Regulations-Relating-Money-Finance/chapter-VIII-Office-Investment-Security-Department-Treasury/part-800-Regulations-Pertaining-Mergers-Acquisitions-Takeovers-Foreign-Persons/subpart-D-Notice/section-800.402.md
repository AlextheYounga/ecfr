See Department of Defense, “Industrial Security Regulation,” DOD 5220.22-R, and “Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information,” DOD 5220.22-M.

If a U.S. business does not prepare an annual report and its financial results are not included within the consolidated financial results stated in the annual report of a parent, the filing shall include, if available, the entity's most recent audited financial statement (or, if an audited financial statement is not available, the unaudited financial statement).
