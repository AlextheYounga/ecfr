##### § 55.25 Areawide compliance. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 30913, Apr. 23, 2024.

(a) A HUD-approved areawide compliance process may be substituted for individual compliance or aggregated compliance under § 55.24 where a series of individual actions is proposed or contemplated in a pertinent area for HUD's examination of floodplain hazards. In areawide compliances, the area for examination may include a sector of, or the entire, floodplain—as relevant to the proposed or anticipated actions. The areawide compliance process shall be in accord with the decision making process under § 55.20.

(b) The areawide compliance process shall address the relevant executive orders and shall consider local land use planning and development controls (e.g., those enforced by the community for purposes of floodplain management under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)) and applicable state programs for floodplain management. The process shall include the development and publication of a strategy that identifies the range of development and mitigation measures under which the proposed HUD assistance may be approved and that indicates the types of actions that will not be approved in the floodplain.

(c) Individual actions that fit within the types of proposed HUD actions specifically addressed under the areawide compliance do not require further compliance with § 55.20 except that a determination by the Department or a responsible entitysubject to 24 CFR part 58 shall be made concerning whether the individual action accords with the areawide strategy. Where the individual action does not accord with the areawide strategy, specific development and mitigation measures shall be prescribed as a condition of HUD's approval of the individual action.

(d) Areawide compliance under the procedures of this section is subject to the following provisions:

(1) It shall be initiated by HUD through a formal agreement of understanding with affected local governments concerning mutual responsibilities governing the preparation, issuance, implementation, and enforcement of the areawide strategy;

(2) It may be performed jointly with one or more Federal departments or agencies, or responsible entities subject to 24 CFR part 58 that serve as the responsible Federal official;

(3) It shall establish mechanisms to ensure that:

(i) The terms of approval of individual actions (e.g., concerning structures and facilities) will be consistent with the areawide strategy;

(ii) The controls set forth in the areawide strategy are implemented and enforced in a timely manner; and

(iii) Where necessary, mitigation for individual actions will be established as a condition of approval.

(4) An open scoping process (in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7) shall be used for determining the scope of issues to be addressed and for identifying significant issues related to housing and community development for the floodplain;

(5) Federal, state and local agencies with expertise in floodplain management, flood evacuation preparedness, land use planning and building regulation, or soil and natural resource conservation shall be invited to participate in the scoping process and to provide advice and comments; and

(6) Eligibility for participation in and the use of the areawide compliance must be limited to communities that are in the Regular Program of the National Flood Insurance Program and in good standing (*i.e.,* not suspended from program eligibility or placed on probation under 44 CFR 59.24), thereby demonstrating a capacity for and commitment to floodplain management standards sufficient to perform responsibilities under this part.

(7) An expiration date (not to exceed ten years from the date of the formal adoption by the local governments) for HUD approval of areawide compliance under this part must be stated in the agreement between the local governments and HUD. In conjunction with the setting of an expiration date, a mechanism for HUD's reevaluation of the appropriateness of areawide compliance must be provided in the agreement.
