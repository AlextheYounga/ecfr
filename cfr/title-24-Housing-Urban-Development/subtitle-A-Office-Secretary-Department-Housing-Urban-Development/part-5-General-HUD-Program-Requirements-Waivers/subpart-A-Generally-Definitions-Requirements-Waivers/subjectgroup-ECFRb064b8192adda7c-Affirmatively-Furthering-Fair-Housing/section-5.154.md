##### § 5.154 Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH). #####

(a) *General.* To develop a successful affirmatively furthering fair housing strategy, it is central to assess the elements and factors that cause, increase, contribute to, maintain, or perpetuate segregation, racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, significant disparities in access to opportunity, and disproportionate housing needs. For HUD program participants already required to develop plans for effective uses of HUD funds consistent with the statutory requirements and goals governing such funds, an AFH will be integrated into such plans.

(b) *Requirement to submit an AFH.* In furtherance of the statutory obligation to affirmatively further fair housing, an AFH must be developed following the AFH consultation, content, and submission requirements described in §§ 5.150 through 5.180, and submitted in a manner and form prescribed by HUD by the following entities:

(1) Jurisdictions and Insular Areas that are required to submit consolidated plans for the following programs:

(i) The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program (see 24 CFR part 570, subparts D and I);

(ii) The Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG) program (see 24 CFR part 576);

(iii) The HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program (see 24 CFR part 92); and

(iv) The Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS (HOPWA) program (see 24 CFR part 574).

(2) Public housing agencies (PHAs) receiving assistance under sections 8 or 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f or 42 U.S.C.1437g).

(c) *Fair housing data.* Program participants will use HUD-provided data, as defined within the definition of “data” in § 5.152, and supplement the HUD-provided data, as needed, with local data and local knowledge, as guided by the Assessment Tool.

(d) *Content.* Using the Assessment Tool prescribed by HUD, each program participant shall conduct an AFH for the purpose of examining its programs, jurisdiction, and region, and identifying goals to affirmatively further fair housing and to inform fair housing strategies in the consolidated plan, annual action plan, the PHA Plan and any other plan incorporated therein, and community plans including, but not limited to, education, transportation, or environmental related plans. The AFH's analysis, goals, and priorities will address integration and segregation; racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty; disparities in access to opportunity; and disproportionate housing needs based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, and disability. The AFH will assess the jurisdiction's fair housing enforcement and fair housing outreach capacity. At a minimum, the AFH will include the following elements:

(1) *Summary of fair housing issues and capacity.* The AFH must include a summary of fair housing issues in the jurisdiction, including any findings, lawsuits, enforcement actions, settlements, or judgments related to fair housing or other civil rights laws, an assessment of compliance with existing fair housing laws and regulations, and an assessment of the jurisdiction's fair housing enforcement and fair housing outreach capacity.

(2) *Analysis of data.* Using HUD-provided data, local data, local knowledge, including information gained through community participation, and the Assessment Tool, the program participant will undertake the analysis required by this section. This analysis will address the following to the extent the data or local knowledge are informative of the following:

(i) Identification of integration and segregation patterns and trends based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, and disability within the jurisdiction and region;

(ii) Identification of racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty within the jurisdiction and region;

(iii) Identification of significant disparities in access to opportunity for any protected class within the jurisdiction and region; and

(iv) Identification of disproportionate housing needs for any protected class within the jurisdiction and region.

(3) *Assessment of fair housing issues.* Using the Assessment Tool provided by HUD, the AFH will identify the contributing factors for segregation, racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disparities in access to opportunity, and disproportionate housing needs as identified under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(4) *Identification of fair housing priorities and goals.* Consistent with the identification of fair housing issues, and the analysis and assessment conducted under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section, the AFH must:

(i) Identify and discuss the fair housing issues arising from the assessment; and

(ii) Identify significant contributing factors, prioritize such factors, and justify the prioritization of the contributing factors that will be addressed in the program participant's fair housing goals. In prioritizing contributing factors, program participants shall give highest priority to those factors that limit or deny fair housing choice or access to opportunity, or negatively impact fair housing or civil rights compliance; and

(iii) Set goals for overcoming the effects of contributing factors as prioritized in accordance with paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section. For each goal, a program participant must identify one or more contributing factors that the goal is designed to address, describe how the goal relates to overcoming the identified contributing factor(s) and related fair housing issue(s), and identify the metrics and milestones for determining what fair housing results will be achieved. For instance, where segregation in a development or geographic area is determined to be a fair housing issue, with at least one significant contributing factor, HUD would expect the AFH to include one or more goals to reduce the segregation.

(5) *Strategies and actions.* To implement goals and priorities in an AFH, strategies and actions shall be included in program participants' consolidated plans, Annual Action Plans, and PHA Plans (including any plans incorporated therein), and need not be reflected in their AFH. Strategies and actions must affirmatively further fair housing and may include, but are not limited to, enhancing mobility strategies and encouraging development of new affordable housing in areas of opportunity, as well as place-based strategies to encourage community revitalization, including preservation of existing affordable housing, including HUD-assisted housing.

(6) *Summary of community participation.* The AFH must include a concise summary of the community participation process, public comments, and efforts made to broaden community participation in the development of the AFH; a summary of the comments, views, and recommendations, received in writing, or orally at public hearings, during the community participation process; and a summary of any comments, views, and recommendations not accepted by the program participant and the reasons for nonacceptance.

(7) *Review of progress achieved since submission of prior AFH.* For each AFH submitted after the first AFH submission, the program participant will provide a summary of progress achieved in meeting the goals and associated metrics and milestones of the prior AFH, and identify any barriers that impeded or prevented achievement of goals.
