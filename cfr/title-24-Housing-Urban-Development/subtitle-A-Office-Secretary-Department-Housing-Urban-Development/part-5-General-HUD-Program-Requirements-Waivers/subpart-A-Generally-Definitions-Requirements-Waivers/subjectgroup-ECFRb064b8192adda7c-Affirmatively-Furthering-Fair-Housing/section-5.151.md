##### § 5.151 AFFH certifications. #####

A HUD program participant's certification that it will affirmatively further fair housing is sufficient if the participant takes, in the relevant period, any action that is rationally related to promoting one or more attributes of fair housing as defined in section 5.150(a). Nothing in this paragraph relieves jurisdictions of their other obligations under civil rights and fair housing statutes and regulations.
