Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 30790, June 10, 2021.

A HUD program participant's certification that it will affirmatively further fair housing is sufficient if the participant takes, in the relevant period, any action that is rationally related to promoting one or more attributes of fair housing as defined in section 5.150(a). Nothing in this paragraph relieves jurisdictions of their other obligations under civil rights and fair housing statutes and regulations.
