##### ยง 5.158 Community participation, consultation, and coordination. #####

(a) *General.* To ensure that the AFH is informed by meaningful community participation, program participants must give the public reasonable opportunities for involvement in the development of the AFH and in the incorporation of the AFH into the consolidated plan, PHA Plan, and other required planning documents. To ensure that the AFH, the consolidated plan, and the PHA Plan and any plan incorporated therein are informed by meaningful community participation, program participants should employ communications means designed to reach the broadest audience. Such communications may be met, as appropriate, by publishing a summary of each document in one or more newspapers of general circulation, and by making copies of each document available on the Internet, on the program participant's official government Web site, and as well at libraries, government offices, and public places. Program participants shall ensure that all aspects of community participation are conducted in accordance with fair housing and civil rights laws, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the regulations at 24 CFR part 1; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the regulations at 24 CFR part 8; and the Americans with Disabilities Act and the regulations at 28 CFR parts 35 and 36, as applicable. At a minimum, whether a program participant is preparing an AFH individually or in combination with other program participants, AFH community participation must include the following for consolidated plan program participants and PHAs (as applicable):

(1) *Consolidated plan program participants.* The consolidated plan program participant must follow the policies and procedures described in its applicable citizen participation plan, adopted pursuant to 24 CFR part 91 (see 24 CFR 91.105, 91.115, and 91.401), in the process of developing the AFH, obtaining community feedback, and addressing complaints. The jurisdiction must consult with the agencies and organizations identified in consultation requirements at 24 CFR part 91 (see 24 CFR 91.100, 91.110, and 91.235).

(2) *PHAs.* PHAs must follow the policies and procedures described in 24 CFR 903.13, 903.15, 903.17, and 903.19 in the process of developing the AFH, obtaining Resident Advisory Board and community feedback, and addressing complaints.

(b) *Coordination.* (1) As described in 903.15, a PHA may fulfill its responsibility to conduct an AFH by:

(i) Participating with a consolidated plan program participant, including State jurisdictions; or

(ii) Participating with one or more PHAs in the planning, and preparation of the AFH; or

(iii) Preparing its own AFH.

(2) When working with other program participants, PHAs are encouraged to enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) to clearly define the functions, level of member participation, method of dispute resolution, and decisionmaking process of the program participants, in the creation of the AFH.
