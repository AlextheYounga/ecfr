##### § 5.162 Review of AFH. #####

(a) *Review and acceptance of AFH* - (1) *General.* HUD's review of an AFH is to determine whether the program participant has met the requirements for providing its analysis, assessment, and goal setting, as set forth in § 5.154(d). The AFH will be deemed accepted after 60 calendar days after the date that HUD receives the AFH, unless on or before that date, HUD has provided notification that HUD does not accept the AFH. In its notification, HUD will inform the program participant in writing of the reasons why HUD has not accepted the AFH and the actions that the program participant may take to resolve the nonacceptance.

(2) *Meaning of “acceptance”.* HUD's acceptance of an AFH means only that, for purposes of administering HUD program funding, HUD has determined that the program participant has provided an AFH that meets the required elements, as set forth in § 5.154(d). Acceptance does not mean that the program participant has complied with its obligation to affirmatively further fair housing under the Fair Housing Act; has complied with other provisions of the Fair Housing Act; or has complied with other civil rights laws and regulations.

(b) *Nonacceptance of an AFH.* (1) HUD will not accept an AFH if HUD finds that the AFH or a portion of the AFH is inconsistent with fair housing or civil rights requirements or is substantially incomplete. In connection with a regional or joint AFH, HUD's determination to not accept the AFH with respect to one program participant does not necessarily affect the acceptance of the AFH with respect to another program participant.

(i) The following are examples of an AFH that is inconsistent with fair housing and civil rights requirements:

(A) HUD determines that the analysis of fair housing issues, fair housing contributing factors, goals, or priorities contained in the AFH would result in policies or practices that would operate to discriminate in violation of the Fair Housing Act or other civil rights laws;

(B) The AFH does not identify policies or practices as fair housing contributing factors, even though they result in the exclusion of a protected class from areas of opportunity.

(ii) The following are examples of an AFH that is substantially incomplete:

(A) The AFH was developed without the required community participation or the required consultation;

(B) The AFH fails to satisfy a required element in §§ 5.150 through 5.180. Failure to satisfy a required element includes an assessment in which priorities or goals are materially inconsistent with the data or other evidence available to the program participant or in which priorities or goals are not designed to overcome the effects of contributing factors and related fair housing issues.

(2) HUD will provide written notification to the program participant, including each program participant involved in a collaborative AFH (joint or regional AFH), of HUD's nonacceptance of the AFH and the written notification will specify the reasons why the AFH was not accepted and will provide guidance on how the AFH should be revised in order to be accepted.

(c) *Revisions and resubmission.* HUD will provide a program participant, including each program participant involved in a collaborative AFH, with a time period to revise and resubmit the AFH, which shall be no less than 45 calendar days after the date on which HUD provides written notification that it does not accept the AFH. The revised AFH will be deemed accepted after 30 calendar days of the date by which HUD receives the revised AFH, unless on or before that date HUD has provided notification that HUD does not accept the revised AFH.

(d) *Accepted AFH as requirement for consolidated plan and PHA Plan approval.* If a program participant does not have an accepted AFH, HUD will disapprove a consolidated plan (see 24 CFR 91.500) or a PHA Plan (see 24 CFR 903.23) except where delayed submission is otherwise permitted under § 5.156 or § 5.160.

(1) If a consolidated plan program participant fails to submit an AFH as required by § 5.160, HUD may establish an alternative date for the jurisdiction to submit its consolidated plan, but in no event past the August 16 deadline provided in 24 CFR 91.15. Failure to submit a consolidated plan by August 16 of the Federal fiscal year for which funds are appropriated will automatically result in the loss of the CDBG funds to which the jurisdiction would otherwise be entitled.

(2) If a PHA fails to submit the AFH in accordance with § 5.160, the PHA must have an accepted AFH no later than 75 calendar days before the commencement of the PHA's fiscal year to avoid any potential impacts on funding.
