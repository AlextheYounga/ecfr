##### § 5.152 Definitions. #####

For purposes of §§ 5.150 through 5.180, the terms “consolidated plan,” “consortium,” “unit of general local government,” “jurisdiction,” and “State” are defined in 24 CFR part 91. For PHAs, “jurisdiction” is defined in 24 CFR 982.4. The following additional definitions are provided solely for purposes of §§ 5.150 through 5.180 and related amendments in 24 CFR parts 91, 92, 570, 574, 576, and 903:

*Affirmatively furthering fair housing* means taking meaningful actions, in addition to combating discrimination, that overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics. Specifically, affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws. The duty to affirmatively further fair housing extends to all of a program participant's activities and programs relating to housing and urban development.

*Assessment of Fair Housing (assessment or AFH*) means the analysis undertaken pursuant to § 5.154 that includes an analysis of fair housing data, an assessment of fair housing issues and contributing factors, and an identification of fair housing priorities and goals, and is conducted and submitted to HUD using the Assessment Tool. The AFH may be conducted and submitted by an individual program participant (individual AFH), or may be a single AFH conducted and submitted by two or more program participants (joint AFH) or two or more program participants, where at least two of which are consolidated plan program participants (regional AFH).

*Assessment Tool* refers collectively to any forms or templates and the accompanying instructions provided by HUD that program participants must use to conduct and submit an AFH pursuant to § 5.154. HUD may provide different Assessment Tools for different types of program participants. In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35) (PRA), the Assessment Tool will be subject to periodic notice and opportunity to comment in order to maintain the approval of the Assessment Tool as granted by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the PRA.

*Community participation,* as required in § 5.158, means a solicitation of views and recommendations from members of the community and other interested parties, a consideration of the views and recommendations received, and a process for incorporating such views and recommendations into decisions and outcomes. For HUD regulations implementing the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, the statutory term for “community participation” is “citizen participation,” and, therefore, the regulations in 24 CFR parts 91, 92, 570, 574, and 576 use this term.

*Consolidated plan program participant* means any entity specified in § 5.154(b)(1).

*Contributing factor.* See definition of “fair housing contributing factor” in this section.

*Data.* The term “data” refers collectively to the sources of data provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this definition. When identification of the specific source of data in paragraph (1) or (2) is necessary, the specific source (HUD-provided data or local data) will be stated.

(1) *HUD-provided data.* As more fully addressed in the Assessment Tool, the term “HUD-provided data” refers to HUD-provided metrics, statistics, and other quantified information required to be used with the Assessment Tool. HUD-provided data will not only be provided to program participants but will be posted on HUD's Web site for availability to all of the public;

(2) *Local data.* As more fully addressed in the Assessment Tool, the term “local data” refers to metrics, statistics, and other quantified information, subject to a determination of statistical validity by HUD, relevant to the program participant's geographic areas of analysis, that can be found through a reasonable amount of search, are readily available at little or no cost, and are necessary for the completion of the AFH using the Assessment Tool.

*Disability.* (1) The term “disability” means, with respect to an individual:

(i) A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;

(ii) A record of such an impairment; or

(iii) Being regarded as having such an impairment.

(2) The term “disability” as used herein shall be interpreted consistent with the definition of such term under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended by the ADA Amendments Act of 2008. This definition does not change the definition of “disability” or “disabled person” adopted pursuant to a HUD program statute for purposes of determining an individual's eligibility to participate in a housing program that serves a specified population.

*Disproportionate housing needs* refers to a condition in which there are significant disparities in the proportion of members of a protected class experiencing a category of housing need when compared to the proportion of members of any other relevant groups or the total population experiencing that category of housing need in the applicable geographic area. For purposes of this definition, categories of housing need are based on such factors as cost burden, severe cost burden, overcrowding, and substandard housing conditions, as those terms are applied in the Assessment Tool.

*Fair housing choice* means that individuals and families have the information, opportunity, and options to live where they choose without unlawful discrimination and other barriers related to race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or disability. Fair housing choice encompasses:

(1) Actual choice, which means the existence of realistic housing options;

(2) Protected choice, which means housing that can be accessed without discrimination; and

(3) Enabled choice, which means realistic access to sufficient information regarding options so that any choice is informed. For persons with disabilities, fair housing choice and access to opportunity include access to accessible housing and housing in the most integrated setting appropriate to an individual's needs as required under Federal civil rights law, including disability-related services that an individual needs to live in such housing.

*Fair housing contributing factor (or contributing factor)* means a factor that creates, contributes to, perpetuates, or increases the severity of one or more fair housing issues. Goals in an AFH are designed to overcome one or more contributing factors and related fair housing issues, as provided in § 5.154.

*Fair housing issue* means a condition in a program participant's geographic area of analysis that restricts fair housing choice or access to opportunity, and includes such conditions as ongoing local or regional segregation or lack of integration, racially or ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, significant disparities in access to opportunity, disproportionate housing needs, and evidence of discrimination or violations of civil rights law or regulations related to housing. Participation in “housing programs serving specified populations,” as defined in this section, does not present a fair housing issue of segregation, provided that such programs are administered by program participants so that the programs comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), including the duty to affirmatively further fair housing; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, *et seq.*); and other Federal civil rights statutes and regulations.

*Fair housing enforcement and fair housing outreach capacity* means the ability of a jurisdiction, and organizations located in the jurisdiction, to accept complaints of violations of fair housing laws, investigate such complaints, obtain remedies, engage in fair housing testing, and educate community members about fair housing laws and rights. This definition covers any State or local agency that enforces a law substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act (see 24 CFR part 115) and any organization participating in the Fair Housing Initiative Programs (see 24 CFR part 125).

*Geographic area* means a jurisdiction, region, State, Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA), or another applicable area (e.g., census tract, neighborhood, Zip code, block group, housing development, or portion thereof) relevant to the analysis required to complete the assessment of fair housing, as specified in the Assessment Tool.

*Housing programs serving specified populations.* Housing programs serving specified populations are HUD and Federal housing programs, including designations in the programs, as applicable, such as HUD's Supportive Housing for the Elderly, Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities, homeless assistance programs under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11301 *et seq.*), and housing designated under section 7 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437e), that:

(1) Serve specific identified populations; and

(2) Comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs); the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), including the duty to affirmatively further fair housing; section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, *et seq.*); and other Federal civil rights statutes and regulations.

*Insular area* has the same meaning as provided in § 570.405.

*Integration* means a condition, within the program participant's geographic area of analysis, as guided by the Assessment Tool, in which there is not a high concentration of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or having a disability or a particular type of disability when compared to a broader geographic area. For individuals with disabilities, integration also means that such individuals are able to access housing and services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual's needs. The most integrated setting is one that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with persons without disabilities to the fullest extent possible, consistent with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101 *et seq.*) and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). See 28 CFR part 35, appendix B (addressing 28 CFR 35.130 and providing guidance on the American with Disabilities Act regulation on nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in State and local government services).

*Joint participants* refers to two or more program participants conducting and submitting a single AFH (a joint AFH), in accordance with § 5.156 and 24 CFR 903.15(a)(1) and (2), as applicable.

*Local knowledge.* As more fully addressed in the Assessment Tool, local knowledge means information to be provided by the program participant that relates to the participant's geographic areas of analysis and that is relevant to the program participant's AFH, is known or becomes known to the program participant, and is necessary for the completion of the AFH using the Assessment Tool.

*Meaningful actions* means significant actions that are designed and can be reasonably expected to achieve a material positive change that affirmatively furthers fair housing by, for example, increasing fair housing choice or decreasing disparities in access to opportunity.

*Program participants* means any entities specified in § 5.154(b).

*Protected characteristics* are race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, having a disability, and having a type of disability.

*Protected class* means a group of persons who have the same protected characteristic; e.g., a group of persons who are of the same race are a protected class. Similarly, a person who has a mobility disability is a member of the protected class of persons with disabilities and a member of the protected class of persons with mobility disabilities.

*Qualified public housing agency (Qualified PHA).* Refers to a PHA*:*

(1) For which the sum of:

(i) The number of public housing dwelling units administered by the PHA; and

(ii) The number of vouchers under section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)) administered by the PHA is 550 or fewer; and

(2) That is not designated under section 6(j)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 as a troubled PHA, and does not have a failing score under the Section 8 Management Assessment Program (SEMAP) during the prior 12 months.

*Racially or ethnically concentrated area of poverty* means a geographic area with significant concentrations of poverty and minority populations.

*Regionally collaborating participants* refers to joint participants, at least two of which are consolidated plan program participants. A PHA may participate in a regional assessment in accordance with PHA Plan participation requirements under 24 CFR 903.15(a)(1). Regionally collaborating participants conduct and submit a single AFH (regional AFH) in accordance with § 5.156.

*Segregation* means a condition, within the program participant's geographic area of analysis, as guided by the Assessment Tool, in which there is a high concentration of persons of a particular race, color, religion, sex, familial status, national origin, or having a disability or a type of disability in a particular geographic area when compared to a broader geographic area. For persons with disabilities, segregation includes a condition in which the housing or services are not in the most integrated setting appropriate to an individual's needs in accordance with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, *et seq.*), and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). (See 28 CFR part 35, appendix B, addressing 25 CFR 35.130.) Participation in “housing programs serving specified populations” as defined in this section does not present a fair housing issue of segregation, provided that such programs are administered to comply with title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-2000d-4) (Nondiscrimination in Federally Assisted Programs): The Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601-19), including the duty to affirmatively further fair housing: section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794); the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. 12101, *et seq.*); and other Federal civil rights statutes and regulations.

*Significant disparities in access to opportunity* means substantial and measurable differences in access to educational, transportation, economic, and other important opportunities in a community, based on protected class related to housing.
