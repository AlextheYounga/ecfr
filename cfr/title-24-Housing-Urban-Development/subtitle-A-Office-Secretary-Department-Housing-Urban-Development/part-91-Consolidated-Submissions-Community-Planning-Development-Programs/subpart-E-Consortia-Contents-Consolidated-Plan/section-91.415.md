The consortium must set forth its priorities for allocating housing (including CDBG and ESG, where applicable) resources geographically within the consortium, describing how the consolidated plan will address the needs identified (in accordance with ยง 91.405), setting forth strategies and actions consistent with the goals and other elements identified in an AFH conducted in accordance with 24 CFR 5.150 through 5.180, describing the reasons for the consortium's allocation priorities, and identifying any obstacles there are to addressing underserved needs.
