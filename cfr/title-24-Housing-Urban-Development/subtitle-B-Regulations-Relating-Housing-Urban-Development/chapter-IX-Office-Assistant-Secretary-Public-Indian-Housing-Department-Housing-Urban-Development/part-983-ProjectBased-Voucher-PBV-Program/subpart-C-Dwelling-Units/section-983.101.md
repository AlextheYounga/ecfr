##### § 983.101 Housing quality standards. #####

(a) *HQS applicability.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, 24 CFR 982.401 (housing quality standards) applies to the PBV program. The physical condition standards at 24 CFR 5.703 do not apply to the PBV program.

(b) *HQS for special housing types.* For special housing types assisted under the PBV program, HQS in 24 CFR part 982 apply to the PBV program. (Shared housing, manufactured home space rental, and the homeownership option are not assisted under the PBV program.) HQS contained within 24 CFR part 982 that are inapplicable to the PBV program pursuant to § 983.2 are also inapplicable to special housing types under the PBV program.

(c) *Lead-based paint requirements.* (1) The lead-based paint requirements at § 982.401(j) of this chapter do not apply to the PBV program.

(2) The Lead-based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R, apply to the PBV program.

(d) *HQS enforcement.* Parts 982 and 983 of this chapter do not create any right of the family or any party, other than HUD or the PHA, to require enforcement of the HQS requirements or to assert any claim against HUD or the PHA for damages, injunction, or other relief for alleged failure to enforce the HQS.

(e) *Additional PHA quality and design requirements.* This section establishes the minimum federal housing quality standards for PBV housing. However, the PHA may elect to establish additional requirements for quality, architecture, or design of PBV housing, and any such additional requirements must be specified in the Agreement.
