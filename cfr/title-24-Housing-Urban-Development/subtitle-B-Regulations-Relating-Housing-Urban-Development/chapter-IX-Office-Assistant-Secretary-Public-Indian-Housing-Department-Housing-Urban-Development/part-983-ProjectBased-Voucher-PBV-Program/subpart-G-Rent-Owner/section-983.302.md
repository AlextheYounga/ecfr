##### § 983.302 Redetermination of rent to owner. #####

(a) The PHA must redetermine the rent to owner:

(1) Upon the owner's request; or

(2) When there is a 10 percent decrease in the published FMR.

(b) *Rent increase.* (1) The PHA may not make any rent increase other than an increase in the rent to owner as determined pursuant to § 983.301. (Provisions for special adjustments of contract rent pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1437f(b)(2)(B) do not apply to the voucher program.)

(2) The owner must request an increase in the rent to owner at the annual anniversary of the HAP contract by written notice to the PHA. The length of the required notice period of the owner request for a rent increase at the annual anniversary may be established by the PHA. The request must be submitted in the form and manner required by the PHA.

(3) The PHA may not approve and the owner may not receive any increase of rent to owner until and unless the owner has complied with all requirements of the HAP contract, including compliance with the HQS. The owner may not receive any retroactive increase of rent for any period of noncompliance.

(c) *Rent decrease.* (1) If there is a decrease in the rent to owner, as established in accordance with § 983.301, the rent to owner must be decreased, regardless of whether the owner requested a rent adjustment.

(2) If the PHA has elected within the HAP contract to not reduce rents below the initial rent to owner, the rent to owner shall not be reduced below the initial rent to owner for dwelling units under the initial HAP contract, except:

(i) To correct errors in calculations in accordance with HUD requirements;

(ii) If additional housing assistance has been combined with PBV assistance after the execution of the initial HAP contract and a rent decrease is required pursuant to § 983.55; or

(iii) If a decrease in rent to owner is required based on changes in the allocation of responsibility for utilities between the owner and the tenant.

(d) *Notice of rent redetermination.* Rent to owner is redetermined by written notice by the PHA to the owner specifying the amount of the redetermined rent (as determined in accordance with §§ 983.301 and 983.302). The PHA notice of the rent adjustment constitutes an amendment of the rent to owner specified in the HAP contract.

(e) *Contract year and annual anniversary of the HAP contract.* (1) The contract year is the period of 12 calendar months preceding each annual anniversary of the HAP contract during the HAP contract term. The initial contract year is calculated from the first day of the first calendar month of the HAP contract term.

(2) The annual anniversary of the HAP contract is the first day of the first calendar month after the end of the preceding contract year. The adjusted rent to owner amount applies for the period of 12 calendar months from the annual anniversary of the HAP contract.

(3) See § 983.207(c) for information on the annual anniversary of the HAP contract for contract units completed in stages.
