##### § 983.301 Determining the rent to owner. #####

(a) *Initial and redetermined rents.* (1) The amount of the initial and redetermined rent to owner is determined in accordance with this section and § 983.302.

(2) The amount of the initial rent to owner is established at the beginning of the HAP contract term. For rehabilitated or newly constructed housing, the Agreement states the estimated amount of the initial rent to owner, but the actual amount of the initial rent to owner is established at the beginning of the HAP contract term.

(3) The rent to owner is also redetermined in accordance with § 983.302.

(b) *Amount of rent to owner.* Except for certain tax credit units as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the rent to owner must not exceed the lowest of:

(1) An amount determined by the PHA, not to exceed 110 percent of the applicable fair market rent (or any exception payment standard approved by the Secretary) for the unit bedroom size minus any utility allowance;

(2) The reasonable rent; or

(3) The rent requested by the owner.

(c) *Rent to owner for certain tax credit units.* (1) This paragraph (c) applies if:

(i) A contract unit receives a low-income housing tax credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (see 26 U.S.C. 42);

(ii) The contract unit is not located in a qualified census tract;

(iii) In the same building, there are comparable tax credit units of the same unit bedroom size as the contract unit and the comparable tax credit units do not have any form of rental assistance other than the tax credit; and

(iv) The tax credit rent exceeds the applicable fair market rental (or any exception payment standard) as determined in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) In the case of a contract unit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the rent to owner must not exceed the lowest of:

(i) The tax credit rent minus any utility allowance;

(ii) The reasonable rent; or

(iii) The rent requested by the owner.

(3) The “tax credit rent” is the rent charged for comparable units of the same bedroom size in the building that also receive the low-income housing tax credit but do not have any additional rental assistance (*e.g.*, additional assistance such as tenant-based voucher assistance).

(4) A “qualified census tract” is any census tract (or equivalent geographic area defined by the Bureau of the Census) in which:

(i) At least 50 percent of households have an income of less than 60 percent of Area Median Gross Income (AMGI); or

(ii) Where the poverty rate is at least 25 percent and where the census tract is designated as a qualified census tract by HUD.

(d) *Rent to owner for other tax credit units.* Except in the case of a tax-credit unit described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the rent to owner for all other tax credit units may be determined by the PHA pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

(e) *Reasonable rent.* The PHA shall determine the reasonable rent in accordance with § 983.303. The rent to the owner for each contract unit may at no time exceed the reasonable rent, except in cases where, the PHA has elected within the HAP contract not to reduce rents below the initial rent to owner and, upon redetermination of the rent to owner, the reasonable rent would result in a rent below the initial rent. If the PHA has not elected within the HAP contract to establish the initial rent to owner as the rent floor, the rent to owner shall not at any time exceed the reasonable rent.

(f) *Use of FMRs and utility allowance schedule in determining the amount of rent to owner*—(1) *Amounts used.* (i) *Determination of initial rent (at beginning of HAP contract term).* When determining the initial rent to owner, the PHA shall use the most recently published FMR in effect and the utility allowance schedule in effect at execution of the HAP contract. At its discretion, the PHA may use the amounts in effect at any time during the 30-day period immediately before the beginning date of the HAP contract.

(ii) *Redetermination of rent to owner.* When redetermining the rent to owner, the PHA shall use the most recently published FMR and the PHA utility allowance schedule in effect at the time of redetermination. At its discretion, the PHA may use the amounts in effect at any time during the 30-day period immediately before the redetermination date.

(2) *Exception payment standard and PHA utility allowance schedule.* (i) Any HUD-approved exception payment standard amount under 24 CFR 982.503(c) applies to both the tenant-based and project-based voucher programs. HUD will not approve a different exception payment standard amount for use in the PBV program.

(ii) The PHA may not establish or apply different utility allowance amounts for the PBV program. The same PHA utility allowance schedule applies to both the tenant-based and PBV programs.

(g) *PHA-owned units.* For PHA-owned PBV units, the initial rent to owner and the annual redetermination of rent at the annual anniversary of the HAP contract are determined by the independent entity approved by HUD in accordance with § 983.59. The PHA must use the rent to owner established by the independent entity.
