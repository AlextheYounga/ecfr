##### § 983.5 Description of the PBV program. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 38306, May 7, 2024.

(a) *How PBV works.* (1) The PBV program is administered by a PHA that already administers the tenant-based voucher program under an annual contributions contract (ACC) with HUD. In the PBV program, the assistance is “attached to the structure.” (See description of the difference between “project-based” and “tenant-based” rental assistance at 24 CFR 982.1(b).)

(2) The PHA enters into a HAP contract with an owner for units in existing housing or in newly constructed or rehabilitated housing.

(3) In the case of newly constructed or rehabilitated housing, the housing is developed under an Agreement between the owner and the PHA. In the Agreement, the PHA agrees to execute a HAP contract after the owner completes the construction or rehabilitation of the units.

(4) During the term of the HAP contract, the PHA makes housing assistance payments to the owner for units leased and occupied by eligible families.

(b) *How PBV is funded.* (1) If a PHA decides to operate a PBV program, the PHA's PBV program is funded with a portion of appropriated funding (budget authority) available under the PHA's voucher ACC. This pool of funding is used to pay housing assistance for both tenant-based and project-based voucher units and to pay PHA administrative fees for administration of tenant-based and project-based voucher assistance.

(2) There is no special or additional funding for project-based vouchers. HUD does not reserve additional units for project-based vouchers and does not provide any additional funding for this purpose.

(c) *PHA discretion to operate PBV program.* A PHA has discretion whether to operate a PBV program. HUD approval is not required, except that the PHA must notify HUD of its intent to project-base its vouchers, in accordance with § 983.6(d).
