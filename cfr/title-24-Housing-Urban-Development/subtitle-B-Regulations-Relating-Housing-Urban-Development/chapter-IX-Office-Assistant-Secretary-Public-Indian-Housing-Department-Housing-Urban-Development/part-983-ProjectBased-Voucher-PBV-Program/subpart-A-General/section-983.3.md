##### § 983.3 PBV definitions. #####

(a) *Use of PBV definitions*—(1) *PBV terms (defined in this section).* This section defines PBV terms that are used in this part 983. For PBV assistance, the definitions in this section apply to use of the defined terms in part 983 and in applicable provisions of 24 CFR part 982. (Section 983.2 specifies which provisions in part 982 apply to PBV assistance under part 983.)

(2) *Other voucher terms (terms defined in 24 CFR 982.4).* (i) The definitions in this section apply instead of definitions of the same terms in 24 CFR 982.4.

(ii) Other voucher terms are defined in § 982.4, but are not defined in this section. Those § 982.4 definitions apply to use of the defined terms in this part 983 and in provisions of part 982 that apply to part 983.

(b) *PBV definitions. 1937 Act.* The United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437 *et seq.*).

*Activities of daily living.* Eating, bathing, grooming, dressing, and home management activities.

*Admission.* The point when the family becomes a participant in the PHA's tenant-based or project-based voucher program (initial receipt of tenant-based or project-based assistance). After admission, and so long as the family is continuously assisted with tenant-based or project-based voucher assistance from the PHA, a shift from tenant-based or project-based assistance to the other form of voucher assistance is not a new admission.

*Agreement to enter into HAP contract (Agreement).* The Agreement is a written contract between the PHA and the owner in the form prescribed by HUD. The Agreement defines requirements for development of housing to be assisted under this section. When development is completed by the owner in accordance with the Agreement, the PHA enters into a HAP contract with the owner. The Agreement is not used for existing housing assisted under this section. HUD will keep the public informed about changes to the Agreement and other forms and contracts related to this program through appropriate means.

*Assisted living facility.* A residence facility (including a facility located in a larger multifamily property) that meets all the following criteria:

(1) The facility is licensed and regulated as an assisted living facility by the state, municipality, or other political subdivision;

(2) The facility makes available supportive services to assist residents in carrying out activities of daily living; and

(3) The facility provides separate dwelling units for residents and includes common rooms and other facilities appropriate and actually available to provide supportive services for the residents.

*Comparable rental assistance.* A subsidy or other means to enable a family to obtain decent housing in the PHA jurisdiction renting at a gross rent that is not more than 40 percent of the family's adjusted monthly gross income.

*Contract units.* The housing units covered by a HAP contract.

*Covered housing provider.* For Project-Based Voucher (PBV) program, “covered housing provider,” as such term is used in HUD's regulations in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) refers to the PHA or owner (as defined in 24 CFR 982.4), as applicable given the responsibilities of the covered housing provider as set forth in 24 CFR part 5, subpart L. For example, the PHA is the covered housing provider responsible for providing the notice of occupancy rights under VAWA and certification form described at 24 CFR 5.2005(a). In addition, the owner is the covered housing provider that may choose to bifurcate a lease as described at 24 CFR 5.2009(a), while the PHA is the covered housing provider responsible for complying with emergency transfer plan provisions at 24 CFR 5.2005(e).

*Development.* Construction or rehabilitation of PBV housing after the proposal selection date.

*Excepted units* (units in a multifamily project not counted against the 25 percent per- project cap). See § 983.56(b)(2)(i).

*Existing housing.* Housing units that already exist on the proposal selection date and that substantially comply with the HQS on that date. (The units must fully comply with the HQS before execution of the HAP contract.)

*Household.* The family and any PHA-approved live-in aide.

*Housing assistance payment.* The monthly assistance payment for a PBV unit by a PHA, which includes:

(1) A payment to the owner for rent to owner under the family's lease minus the tenant rent; and

(2) An additional payment to or on behalf of the family, if the utility allowance exceeds the total tenant payment, in the amount of such excess.

*Housing credit agency.* For purposes of performing subsidy layering reviews for proposed PBV projects, a housing credit agency includes a State housing finance agency, a State participating jurisdiction under HUD's HOME program (see 24 CFR part 92), or other State housing agencies that meet the definition of “housing credit agency” as defined by section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

*Housing quality standards (HQS).* The minimum quality standards developed by HUD in accordance with 24 CFR 5.703 for the PBV program or the HUD approved alternative standard for the PHA under 24 CFR 5.703(g).

*Lease.* A written agreement between an owner and a tenant for the leasing of a PBV dwelling unit by the owner to the tenant. The lease establishes the conditions for occupancy of the dwelling unit by a family with housing assistance payments under a HAP contract between the owner and the PHA.

*Multifamily building.* A building with five or more dwelling units (assisted or unassisted).

*Newly constructed housing.* Housing units that do not exist on the proposal selection date and are developed after the date of selection pursuant to an Agreement between the PHA and owner for use under the PBV program.

*Partially assisted project.* A project in which there are fewer contract units than residential units.

*PHA-owned unit.* A dwelling unit owned by the PHA that administers the voucher program. PHA-owned means that the PHA or its officers, employees, or agents hold a direct or indirect interest in the building in which the unit is located, including an interest as titleholder or lessee, or as a stockholder, member or general or limited partner, or member of a limited liability corporation, or an entity that holds any such direct or indirect interest.

*Proposal selection date.* The date the PHA gives written notice of PBV proposal selection to an owner whose proposal is selected in accordance with the criteria established in the PHA's administrative plan.

*Qualifying families* (for purpose of exception to 25 percent per-project cap). See § 983.56(b)(2)(ii).

*Rehabilitated housing.* Housing units that exist on the proposal selection date, but do not substantially comply with the HQS on that date, and are developed, pursuant to an Agreement between the PHA and owner, for use under the PBV program.

*Release of funds* (for purposes of environmental review). Release of funds in the case of the project-based voucher program, under 24 CFR 58.1(b)(6)(iii) and § 983.58, means that HUD approves the local PHA's Request for Release of Funds and Certification by issuing a Letter to Proceed (in lieu of using form HUD-7015.16) that authorizes the PHA to execute an “agreement to enter into housing assistance payment contract” (AHAP) or, for existing housing, to directly enter into a HAP with an owner of units selected under the PBV program.

*Rent to owner.* The total monthly rent payable by the family and the PHA to the owner under the lease for a contract unit. Rent to owner includes payment for any housing services, maintenance, and utilities to be provided by the owner in accordance with the lease. (Rent to owner must not include charges for non-housing services including payment for food, furniture, or supportive services provided in accordance with the lease.)

*Responsible entity (RE) (for environmental review).* The unit of general local government within which the project is located that exercises land use responsibility or, if HUD determines this infeasible, the county or, if HUD determines that infeasible, the state.

Subpart M provisions on shared housing, manufactured home space rental, and the homeownership option do not apply to PBV assistance under this part.

*Total tenant payment.* The amount described in 24 CFR 5.628.

*Utility reimbursement.* See 24 CFR 5.603.
