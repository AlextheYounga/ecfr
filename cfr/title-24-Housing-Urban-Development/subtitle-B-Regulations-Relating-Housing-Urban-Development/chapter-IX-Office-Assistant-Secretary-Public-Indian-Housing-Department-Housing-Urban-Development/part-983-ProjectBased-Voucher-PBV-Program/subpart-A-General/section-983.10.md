##### § 983.10 Project-based certificate (PBC) program. #####

(a) *What is it?* “PBC program” means project-based assistance attached to units pursuant to an Agreement executed by a PHA and owner before January 16, 2001, and in accordance with:

(1) The regulations for the PBC program at 24 CFR part 983, codified as of May 1, 2001 and contained in 24 CFR part 983 revised as of April 1, 2002; and

(2) Section 8(d)(2) of the 1937 Act, as in effect before October 21, 1998 (the date of enactment of Title V of Public Law 105-276, the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, codified at 42 U.S.C. 1437 *et seq.*).

(b) *What rules apply?* Units under the PBC program are subject to the provisions of 24 CFR part 983, codified as of May 1, 2001, with the following exceptions:

(1) *PBC renewals.* (i) *General.* Consistent with the PBC HAP contract, at the sole option of the PHA, HAP contracts may be renewed for terms for an aggregate total (including the initial and any renewal terms) of 15 years, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.

(ii) *Renewal of PBC as PBV.* At the sole discretion of the PHA, upon the request of an owner, PHAs may renew a PBC HAP contract as a PBV HAP contract. All PBV regulations (including 24 CFR part 983, subpart G—Rent to Owner) apply to a PBC HAP contract renewed as a PBV HAP contract with the exception of §§ 983.51, 983.56, and 983.57(b)(1). In addition, the following conditions apply:

(A) The term of the HAP contract for PBC contracts renewed as PBV contracts shall be consistent with § 983.205.

(B) A PHA must make the determination, within one year before expiration of a PBC HAP contract, that renewal of the contract under the PBV program is appropriate to continue providing affordable housing for low-income families.

(C) The renewal of PBC assistance as PBV assistance is effectuated by the execution of a PBV HAP contract addendum as prescribed by HUD and a PBV HAP contract for existing housing.

(2) *Housing quality standards.* The regulations in 24 CFR 982.401 (housing quality standards) (HQS) apply to units assisted under the PBC program.

(i) *Special housing types.* HQS requirements for eligible special housing types, under this program, apply (See 24 CFR 982.605. 982.609 and 982.614).

(ii) *Lead-based paint requirements.* (A) The lead-based paint requirements at 24 CFR 982.401(j) do not apply to the PBC program.

(B) The Lead-based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations at 24 CFR part 35, subparts A, B, H, and R, apply to the PBV program.

(iii) *HQS enforcement.* The regulations in 24 CFR parts 982 and 983 do not create any right of the family or any party, other than HUD or the PHA, to require enforcement of the HQS requirements or to assert any claim against HUD or the PHA for damages, injunction, or other relief for alleged failure to enforce the HQS.

(c) *Statutory notice requirements.* In addition to provisions of 24 CFR part 983 codified as of May 1, 2001, § 983.206 applies to the PBC program.
