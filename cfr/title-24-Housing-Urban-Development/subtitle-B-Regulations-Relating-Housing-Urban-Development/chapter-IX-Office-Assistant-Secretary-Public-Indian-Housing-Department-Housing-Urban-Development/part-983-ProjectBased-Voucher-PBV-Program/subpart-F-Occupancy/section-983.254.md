(a) *Filling vacant units.* (1) The owner must promptly notify the PHA of any vacancy or expected vacancy in a contract unit. After receiving the owner notice, the PHA must make every reasonable effort to refer promptly a sufficient number of families for the owner to fill such vacancies.

(2) The owner must lease vacant contract units only to eligible families on the PHA waiting list referred by the PHA.

(3) The PHA and the owner must make reasonable good faith efforts to minimize the likelihood and length of any vacancy.

(b) *Reducing number of contract units.* If any contract units have been vacant for a period of 120 or more days since owner notice of vacancy (and notwithstanding the reasonable good faith efforts of the PHA to fill such vacancies), the PHA may give notice to the owner amending the HAP contract to reduce the number of contract units by subtracting the number of contract units (by number of bedrooms) that have been vacant for such period.
