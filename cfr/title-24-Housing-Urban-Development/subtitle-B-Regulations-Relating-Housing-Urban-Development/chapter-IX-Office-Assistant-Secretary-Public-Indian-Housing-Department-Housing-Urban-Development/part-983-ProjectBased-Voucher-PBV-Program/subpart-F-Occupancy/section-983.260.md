(a) *Family occupancy of wrong-size or accessible unit.* The PHA subsidy standards determine the appropriate unit size for the family size and composition. If the PHA determines that a family is occupying a:

(1) Wrong-size unit, or

(2) Unit with accessibility features that the family does not require, and the unit is needed by a family that requires the accessibility features, the PHA must promptly notify the family and the owner of this determination, and of the PHA's offer of continued assistance in another unit pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) *PHA offer of continued assistance.* (1) If a family is occupying a:

(i) Wrong-size unit, or

(ii) Unit with accessibility features that the family does not require, and the unit is needed by a family that requires the accessibility features, the PHA must offer the family the opportunity to receive continued housing assistance in another unit.

(2) The PHA policy on such continued housing assistance must be stated in the administrative plan and may be in the form of:

(i) Project-based voucher assistance in an appropriate-size unit (in the same project or in another project);

(ii) Other project-based housing assistance (*e.g.*, by occupancy of a public housing unit);

(iii) Tenant-based rental assistance under the voucher program; or

(iv) Other comparable public or private tenant-based assistance (*e.g.*, under the HOME program).

(c) *PHA termination of housing assistance payments.* (1) If the PHA offers the family the opportunity to receive tenant-based rental assistance under the voucher program, the PHA must terminate the housing assistance payments for a wrong-sized or accessible unit at the earlier of the expiration of the term of the family's voucher (including any extension granted by the PHA) or the date upon which the family vacates the unit. If the family does not move out of the wrong-sized unit or accessible unit by the expiration date of the term of the family's voucher, the PHA must remove the unit from the HAP contract.

(2) If the PHA offers the family the opportunity for another form of continued housing assistance in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section (not in the tenant-based voucher program), and the family does not accept the offer, does not move out of the PBV unit within a reasonable time as determined by the PHA, or both, the PHA must terminate the housing assistance payments for the wrong-sized or accessible unit, at the expiration of a reasonable period as determined by the PHA, and remove the unit from the HAP contract.
