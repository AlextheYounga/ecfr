(a) In general. 24 CFR 982.310 applies with the exception that § 982.310(d)(1)(iii) and (iv) do not apply to the PBV program. (In the PBV program, “good cause” does not include a business or economic reason or desire to use the unit for an individual, family, or non-residential rental purpose.) 24 CFR 5.858 through 5.861 on eviction for drug and alcohol abuse apply to this part. 24 CFR part 5, subpart L (Protection for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking) applies to this part.

(b) If a family resides in a project-based unit excepted from the 25 percent per-project cap on project-basing because of participation in an FSS or other supportive services program, and the family fails without good cause to complete its FSS contract of participation or supportive services requirement, such failure is grounds for lease termination by the owner.
