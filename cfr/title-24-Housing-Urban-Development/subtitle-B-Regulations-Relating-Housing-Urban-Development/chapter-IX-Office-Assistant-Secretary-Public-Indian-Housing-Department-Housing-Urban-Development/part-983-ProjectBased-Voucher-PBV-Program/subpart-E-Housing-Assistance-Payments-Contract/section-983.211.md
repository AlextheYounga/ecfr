(b) If the project is fully assisted, a PHA may reinstate the unit removed under paragraph (a) of this section to the HAP contract after the ineligible family vacates the property. If the project is partially assisted, a PHA may substitute a different unit for the unit removed under paragraph (a) of this section to the HAP contract when the first eligible substitute becomes available.

(c) A reinstatement or substitution of units under the HAP contract, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, must be permissible under § 983.207. The anniversary and expirations dates of the HAP contract for the unit must be the same as it was when it was originally placed under the HAP contract. The PHA must refer eligible families to the owner in accordance with the PHA's selection policies.
