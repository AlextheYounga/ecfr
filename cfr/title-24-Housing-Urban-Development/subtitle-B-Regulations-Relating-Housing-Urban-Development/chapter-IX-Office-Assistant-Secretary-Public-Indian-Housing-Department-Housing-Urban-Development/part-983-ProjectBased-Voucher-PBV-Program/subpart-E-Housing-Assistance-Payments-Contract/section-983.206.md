Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 38325, May 7, 2024.

(a) Notices required in accordance with this section must be provided in the form prescribed by HUD.

(b) Not less than one year before termination of a PBV or PBC HAP contract, the owner must notify the PHA and assisted tenants of the termination.

(c) For purposes of this section, the term “termination” means the expiration of the HAP contract or an owner's refusal to renew the HAP contract.

(d)(1) If an owner does not give timely notice of termination, the owner must permit the tenants in assisted units to remain in their units for the required notice period with no increase in the tenant portion of their rent, and with no eviction as a result of an owner's inability to collect an increased tenant portion of rent.

(2) An owner may renew the terminating contract for a period of time sufficient to give tenants one-year advance notice under such terms as HUD may require.
