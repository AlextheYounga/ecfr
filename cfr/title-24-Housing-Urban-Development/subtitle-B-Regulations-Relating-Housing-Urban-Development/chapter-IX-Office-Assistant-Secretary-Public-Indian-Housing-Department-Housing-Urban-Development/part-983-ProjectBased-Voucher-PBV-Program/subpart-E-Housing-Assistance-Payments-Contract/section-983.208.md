##### § 983.208 Condition of contract units. #####

(a) *Owner maintenance and operation.* (1) The owner must maintain and operate the contract units and premises in accordance with the HQS, including performance of ordinary and extraordinary maintenance.

(2) The owner must provide all the services, maintenance, equipment, and utilities specified in the HAP contract with the PHA and in the lease with each assisted family.

(3) At the discretion of the PHA, the HAP contract may also require continuing owner compliance during the HAP term with additional housing quality requirements specified by the PHA (in addition to, but not in place of, compliance with the HUD-prescribed HQS). Such additional requirements may be designed to assure continued compliance with any design, architecture, or quality requirement specified in the Agreement.

(b) *Remedies for HQS violation.* (1) The PHA must vigorously enforce the owner's obligation to maintain contract units in accordance with the HQS. The PHA may not make any HAP payment to the owner for a contract unit covering any period during which the contract unit does not comply with the HQS.

(2) If the PHA determines that a contract unit is not in accordance with the housing quality standards (or other HAP contract requirement), the PHA may exercise any of its remedies under the HAP contract for all or any contract units. Such remedies include termination of housing assistance payments, abatement or reduction of housing assistance payments, reduction of contract units, and termination of the HAP contract.

(c) *Maintenance and replacement—Owner's standard practice.* Maintenance and replacement (including redecoration) must be in accordance with the standard practice for the building concerned as established by the owner.
