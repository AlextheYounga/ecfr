##### § 983.56 Cap on number of PBV units in each project. #####

(a) *25 percent per project cap.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the PHA may not select a proposal to provide PBV assistance for units in a project or enter into an Agreement or HAP contract to provide PBV assistance for units in a project, if the total number of dwelling units in the project that will receive PBV assistance during the term of the PBV HAP is more than 25 percent of the number of dwelling units (assisted or unassisted) in the project.

(b) *Exception to 25 percent per building cap*—(1) *When PBV units are not counted against cap.* In the following cases, PBV units are not counted against the 25 percent per project cap:

(i) Units in a single-family building;

(ii) Excepted units in a multifamily project.

(2) Terms (i) “Excepted units” means units in a multifamily project that are specifically made available for qualifying families.

(ii) “Qualifying families” means:

(A) Elderly and/or disabled families; and/or

(B) Families receiving supportive services. PHAs must include in the PHA administrative plan the type of services offered to families for a project to qualify for the exception and the extent to which such services will be provided. It is not necessary that the services be provided at or by the project, if they are approved services. To qualify, a family must have at least one member receiving at least one qualifying supportive service. A PHA may not require participation in medical or disability-related services other than drug and alcohol treatment in the case of current abusers as a condition of living in an excepted unit, although such services may be offered. If a family at the time of initial tenancy is receiving, and while the resident of an excepted unit has received, FSS supportive services or any other supportive services as defined in the PHA administrative plan, and successfully completes the FSS contract of participation or the supportive services requirement, the unit continues to count as an excepted unit for as long as the family resides in the unit. If a family in an excepted unit fails without good cause to complete its FSS contract of participation or if the family fails to complete the supportive services requirement as outlined in the PHA administrative plan, the PHA will take the actions provided under § 983.262(d), and the owner may terminate the lease in accordance with § 983.257(c). Also, at the time of initial lease execution between the family and the owner, the family and the PHA must sign a statement of family responsibility. The statement of family responsibility must contain all family obligations including the family's participation in a service program under this section. Failure by the family without good cause to fulfill its service obligation will require the PHA to terminate assistance. If the unit at the time of such termination is an excepted unit, the exception continues to apply to the unit as long as the unit is made available to another qualifying family.

(C) The PHA must monitor the excepted family's continued receipt of supportive services and take appropriate action regarding those families that fail without good cause to complete their supportive services requirement. The PHA administrative plan must state the form and frequency of such monitoring.

(3) *Combining exception categories.* Exception categories in a multifamily housing project may be combined.

(4) *Set-aside for qualifying families.* (i) In leasing units in a multifamily project pursuant to the PBV HAP, the owner must set aside the number of excepted units made available for occupancy by qualifying families.

(ii) The PHA may refer only qualifying families for occupancy of excepted units.

(c) *Additional, local requirements promoting partially assisted projects.* A PHA may establish local requirements designed to promote PBV assistance in partially assisted projects. For example, a PHA may:

(1) Establish a per-project cap on the number of units that will receive PBV assistance or other project-based assistance in a multifamily project containing excepted units or in a single-family building,

(2) Determine not to provide PBV assistance for excepted units, or

(3) Establish a per-project cap of less than 25 percent.
