##### § 982.406 Use of alternative inspections. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 38298, May 7, 2024.

(a) *In general.* (1) A PHA may comply with the inspection requirement in § 982.405(a) by relying on an alternative inspection (*i.e.,* an inspection conducted for another housing assistance program) only if the PHA is able to obtain the results of the alternative inspection.

(2) If an alternative inspection method employs sampling, then a PHA may rely on such alternative inspection method to comply with the requirement in § 982.405(a) only if HCV units are included in the population of units forming the basis of the sample.

(3) Units in properties that are mixed-finance properties assisted with project-based vouchers may be inspected at least triennially pursuant to 24 CFR 983.103(g).

(b) *Administrative plans.* A PHA relying on an alternative inspection to fulfill the requirement in § 982.405(a) must identify the alternative inspection method being used in the PHA's administrative plan. Such a change may be a significant amendment to the plan, in which case the PHA must follow its plan amendment and public notice requirements, in addition to meeting the requirements in § 982.406(c)(2), if applicable, before using the alternative inspection method.

(c) *Eligible inspection methods.* (1) A PHA may rely upon inspections of housing assisted under the HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME) program or housing financed using Low-Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTCs), or inspections performed by HUD, with no action other than amending its administrative plan.

(2) If a PHA wishes to rely on an inspection method other than a method listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, then, prior to amending its administrative plan, the PHA must submit to the Real Estate Assessment Center (REAC) a copy of the inspection method it wishes to use, along with its analysis of the inspection method that shows that the method “provides the same or greater protection to occupants of dwelling units” as would HQS.

(i) A PHA may rely upon such alternative inspection method only upon receiving approval from REAC to do so.

(ii) A PHA that uses an alternative inspection method approved under this paragraph must monitor changes to the standards and requirements applicable to such method. If any change is made to the alternative inspection method, then the PHA must submit to REAC a copy of the revised standards and requirements, along with a revised comparison to HQS. If the PHA or REAC determines that the revision would cause the alternative inspection to no longer meet or exceed HQS, then the PHA may no longer rely upon the alternative inspection method to comply with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a).

(d) *Results of alternative inspection.* (1) In order for a PHA to rely upon the results of an alternative inspection to comply with the requirement at § 982.405(a), a property inspected pursuant to such method must meet the standards or requirements regarding housing quality or safety applicable to properties assisted under the program using the alternative inspection method. To make the determination of whether such standards or requirements are met, the PHA must adhere to the following procedures:

(i) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method, and the property receives a “pass” score, then the PHA may rely on that inspection to demonstrate compliance with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a).

(ii) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method, and the property receives a “fail” score, then the PHA may not rely on that inspection to demonstrate compliance with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a).

(iii) If a property is inspected under an alternative inspection method that does not employ a pass/fail determination—for example, in the case of a program where deficiencies are simply identified—then the PHA must review the list of deficiencies to determine whether any cited deficiency would have resulted in a “fail” score under HQS. If no such deficiency exists, then the PHA may rely on the inspection to demonstrate compliance with the inspection requirement at § 982.405(a); if such a deficiency does exist, then the PHA may not rely on the inspection to demonstrate such compliance.

(2) Under any circumstance described above in which a PHA is prohibited from relying on an alternative inspection method for a property, the PHA must, within a reasonable period of time, conduct an HQS inspection of any units in the property occupied by voucher program participants and follow HQS procedures to remedy any identified deficiencies.

(e) *Records retention.* As with all other inspection reports, and as required by § 982.158(f)(4), reports for inspections conducted pursuant to an alternative inspection method must be obtained by the PHA. Such reports must be available for HUD inspection for at least three years from the date of the latest inspection.
