##### § 982.405 PHA initial and periodic unit inspection. #####

(a)(1) *General requirements.* The PHA must inspect the unit leased to a family prior to the initial term of the lease, at least biennially during assisted occupancy, and at other times as needed, to determine if the unit meets the HQS. (*See* § 982.305(b)(2) concerning timing of initial inspection by the PHA.)

(2) *Small rural PHAs.* Instead of biennially, a small rural PHA as defined in § 902.101 of this chapter must inspect a unit during occupancy at least once every three years.

(b) The PHA must conduct supervisory quality control HQS inspections.

(c) In scheduling inspections, the PHA must consider complaints and any other information brought to the attention of the PHA.

(d) The PHA must notify the owner of defects shown by the inspection.

(e) The PHA may not charge the family for an initial inspection or reinspection of the unit.

(f) The PHA may not charge the owner for the inspection of the unit prior to the initial term of the lease or for a first inspection during assisted occupancy of the unit. The PHA may establish a reasonable fee to owners for a reinspection if an owner notifies the PHA that a repair has been made or the allotted time for repairs has elapsed and a reinspection reveals that any deficiency cited in the previous inspection that the owner is responsible for repairing pursuant to § 982.404(a) was not corrected. The owner may not pass this fee along to the family. Fees collected under this paragraph will be included in a PHA's administrative fee reserve and may be used only for activities related to the provision of Section 8 Tenant-Based Rental Assistance.

(g) If a participant family or government official reports a condition that is life-threatening (*i.e.,* the PHA would require the owner to make the repair within no more than 24 hours in accordance with § 982.404(a)(3)), then the PHA must inspect the housing unit within 24 hours of when the PHA received the notification. If the reported condition is not life-threatening (*i.e.,* the PHA would require the owner to make the repair within no more than 30 calendar days in accordance with § 982.404(a)(3)), then the PHA must inspect the unit within 15 days of when the PHA received the notification. In the event of extraordinary circumstances, such as if a unit is within a Presidentially declared disaster area, HUD may waive the 24-hour or the 15-day inspection requirement until such time as an inspection is feasible.
