##### § 982.505 How to calculate housing assistance payment. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 80582, November 16, 2016.

(a) *Use of payment standard.* A payment standard is used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for a family. The “payment standard” is the maximum monthly subsidy payment.

(b) *Amount of monthly housing assistance payment.* The PHA shall pay a monthly housing assistance payment on behalf of the family that is equal to the *lower* of:

(1) The payment standard for the family minus the total tenant payment; or

(2) The gross rent minus the total tenant payment.

(c) *Payment standard for family.* (1) The payment standard for the family is the lower of:

(i) The payment standard amount for the family unit size; or

(ii) The payment standard amount for the size of the dwelling unit rented by the family.

(2) If the PHA has established a separate payment standard amount for a designated part of an FMR area in accordance with § 982.503 (including an exception payment standard amount as determined in accordance with § 982.503(b)(2) and § 982.503(c)), and the dwelling unit is located in such designated part, the PHA must use the appropriate payment standard amount for such designated part to calculate the payment standard for the family. The payment standard for the family shall be calculated in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(3) *Decrease in the payment standard amount during the HAP contract term.* If the amount on the payment standard schedule is decreased during the term of the HAP contract, the lower payment standard amount generally must be used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family beginning at the effective date of the family's second regular reexamination following the effective date of the decrease in the payment standard amount. The PHA must determine the payment standard for the family as follows.

(i) *Step 1:* At the first regular reexamination following the decrease in the payment standard amount, the PHA shall determine the payment standard for the family in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section (using the decreased payment standard amount).

(ii) *Step 2* (first reexamination payment standard amount): The PHA shall compare the payment standard amount from step 1 to the payment standard amount last used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family. The payment standard amount used by the PHA to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment at the first regular reexamination following the decrease in the payment standard amount is the higher of these two payment standard amounts. The PHA shall advise the family that the application of the lower payment standard amount will be deferred until the second regular reexamination following the effective date of the decrease in the payment standard amount.

(iii) *Step 3* (second reexamination payment standard amount): At the second regular reexamination following the decrease in the payment standard amount, the lower payment standard amount shall be used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family unless the PHA has subsequently increased the payment standard amount, in which case the payment standard amount is determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(4) of this section.

(4) *Increase in the payment standard amount during the HAP contract term.* If the payment standard amount is increased during the term of the HAP contract, the increased payment standard amount shall be used to calculate the monthly housing assistance payment for the family beginning at the effective date of the family's first regular reexamination on or after the effective date of the increase in the payment standard amount.

(5) *Change in family unit size during the HAP contract term.* Irrespective of any increase or decrease in the payment standard amount, if the family unit size increases or decreases during the HAP contract term, the new family unit size must be used to determine the payment standard amount for the family beginning at the family's first regular reexamination following the change in family unit size.

(d) *PHA approval of higher payment standard for the family as a reasonable accommodation.* If the family includes a person with disabilities and requires a payment standard above the basic range, as a reasonable accommodation for such person, in accordance with part 8 of this title, the PHA may establish a payment standard for the family of not more than 120 percent of the FMR.
