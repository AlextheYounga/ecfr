(1) The unit is eligible;

(2) The unit has been inspected by the PHA and passes HQS;

(3) The lease includes the tenancy addendum;

(4) The rent to owner is reasonable; and

(5) At the time a family initially receives tenant-based assistance for occupancy of a dwelling unit, and where the gross rent of the unit exceeds the applicable payment standard for the family, the family share does not exceed 40 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income.

(b) *Actions before lease term.* (1) All of the following must always be completed before the beginning of the initial term of the lease for a unit:

(i) The PHA has inspected the unit and has determined that the unit satisfies the HQS;

(ii) The landlord and the tenant have executed the lease (including the HUD-prescribed tenancy addendum, and the lead-based paint disclosure information as required in § 35.92(b) of this title); and

(iii) The PHA has approved leasing of the unit in accordance with program requirements.

(2)(i) The PHA must inspect the unit, determine whether the unit satisfies the HQS, and notify the family and owner of the determination:

(A) In the case of a PHA with up to 1250 budgeted units in its tenant-based program, within fifteen days after the family and the owner submit a request for approval of the tenancy.

(B) In the case of a PHA with more than 1250 budgeted units in its tenant-based program, within a reasonable time after the family submits a request for approval of the tenancy. To the extent practicable, such inspection and determination must be completed within fifteen days after the family and the owner submit a request for approval of the tenancy.

(ii) The fifteen day clock (under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B) of this section) is suspended during any period when the unit is not available for inspection.

(3) If the HAP contract is executed during the period of 60 calendar days from the beginning of the lease term, the PHA will pay housing assistance payments after execution of the HAP contract (in accordance with the terms of the HAP contract), to cover the portion of the lease term before execution of the HAP contract (a maximum of 60 days).

(4) Any HAP contract executed after the 60 day period is void, and the PHA may not pay any housing assistance payment to the owner.

(d) *Notice to family and owner.* After receiving the family's request for approval of the assisted tenancy, the PHA must promptly notify the family and owner whether the assisted tenancy is approved.
