##### § 902.68 Technical review of results of PHAS physical condition indicator. #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 30501, May 11, 2023.

(a) *Request for technical reviews.* This section describes the process for requesting and granting technical reviews of physical inspection results.

(1) For these reviews, the burden of proof is on the PHA to show that an error occurred.

(2) A request for technical review must be submitted in writing to the Real Estate Assessment Center, Attention: TAC—Technical Review, 550 12th Street, SW., Suite 100, Washington, DC 20410 and must be received by HUD no later than 30 days following the issuance of the applicable results to the PHA.

(b) *Technical review of results of physical inspection results.* (1) For each project inspected, the results of the physical inspection and a score for that project will be provided to the PHA. If the PHA believes that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) occurred in the inspection of an individual project, the PHA may request a technical review of the inspection results for that project. Material errors are the only grounds for technical review of physical inspection results.

(2) A PHA's request for a technical review must be accompanied by the PHA's evidence that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) has occurred. The documentation submitted by the PHA may be photographic evidence; written material from an objective source, such as a local fire marshal or building code official or a licensed or registered architect or professional engineer with the authority to sign and seal or “stamp” documents, thus taking the legal responsibility for them, or other similar evidence that is specific to the inspectable area and item being challenged. The evidence must be more than a disagreement with the inspector's observations, or the inspector's finding regarding the severity of the deficiency.

(3) A technical review of a project's physical inspection will not be conducted based on conditions that were corrected subsequent to the inspection, nor will a request for a technical review be considered if the request is based on a challenge to the inspector's findings as to the severity of the deficiency (*i.e.,* minor, major, or severe).

(4) Upon receipt of a PHA's request for technical review of a project's inspection results, the PHA's file will be reviewed, including any objectively verifiable evidence produced by the PHA. If HUD's review determines that an objectively verifiable and material error(s) has been documented, then one or a combination of the following actions may be taken by HUD:

(i) Undertake a new inspection;

(ii) Correct the physical inspection report;

(iii) Issue a corrected physical condition score; and

(iv) Issue a corrected PHAS score.

(5) In determining whether a new inspection of the project is warranted and a new PHAS score must be issued, the PHA's file will be reviewed, including any evidence submitted, to determine whether the evidence supports that there may have been a material contractor error in the inspection that results in a significant change from the project's original physical condition score and the PHAS designation assigned to the PHA (i.e., high performer, standard performer, substandard performer, or troubled performer). If HUD determines that a new inspection is warranted, and the new inspection results in a significant change from the original physical condition score, and from the PHA's PHAS score and PHAS designation, the PHA shall be issued a new PHAS score.

(6) Material errors are those that exhibit specific characteristics and meet specific thresholds. The three types of material errors are:

(i) *Building data error.* A building data error occurs if the inspection includes the wrong building or a building that was not owned by the PHA, including common or site areas that were not a part of the project. Incorrect building data that does not affect the score, such as the address, building name, year built, etc., would not be considered material, but will nonetheless be corrected upon notice to HUD.

(ii) *Unit count error.* A unit count error occurs if the total number of public housing units considered in scoring is incorrect. Since scoring uses total public housing units, HUD will examine instances where the participant can provide evidence that the total units used is incorrect.

(iii) *Nonexistent deficiency error.* A nonexistent deficiency error occurs if the inspection cites a deficiency that does not exist.

(7) HUD's decision on a request for technical review is final and may not be further appealed under the administrative process in § 902.69.
