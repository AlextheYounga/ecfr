##### § 902.21 Physical condition standards for public housing—decent, safe, and sanitary housing in good repair (DSS/GR). #####

(a) *General.* Public housing must be maintained in a manner that meets the physical condition standards set forth in this part in order to be considered DSS/GR (standards that constitute acceptable basic housing conditions). These standards address the major physical areas of public housing: Site, building exterior, building systems, dwelling units, and common areas (see paragraph (b) of this section). These standards also identify health and safety considerations (see paragraph (c) of this section). These standards address acceptable basic housing conditions, not the adornment, décor, or other cosmetic appearance of the housing.

(b) *Major inspectable areas.* (1) *Site.* The site includes the components and must meet the requirements of 24 CFR 5.703(a).

(2) *Building exterior.* The building exterior includes the components and must meet the standards stated in 24 CFR 5.703(b).

(3) *Building systems.* The building's systems include components such as domestic water, electrical system, elevators, emergency power, fire protection, heating/ventilation/air conditioning (HVAC), and sanitary system. Each building's systems must meet the standards of 24 CFR 5.703(c).

(4) *Dwelling units.* Each dwelling unit within a building must meet the standards of 24 CFR 5.703(d).

(5) *Common areas.* Each common area must meet the standards of 24 CFR 5.703(e).
