(c) *Exception to program operation.* (1) Upon approval by HUD, a PHA will not be required to establish and carry out a public housing or a Section 8 FSS program if the PHA provides to HUD a certification, as defined in ยง 984.103, that the establishment and operation of such an FSS program is not feasible because of local circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to:

(2) An exception will not be granted if HUD determines that local circumstances do not preclude the PHA from effectively operating an FSS program that is smaller than the minimum program size.

(d) *Reduction in program size.* Upon approval by HUD, a PHA may be permitted to operate a public housing or a Section 8 FSS program that is smaller than the minimum program size if the PHA provides to HUD a certification, as defined in ยง 984.103, that the operation of an FSS program of the minimum program size is not feasible because of local circumstances, which may include, but are not limited to:

(1) Decrease in or lack of accessible supportive services, including decrease in the availability of programs under JTPA or JOBS;

(2) Decrease in or lack of funding for reasonable administrative costs;

(3) Decrease in or lack of cooperation by other units of State or local government;

If a PHA seeks to continue an exception after its expiration, the PHA must submit a new request and a new certification to HUD for consideration.

(f) *Review of certification records.* HUD reserves the right to examine, during its management review of the PHA, or at any time, the documentation and data that a PHA relied on in certifying to the unfeasibility of its establishing and operating an FSS program, or of operating an FSS program of less than minimum program size.
