##### § 984.306 Section 8 residency and portability requirements. #####

(a) *Relocating FSS family.* For purposes of this section, the term “relocating FSS family” refers to an FSS family that moves from the jurisdiction of a PHA at least 12 months after signing its contract of participation.

(b) *Initial occupancy* - (1) *First 12 months.* A family participating in the Section 8 FSS program must lease an assisted unit, for a minimum period of 12 months after the effective date of the contract of participation, in the jurisdiction of the PHA that selected the family for the FSS program. However, the PHA may approve a family's request to move outside the initial PHA jurisdiction under portability (in accordance with § 982.353 of this chapter) during this period.

(2) *After the first 12 months.* After the first 12 months of the FSS contract of participation, the FSS family may move outside the initial PHA jurisdiction under portability procedures (in accordance with § 982.353 of this chapter).

(c) *Portability: relocation but continued participation in the FSS program of the* initial PHA - (1) *General.* A relocating FSS family may continue in the FSS program of the initial PHA if the family demonstrates to the satisfaction of the initial PHA that, notwithstanding the move, the relocating FSS family will be able to fulfill its responsibilities under the initial or modified contract of participation at its new place of residence. (For example, the FSS family may be able to commute to the supportive services specified in the contract of participation, or the family may move to obtain employment as specified in the contract.)

(2) *Single contract of participation.* If the relocating family remains in the FSS program of the initial PHA, there will only be one contract of participation, which shall be the contract executed by the initial PHA.

(d) *Portability: relocation and participation in the FSS program of the receiving PHA* - (1) *General.* A relocating FSS family may participate in the FSS program of the receiving PHA, if the receiving PHA allows the family to participate in its program. a PHA is not obligated to enroll a relocating FSS family in its FSS program.

(2) *Two contracts of participation.* If the receiving PHA allows the relocating FSS family to participate in its FSS program, the receiving PHA will enter into a new contract of participation with the FSS family for the term on the remaining contract with the initial PHA. The initial PHA will terminate its contract of participation with the family.

(e) *Single FSS account.* Regardless of whether the relocating FSS family remains in the FSS program of the initial PHA or is enrolled in the FSS program of the receiving PHA, there will be a single FSS account which will be maintained by the initial PHA. When an FSS family will be absorbed by the receiving PHA, the initial PHA will transfer the family's FSS account to the receiving PHA.

(f) *FSS program termination; loss of FSS account; and termination of Section 8 assistance.* (1) If an FSS family that relocates to another jurisdiction, as provided under this section, is unable to fulfill its obligations under the contract of participation, or any modifications thereto, the PHA, which is party to the contract of participation, may:

(i) Terminate the FSS family from the FSS program and the family's FSS account will be forfeited; and

(ii) Terminate the FSS family's Section 8 assistance on the ground that the family failed to meet its obligations under the contract of participation.

(2) In the event of forfeiture of the family's FSS account, the funds in the family's FSS account will revert to the PHA maintaining the FSS account for the family.
