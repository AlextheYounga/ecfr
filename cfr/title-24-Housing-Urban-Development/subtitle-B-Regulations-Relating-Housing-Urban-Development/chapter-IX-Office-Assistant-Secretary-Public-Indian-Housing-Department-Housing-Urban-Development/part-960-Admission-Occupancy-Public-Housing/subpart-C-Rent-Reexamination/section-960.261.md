##### § 960.261 Restriction on eviction of families based on income. #####

(a) PHAs may evict or terminate the tenancies of families who are over income, subject to paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) Unless it is required to do so by local law, a PHA may not evict or terminate the tenancy of a family solely because the family is over the income limit for public housing, if the family has a valid contract for participation in an FSS program under 24 part 984. A PHA may not evict a family for being over the income limit for public housing if the family currently receives the earned income disallowance provided by 42 U.S.C. 1437a(d) and 24 CFR 960.255.
