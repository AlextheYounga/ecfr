##### § 1006.301 Eligible families. #####

(a) Assistance for eligible housing activities under the Act and this part is limited to low-income Native Hawaiian families who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home Lands, except as provided under paragraphs (b) and (c), of this section.

(b) *Exception to low-income requirement*—(1) *Other Native Hawaiian families.* The DHHL may provide assistance for homeownership activities and through loan guarantee activities to Native Hawaiian families who are not low-income families, as approved by HUD, to address a need for housing for those families that cannot be reasonably met without that assistance.

(2) *Limitations.* HUD approval is required if the DHHL plans to use its annual grant amount for assistance in accordance with paragraph (b)(1), of this section.

(c) *Other families.* The DHHL may provide housing or NHHBG assistance to a family that is not low-income and is not composed of Native Hawaiians if the DHHL documents that:

(1) The presence of the family in the housing involved is essential to the well-being of Native Hawaiian families; and

(2) The need for housing for the family cannot be reasonably met without the assistance.

(d) *Written policies.* The DHHL must develop, follow, and have available for review by HUD written policies governing the eligibility, admission, and occupancy of families for housing assisted with NHHBG funds and governing the selection of families receiving other assistance under the Act and this part.
