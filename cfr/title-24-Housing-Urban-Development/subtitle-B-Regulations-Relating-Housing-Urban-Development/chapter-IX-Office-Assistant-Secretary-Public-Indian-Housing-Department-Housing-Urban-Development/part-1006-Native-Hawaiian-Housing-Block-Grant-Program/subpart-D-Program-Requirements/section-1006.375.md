(3) *Relocation assistance for displaced persons.* A displaced person (defined in paragraph (d)(7) of this section) must be provided relocation assistance at the levels described in, and in accordance with the requirements of, the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended (URA) (42 U.S.C. 4601-4655) and implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24.

(5) *Responsibility of DHHL.* (i) The DHHL shall certify that it will comply with the URA, the regulations at 49 CFR part 24, and the requirements of this section. The DHHL shall ensure such compliance notwithstanding any third party's contractual obligation to the DHHL to comply with the provisions in this section.

(iii) The DHHL shall maintain records in sufficient detail to demonstrate compliance with this section.

(6) *Definition of displaced person.* (i) For purposes of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under the Act. The term “displaced person” includes, but is not limited to:

(A) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after the submission to HUD of a housing plan that is later approved;

(B) Any person, including a person who moves before the date described in paragraph (d)(7)(i)(A) of this section, that the DHHL determines was displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for the assisted project;

(C) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling unit who moves from the building/complex permanently after execution of the agreement between the DHHL and HUD, if the move occurs before the tenant is provided written notice offering him or her the opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe and sanitary dwelling in the same building/complex, under reasonable terms and conditions, upon completion of the project. Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:

(*1*) The tenant-occupant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or

(*2*) 30 percent of gross household income.

(D) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who is required to relocate temporarily, but does not return to the building/complex, if either:

(*1*) The tenant-occupant is not offered payment for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the temporary relocation, including the cost of moving to and from the temporarily occupied unit, any increased housing costs and incidental expenses; or

(*2*) Other conditions of the temporary relocation are not reasonable.

(E) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:

(*1*) The tenant-occupant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or

(*2*) Other conditions of the move are not reasonable.

(ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(6)(i) of this section, a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:

(A) The person moved into the property after the submission of the housing plan to HUD, but before signing a lease or commencing occupancy, was provided written notice of the project, its possible impact on the person (e.g., the person may be displaced, temporarily relocated or suffer a rent increase) and the fact that the person would not qualify as a “displaced person” or for any assistance provided under this section as a result of the project;

(B) The person is ineligible under 49 CFR 24.2(g)(2); or

(C) The DHHL determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination.

(iii) The DHHL may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.

(7) *Definition of initiation of negotiations.* For purposes of determining the formula for computing the replacement housing assistance to be provided to a person displaced as a direct result of rehabilitation or demolition of the real property, the term “initiation of negotiations” means the execution of the agreement covering the rehabilitation or demolition (*See* 49 CFR part 24).

(d) *Audits.* The DHHL must comply with the requirements of the Single Audit Act and 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, with the audit report providing a schedule of expenditures for each grant. A copy of each audit must be submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse.
