The maximum monthly payment for a low-income family may not exceed 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income.

(c) *Exception for certain homeownership payments.* Homeownership payments for families who are not low-income, as permitted under ยง 1006.301(b), are not subject to the requirement that homebuyer payments may not exceed 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of that family.

(d) Low-income families who receive homeownership assistance other than lease-purchase assistance are not subject to the limitations in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
