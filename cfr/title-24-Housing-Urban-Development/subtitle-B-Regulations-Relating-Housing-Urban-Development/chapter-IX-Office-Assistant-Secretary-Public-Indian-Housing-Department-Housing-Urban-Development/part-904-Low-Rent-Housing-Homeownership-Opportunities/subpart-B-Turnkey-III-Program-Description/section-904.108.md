##### § 904.108 Break-even amount. #####

(a) *Definition.* The term “break-even amount” as used herein means the minimum average monthly amount required to provide funds for the items listed in the illustration below. A separate break-even amount shall be established for each size and type of dwelling unit, as well as for the Project as a whole. The break-even amount for EHPA and NRMR will vary by size and type of dwelling unit; similar variations as to other line items may be made if the LHA deems this equitable.

Illustration.The following is an illustration of the computation of the break-even amount based upon hypothetical amounts.

|                  (1) Operating Expense (see § 904.109):                  |     |      |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|------|
|                              Administration                              |$8.50|      |
|                            Homebuyer services                            |2.00 |      |
|                        Project supplied utilities                        |3.00 |      |
|                   Routine maintenance—common property                    |3.00 |      |
|                           Protective services                            |2.00 |      |
|                             General expense                              |6.50 |      |
|Nonroutine maintenance—common property (Contribution to operating reserve)|2.00 |$27.00|
|             (2) Earned Home Payments Account (see § 904.110)             |     |12.00 |
|            (3) Nonroutine Maintenance Reserve (see § 904.111)            |     | 7.50 |
|                            Break-Even Amount                             |     |46.50 |

The break-even amount does not include the monthly allowance for utilities which the homebuyer pays for directly, nor does it include any amount for debt service on the Project notes.

(b) *Excess over break-even.* When the homebuyer's required monthly payment (see § 904.107(j)) exceeds the applicable break-even amount, the excess shall constitute additional Project income and shall be deposited and used in the same manner as other Project income.

(c) *Deficit in monthly payment.* When the homebuyer's required monthly payment is less than the applicable break-even amount, the deficit shall be applied as a reduction of that portion of the monthly payment designated for operating expense (i. e., as a reduction of Project income). In all such cases, the EHPA and the NRMR shall be credited with the amount included in the break-even amount for these accounts.
