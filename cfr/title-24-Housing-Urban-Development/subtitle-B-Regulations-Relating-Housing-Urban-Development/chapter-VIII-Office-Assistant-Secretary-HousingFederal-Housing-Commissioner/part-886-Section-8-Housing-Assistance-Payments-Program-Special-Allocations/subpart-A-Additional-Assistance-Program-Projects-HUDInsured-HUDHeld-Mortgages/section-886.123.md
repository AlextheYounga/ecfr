##### § 886.123 Maintenance, operation and inspections. #####

(a) *Maintenance and operation.* The Owner shall maintain and operate the project so as to provide Decent, Safe, and Sanitary housing and he shall provide all the services, maintenance and utilities which he agrees to provide under the Contract, subject to abatement of housing assistance payments or other applicable remedies if he fails to meet these obligations.

(b) *Inspection prior to occupancy.* Prior to occupancy of any unit by a Family, the Owner and the Family shall inspect the unit and both shall certify, on forms prescribed by HUD that they have inspected the unit and have determined it to be Decent, Safe, and Sanitary in accordance with the criteria provided in the prescribed forms. Copies of these reports shall be kept on file by the Owner for at least three years.

(c) *Periodic inspections.* HUD will inspect or cause to be inspected a reasonable sample of contract units at least annually and at such other times as may be necessary to assure that the owner is meeting his contractual obligations. HUD will take into account complaints by occupants and any other information coming to its attention in scheduling inspections and shall notify the owner of its determination.

(d) *Units not Decent, Safe, and Sanitary.* If HUD notifies the Owner that he has failed to maintain a dwelling unit in Decent, Safe, and Sanitary condition and the Owner fails to take corrective action within the time prescribed in the notice, HUD may exercise any of its rights or remedies under the Contract, including abatement of housing assistance payments, even if the Family continues to occupy the unit.
