##### § 888.111 Fair market rents for existing housing: Applicability. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 80580, November 16, 2016.

(a) The fair market rents (FMRs) for existing housing are determined by HUD and are used in the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program (“voucher program”) (part 982 of this title), Section 8 project-based assistance programs and other programs requiring their use. In the voucher program, the FMRs are used to determine payment standard schedules. In the Section 8 project-based assistance programs, the FMRs are used to determine the maximum initial rent (at the beginning of the term of a housing assistance payments contract).

(b) Fair market rent means the rent, including the cost of utilities (except telephone), as established by HUD, pursuant to this subpart, for units of varying sizes (by number of bedrooms), that must be paid in the market area to rent privately owned, existing, decent, safe and sanitary rental housing of modest (non-luxury) nature with suitable amenities.
