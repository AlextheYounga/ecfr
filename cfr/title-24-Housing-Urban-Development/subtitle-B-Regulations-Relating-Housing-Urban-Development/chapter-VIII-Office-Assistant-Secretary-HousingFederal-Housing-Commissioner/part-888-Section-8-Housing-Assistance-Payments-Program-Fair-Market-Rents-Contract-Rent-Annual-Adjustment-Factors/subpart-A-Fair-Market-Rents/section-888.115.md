##### ยง 888.115 Fair market rents for existing housing: Manner of publication. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 80581, November 16, 2016.

FMRs will be published at least annually in the Federal Register. The Department will propose FMRs and provide a comment period of at least 30 days for the purpose of identifying areas where the FMRs are believed to be too high or too low. To be considered for FMR revisions, public comments must include statistically valid rental housing survey data that justify the requested changes. After the comments have been considered, the Department will publish a final notice announcing FMRs to be effective on October 1 each year.
