##### § 891.655 Definitions applicable to 202/162 projects. #####

The following definitions apply to projects for eligible families receiving project assistance payments under section 202(h) of the Housing Act of 1959 in addition to reservations under section 202 (202/162 projects):

*Annual income* is defined in part 813 of this chapter. In the case of an individual residing in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded that is assisted under Title XIX of the Social Security Act and subpart E of this part, the annual income of the individual shall exclude protected personal income as provided under that Act. For the purposes of determining the total tenant payment, the income of such individuals shall be imputed to be the amount that the family would receive if assisted under Title XVI of the Social Security Act.

*Assisted unit* means a dwelling unit that is eligible for assistance under a project assistance contract (PAC).

*Contract rent* means the total amount of rent specified in the PAC as payable by HUD and the family to the Borrower for an assisted unit or residential space.

*Family (eligible family)* means a handicapped family (as defined in § 891.505) that meets the project occupancy requirements approved by HUD and, if the family occupies an assisted unit, meets the low-income requirements described in § 813.102 of this chapter, as modified by the definition of “*annual income*” in this section.

*Gross rent* is defined in part 813 of this chapter.

*Group home* means a single family residential structure designed or adapted for occupancy by nonelderly handicapped individuals.

*Housing for handicapped families* means housing and related facilities occupied by handicapped families that are primarily nonelderly handicapped families.

*Independent living complex* means a project designed for occupancy by nonelderly handicapped families in separate dwelling units where each dwelling unit includes a kitchen and a bath.

*Operating costs* means expenses related to the provision of housing and excludes expenses related to administering, or managing the provision of, supportive services. Operating costs include:

(1) Administrative expenses, including salary and management expenses related to the provision of shelter;

(2) Maintenance expenses, including routine and minor repairs and groundskeeping;

(3) Security expenses;

(4) Utilities expenses, including gas, oil, electricity, water, sewer, trash removal, and extermination services. Operating costs exclude telephone services for families;

(5) Taxes and insurance; and

*PAC (project assistance contract)* means the contract entered into by the Borrower and HUD setting forth the rights and duties of the parties with respect to the project and the payments under the PAC.

*Project account* means a specifically identified and segregated account for each project which is established in accordance with § 891.715(b) out of the amounts by which the maximum annual commitment exceeds the amount actually paid out under the PAC each year.

*Project assistance payment* means the payment made by HUD to the Borrower for assisted units as provided in the PAC. The payment is the difference between the contract rent and the tenant rent. An additional payment is made to a family occupying an assisted unit in an independent living complex when the utility allowance is greater than the total tenant payment. A project assistance payment, known as a “vacancy payment,” may be made to the Borrower when an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) is vacant, in accordance with the terms of the PAC.

*Rent* is defined in § 891.505.

*Utility allowance* is defined in part 813 of this chapter and is determined or approved by HUD.

*Utility reimbursement* is defined in part 813 of this chapter.

*Vacancy payment* means the project assistance payment made to the Borrower by HUD for a vacant assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) if certain conditions are fulfilled, as provided in the PAC. The amount of the vacancy payment varies with the length of the vacancy period and is less after the first 60 days of any vacancy.
