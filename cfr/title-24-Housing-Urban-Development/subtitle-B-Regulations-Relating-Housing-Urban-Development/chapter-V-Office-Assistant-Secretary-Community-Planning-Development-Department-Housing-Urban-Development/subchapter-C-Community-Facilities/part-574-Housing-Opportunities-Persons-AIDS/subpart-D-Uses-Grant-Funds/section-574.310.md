All grantees using grant funds to provide housing must adhere to the following standards:

(a)(1) *General.* The grantee shall ensure that qualified service providers in the area make available appropriate supportive services to the individuals assisted with housing under this subpart. Supportive services are described in § 574.300(b)(7). For any individual with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or a related disease who requires more intensive care than can be provided in housing assisted under this subpart, the grantee shall provide for locating a care provider who can appropriately care for the individual and for referring the individual to the care provider.

(2) *Payments.* The grantee shall ensure that grant funds will not be used to make payments for health services for any item or service to the extent that payment has been made, or can reasonably be expected to be made, with respect to that item or service:

(i) Under any State compensation program, under an insurance policy, or under any Federal or State health benefits program; or

(ii) By an entity that provides health services on a prepaid basis.

(b) *Housing quality standards.* All housing assisted under § 574.300(b) (3), (4), (5), and (8) must meet the applicable housing quality standards outlined below.

(1) *State and local requirements.* Each recipient of assistance under this part must provide safe and sanitary housing that is in compliance with all applicable State and local housing codes, licensing requirements, and any other requirements in the jurisdiction in which the housing is located regarding the condition of the structure and the operation of the housing.

(2) *Habitability standards.* Except for such variations as are proposed by the locality and approved by HUD, recipients must meet the following requirements:

(i) *Structure and materials.* The structures must be structurally sound so as not to pose any threat to the health and safety of the occupants and so as to protect the residents from hazards.

(ii) *Access.* The housing must be accessible and capable of being utilized without unauthorized use of other private properties. Structures must provide alternate means of egress in case of fire.

(iii) *Space and security.* Each resident must be afforded adequate space and security for themselves and their belongings. An acceptable place to sleep must be provided for each resident.

(iv) *Interior air quality.* Every room or space must be provided with natural or mechanical ventilation. Structures must be free of pollutants in the air at levels that threaten the health of residents.

(v) *Water supply.* The water supply must be free from contamination at levels that threaten the health of individuals.

(vi) *Thermal environment.* The housing must have adequate heating and/or cooling facilities in proper operating condition.

(vii) *Illumination and electricity.* The housing must have adequate natural or artificial illumination to permit normal indoor activities and to support the health and safety of residents. Sufficient electrical sources must be provided to permit use of essential electrical appliance while assuring safety from fire.

(viii) *Food preparation and refuse disposal.* All food preparation areas must contain suitable space and equipment to store, prepare, and serve food in a sanitary manner.

(ix) *Sanitary condition.* The housing and any equipment must be maintained in sanitary condition.

(c) *Minimum use period for structures.* (1) Any building or structure assisted with amounts under this part must be maintained as a facility to provide housing or assistance for individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or related diseases:

(i) For a period of not less than 10 years, in the case of assistance provided under an activity eligible under § 574.300(b) (3) and (4) involving new construction, substantial rehabilitation or acquisition of a building or structure; or

(ii) For a period of not less than 3 years in the cases involving non-substantial rehabilitation or repair of a building or structure.

(2) Waiver of minimum use period. HUD may waive the minimum use period of a building or structure as stipulated in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the grantee can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of HUD, that:

(i) The assisted structure is no longer needed to provide supported housing or assistance, or the continued operation of the structure for such purposes is no longer feasible; and

(ii) The structure will be used to benefit individuals or families whose incomes do not exceed 80 percent of the median income for the area, as determined by HUD with adjustments for smaller and larger families, if the Secretary finds that such variations are necessary because of construction costs or unusually high or low family incomes.

(d) *Resident rent payment.* Except for persons in short-term supported housing, each person receiving rental assistance under this program or residing in any rental housing assisted under this program must pay as rent, including utilities, an amount which is the higher of:

(1) 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income (adjustment factors include the age of the individual, medical expenses, size of family and child care expenses and are described in detail in 24 CFR 5.609). The calculation of the family's monthly adjusted income must include the expense deductions provided in 24 CFR 5.611(a), and for eligible persons, the calculation of monthly adjusted income also must include the disallowance of earned income as provided in 24 CFR 5.617, if applicable;

(2) 10 percent of the family's monthly gross income; or

(3) If the family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency and a part of the payments, adjusted in accordance with the family's actual housing costs, is specifically designated by the agency to meet the family's housing costs, the portion of the payment that is designated for housing costs.

(e) *Termination of assistance*—(1) *Surviving family members.* With respect to the surviving member or members of a family who were living in a unit assisted under the HOPWA program with the person with AIDS at the time of his or her death, housing assistance and supportive services under the HOPWA program shall continue for a grace period following the death of the person with AIDS. The grantee or project sponsor shall establish a reasonable grace period for continued participation by a surviving family member, but that period may not exceed one year from the death of the family member with AIDS. The grantee or project sponsor shall notify the family of the duration of their grace period and may assist the family with information on other available housing programs and with moving expenses.

(2) *Violation of requirements*— (i) *Basis.* Assistance to participants who reside in housing programs assisted under this part may be terminated if the participant violates program requirements or conditions of occupancy, subject to the VAWA protections in 24 CFR 5.2005(b) and 24 CFR 5.2005(c). Grantees must ensure that supportive services are provided, so that a participant's assistance is terminated only in the most severe cases.

(ii) *Procedure.* In terminating assistance to any program participant for violation of requirements, grantees must provide a formal process that recognizes the rights of individuals receiving assistance to due process of law. This process at minimum, must consist of:

(A) Serving the participant with a written notice containing a clear statement of the reasons for termination;

(B) Permitting the participant to have a review of the decision, in which the participant is given the opportunity to confront opposing witnesses, present written objections, and be represented by their own counsel, before a person other than the person (or a subordinate of that person) who made or approved the termination decision; and

(C) Providing prompt written notification of the final decision to the participant.
