(a) *Definition.* A Federal, State or municipal governmental agency, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or the Federal National Mortgage Association may be an approved lender or mortgagee. A mortgagee approved under this section may submit applications for Title II mortgage insurance. A lender or mortgagee approved under this section may originate, purchase, service or sell Title I loans and insured mortgages, respectively. A mortgagee or lender approved under this section is not required to meet a net worth requirement. A mortgagee shall maintain fidelity bond coverage and errors and omissions insurance acceptable to the Secretary and in an amount required by the Secretary, or alternative insurance coverage approved by the Secretary, that assures the faithful performance of the responsibilities of the mortgagee. There are no additional requirements beyond the general approval requirements in § 202.5 or as provided under paragraph (b) of this section.

(b) *Public housing agencies and State housing agencies.* Under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe and notwithstanding the general requirements of § 202.5 or the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a public housing agency or its instrumentality or a State housing agency may be approved as a mortgagee for the purpose of originating and holding multifamily mortgages funded by issuance of tax exempt obligations by the agency.

(c) *Audit requirements.* The insuring of loans and mortgages under the Act constitutes “Federal financial assistance” (as defined in 2 CFR 200.40) for purposes of audit requirements set out in 2 CFR part 200, subpart F. Non-Federal entities (as defined in 2 CFR 200.69) that receive insurance as lenders and mortgagees shall conduct audits in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart F.
