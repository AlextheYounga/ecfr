(a) *Submission of bids.* All bids must be submitted to HUD in accordance with instructions in the bid package for a particular sale.

(b) *Effect of bid.* By submitting a bid, the bidder is making an offer to purchase single family mortgage loans as presented in the bid package. Submission of a bid constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions set forth in the bid package. Along with the bid, the bidder must submit an executed copy of the Loan Sale Agreement, which is included in the bid package.

(c) *Earnest money deposits.* The bidder must submit to HUD, along with its bid, an earnest money deposit in an amount to be determined by HUD. The earnest money deposit is nonrefundable to the winning bidder and will be credited toward the purchase price.

(d) *Termination of offering.* HUD reserves the right to terminate an offering in whole or in part at any time before the bid date.

(e) *Withdrawal of loans.* HUD reserves the right, in its sole discretion and for any reason whatsoever, to withdraw loan assets from a pool prior to the bid date. Any earnest money deposits relating to withdrawn loan assets will be retained by HUD and credited toward the total purchase price of the remaining loan assets in the pool, in accordance with the Loan Sale Agreement. After the bid date, HUD can withdraw mortgage loans in accordance with the Loan Sale Agreement.

(f) *Rejection of bids.* (1) HUD may, in its sole discretion, reject any bid under the following circumstances:

(i) If the bid does not conform with the instructions in the bid package; or

(ii) If, in HUD's sole discretion, it determines that such action would be in the best interests of the U.S. Government.
