All recipients shall cooperate fully and promptly with the Assistant Secretary in section 3 compliance reviews, in investigations of allegations of noncompliance made under ยง 135.76, and with the distribution and collection of data and information that the Assistant Secretary may require in connection with achieving the economic objectives of section 3.
