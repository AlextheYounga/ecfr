##### ยง 135.9 Requirements applicable to HUD NOFAs for section 3 covered programs. #####

(a) *Certification of compliance with part 135.* All notices of funding availability (NOFAs) issued by HUD that announce the availability of funding covered by section 3 shall include a provision in the NOFA that notifies applicants that section 3 and the regulations in part 135 are applicable to funding awards made under the NOFA. Additionally the NOFA shall require as an application submission requirement (which may be specified in the NOFA or application kit) a certification by the applicant that the applicant will comply with the regulations in part 135. (For PHAs, this requirement will be met where a PHA Resolution in Support of the Application is submitted.) With respect to application evaluation, HUD will accept an applicant's certification unless there is evidence substantially challenging the certification.

(b) *Statement of purpose in NOFAs.* (1) For competitively awarded assistance in which the grants are for activities administered by an HA, and those activities are anticipated to generate significant training, employment or contracting opportunities, the NOFA must include a statement that one of the purposes of the assistance is to give to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, job training, employment, contracting and other economic opportunities to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns.

(2) For competitively awarded assistance involving housing rehabilitation, construction or other public construction, where the amount awarded to the applicant may exceed $200,000, the NOFA must include a statement that one of the purposes of the assistance is to give, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State and local laws and regulations, job training, employment, contracting and other economic opportunities to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns.

(c) *Section 3 as NOFA evaluation criteria.* Where not otherwise precluded by statute, in the evaluation of applications for the award of assistance, consideration shall be given to the extent to which an applicant has demonstrated that it will train and employ section 3 residents and contract with section 3 business concerns for economic opportunities generated in connection with the assisted project or activity. The evaluation criteria to be utilized, and the rating points to be assigned, will be specified in the NOFA.
