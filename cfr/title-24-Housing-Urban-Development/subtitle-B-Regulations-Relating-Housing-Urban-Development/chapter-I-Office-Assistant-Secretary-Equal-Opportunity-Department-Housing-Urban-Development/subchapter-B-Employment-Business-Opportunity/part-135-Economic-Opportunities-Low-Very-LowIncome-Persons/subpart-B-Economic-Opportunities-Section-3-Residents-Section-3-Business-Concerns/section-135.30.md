##### § 135.30 Numerical goals for meeting the greatest extent feasible requirement. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Recipients and covered contractors may demonstrate compliance with the “greatest extent feasible” requirement of section 3 by meeting the numerical goals set forth in this section for providing training, employment, and contracting opportunities to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns.

(2) The goals established in this section apply to the entire amount of section 3 covered assistance awarded to a recipient in any Federal Fiscal Year (FY), commencing with the first FY following the effective date of this rule.

(3) For recipients that do not engage in training, or hiring, but award contracts to contractors that will engage in training, hiring, and subcontracting, recipients must ensure that, to the greatest extent feasible, contractors will provide training, employment, and contracting opportunities to section 3 residents and section 3 business concerns.

(4) The numerical goals established in this section represent minimum numerical targets.

(b) *Training and employment.* The numerical goals set forth in paragraph (b) of this section apply to new hires. The numerical goals reflect the aggregate hires. Efforts to employ section 3 residents, to the greatest extent feasible, should be made at all job levels.

(1) *Numerical goals for section 3 covered public and Indian housing programs.* Recipients of section 3 covered public and Indian housing assistance (as described in § 135.5) and their contractors and subcontractors may demonstrate compliance with this part by committing to employ section 3 residents as:

(2) *Numerical goals for other HUD programs covered by section 3.* (i) Recipients of section 3 covered housing assistance provided under other HUD programs, and their contractors and subcontractors (unless the contract or subcontract awards do not meet the threshold specified in § 135.3(a)(3)) may demonstrate compliance with this part by committing to employ section 3 residents as 10 percent of the aggregate number of new hires for each year over the duration of the section 3 project;

(ii) Where a managing general partner or management agent is affiliated, in a given metropolitan area, with recipients of section 3 covered housing assistance, for an aggregate of 500 or more units in any fiscal year, the managing partner or management agent may demonstrate compliance with this part by committing to employ section 3 residents as:

(A) 10 percent of the aggregate number of new hires for the one year period beginning in FY 1995;

(B) 20 percent of the aggregate number of new hires for the one year period beginning in FY 1996;

(C) 30 percent of the aggregate number of new hires for the one year period beginning in FY 1997, and continuing thereafter.

(i) 10 percent of the aggregate number of new hires for the one year period beginning in FY 1995;

(iii) 30 percent of the aggregate number of new hires for the one year period beginning in FY 1997 and continuing thereafter.

(c) *Contracts.* Numerical goals set forth in paragraph (c) of this section apply to contracts awarded in connection with all section 3 covered projects and section 3 covered activities. Each recipient and contractor and subcontractor (unless the contract or subcontract awards do not meet the threshold specified in § 135.3(a)(3)) may demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this part by committing to award to section 3 business concerns:

(1) At least 10 percent of the total dollar amount of all section 3 covered contracts for building trades work for maintenance, repair, modernization or development of public or Indian housing, or for building trades work arising in connection with housing rehabilitation, housing construction and other public construction; and

(2) At least three (3) percent of the total dollar amount of all other section 3 covered contracts.

(d) *Safe harbor and compliance determinations.* (1) In the absence of evidence to the contrary, a recipient that meets the minimum numerical goals set forth in this section will be considered to have complied with the section 3 preference requirements.

(2) In evaluating compliance under subpart D of this part, a recipient that has not met the numerical goals set forth in this section has the burden of demonstrating why it was not feasible to meet the numerical goals set forth in this section. Such justification may include impediments encountered despite actions taken. A recipient or contractor also can indicate other economic opportunities, such as those listed in § 135.40, which were provided in its efforts to comply with section 3 and the requirements of this part.
