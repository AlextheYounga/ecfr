##### ยง 2002.7 OIG processing of requests. #####

(a) *Multitracking.* (1) The Office of Inspector General places each request in one of two tracks. The Office of Inspector General places requests in its simple or complex track based on the amount of work and time involved in processing the request. Factors the Office of Inspector General will consider in assigning a request in the simple or complex track will include whether the request involves the processing of voluminous documents and/or whether the request involves responsive documents from more than one organizational unit. Within each track, the Office of Inspector General processes requests in the order in which they are received.

(2) For requests that have been sent to the wrong office, the Office of Inspector General will assign the request within each track using the earlier of either:

(i) The date on which the request was referred to the appropriate office; or,

(ii) The end of the ten (10) working day period in which the request should have been referred to the appropriate office.

(b) *Expedited processing.* The Office of Inspector General may take your request or appeal out of normal order if the Office of Inspector General determines that you have a compelling need for the records or in other cases as determined by the Office of Inspector General. If the Office of Inspector General grants your request for expedited processing, the Office of Inspector General will give your request priority and will process it as soon as practicable. The Office of Inspector General will consider a compelling need to exist if:

(1) Your failure to obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual or a threatened loss of substantial due process rights; or,

(2) You are primarily engaged in disseminating information and there is an urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
