##### ยง 2002.5 Records produced upon request when reasonably described. #####

(a) When a request is made which reasonably describes a record of the Office of Inspector General (see ยง 2002.3) which has been stored in the National Archives or other record center of the General Services Administration, the record will be requested by the Office of Inspector General if it otherwise would be available under this part.

(b) Every effort will be made to make a record in use by the staff of the Office of Inspector General available when requested, and such availability will be deferred only to the extent necessary to avoid serious interference with the business of the Office of Inspector General.
