##### § 3282.211 Record of purchasers. #####

(a) *Information requirements for purchasers.* (1) Every manufacturer of manufactured homes shall, for each manufactured home manufactured under the Federal standards, provide with the manufactured home a booklet containing at least 3 detachable cards as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. On the front of the booklet, in bold faced type, shall be printed the following language:

“Keep this booklet with your manufactured home. Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 provides you with protection against certain construction and safety hazards in your manufactured home. To help assure your protection, the manufacturer of your manufactured home needs the information which these cards, when completed and mailed, will supply. If you bought your home from a retailer, please be sure that your retailer has completed and mailed a card for you. If you acquired your home from someone who is not a retailer, you should promptly fill out and send a card to the manufacturer. It is important that you keep this booklet and give it to any person who buys the manufactured home from you.”

(2) The detachable cards shall contain blanks for the following information:

(i) Name and address of the retailer or other person selling the manufactured home to the purchaser;

(ii) Name and complete mailing address of the manufactured home purchaser;

(iii) Address where the manufactured home will be located, if not the same as item (a)(2)(ii) of this section.

(iv) Date of sale to the purchaser;

(v) Month, day and year of manufacture;

(vi) Identification number of the manufactured home;

(vii) Model and/or type designation of the manufactured home as provided by the manufacturer; and

(viii) A designation of the zones for which the manufactured home is equipped, as set forth in § 3280.305 in this title.

Additionally, the cards shall have the name and address of the manufacturer printed clearly on the reverse side and shall contain adequate postage or business reply privileges to ensure return to the manufacturer. The manufacturer shall have the responsibility for filing in the blanks on the cards for paragraphs (a)(2) (v), (vi), (vii), and (viii) of this section.

(3) The manufacturer shall maintain all cards received so that the manufacturer has a readily accessible record of the current purchaser or owner and the current address of all manufactured homes manufactured by it for which a card has been received.
