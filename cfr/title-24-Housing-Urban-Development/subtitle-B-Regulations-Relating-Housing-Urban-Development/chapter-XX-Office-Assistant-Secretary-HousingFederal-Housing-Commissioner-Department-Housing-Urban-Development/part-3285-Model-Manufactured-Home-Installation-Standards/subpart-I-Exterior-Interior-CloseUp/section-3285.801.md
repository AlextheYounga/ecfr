(c) Prior to installing the siding, the polyethylene sheeting covering exterior walls for transit must be completely removed.

(d) Prior to completing the exterior close-up, any holes in the roofing must be made weatherproof and sealed with a sealant or other material that is suitable for use with the roofing in which the hole is made.

(e) *Mate-line gasket.* The home manufacturer must provide materials and designs for mate-line gaskets or other methods designed to resist the entry of air, water, water vapor, insects, and rodents at all mate-line locations exposed to the exterior (see Figure B to this section).

(f) *Hinged roofs and eaves.* Hinged roofs and eaves must be completed during installation in compliance with all requirements of the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (24 CFR part 3280) and the Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282). Unless exempted by the following provisions, hinged roofs are also subject to a final inspection for compliance with the Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards (24 CFR part 3280) by the IPIA or a qualified independent inspector acceptable to the IPIA.
