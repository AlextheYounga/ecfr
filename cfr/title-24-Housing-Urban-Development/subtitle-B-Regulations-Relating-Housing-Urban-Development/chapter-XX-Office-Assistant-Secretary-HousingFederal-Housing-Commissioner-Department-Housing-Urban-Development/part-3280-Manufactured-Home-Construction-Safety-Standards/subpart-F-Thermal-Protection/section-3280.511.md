##### § 3280.511 Comfort cooling certificate and information. #####

(a) The manufactured home manufacturer shall permanently affix a “Comfort Cooling Certificate” to an interior surface of the home that is readily visible to the home owner. This certificate may be combined with the heating certificate required in § 3280.510. The manufacturer shall comply with one of the following three alternatives in providing the certificate and additional information concerning the cooling of the manufactured home:

(1) *Alternative I.* If a central air conditioning system is provided by the home manufacturer, the heat gain calculation necessary to properly size the air conditioning equipment shall be in accordance with procedures outlined in chapter 22 of the 1989 ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals, with an assumed location and orientation. The following shall be supplied in the Comfort Cooling Certificate:

Air Conditioner Manufacturer Air Conditioner Model

Certified Capacity \_\_\_\_\_\_ BTU/Hr. in accordance with the appropriate Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute Standards

The central air conditioning system provided with this home has been sized, assuming an orientation of the front (hitch) end of the home facing \_\_\_\_\_\_ and is designed on the basis of a 75 °F indoor temperature and an outdoor temperature of \_\_ °F dry bulb and \_\_ °F wet bulb.

Example Alternate I COMFORT COOLING CERTIFICATE Manufactured Home Mfg Plant Location Manufactured Home Model Air Conditioner Manufacturer

Certified Capacity \_\_\_\_\_\_ BTU/Hr. in accordance with the appropriate Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute Standards.

The central air conditioning system provided with this home has been sized assuming an orientation of the front (hitch end) of the home facing \_\_\_\_\_\_. On this basis, the system is designed to maintain an indoor temperature of 75 °F when outdoor temperatures are \_\_ °F dry bulb and \_\_ °F wet bulb.

The temperature to which this home can be cooled will change depending upon the amount of exposure of the windows to the sun's radiant heat. Therefore, the home's heat gains will vary dependent upon its orientation to the sun and any permanent shading provided. Information concerning the calculation of cooling loads at various locations, window exposures and shadings are provided in chapter 22 of the 1989 edition of the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals.

(2) *Alternative 2.* For each home suitable for a central air cooling system, the manufacturer shall provide the following statement: “This air distribution system of this home is suitable for the installation of a central air conditioning system.”

Example Alternate 2COMFORT COOLING CERTIFICATE Manufactured Home Manufacturer Plant Location Manufactured Home Model

This air distribution system of this home is suitable for the installation of central air conditioning.

The supply air distribution system installed in this home is sized for Manufactured Home Central Air Conditioning System of up to \_\_\_\_\_\_ B.T.U./Hr. rated capacity which are certified in accordance with the appropriate Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute Standards. When the air circulators of such air conditioners are rated at 0.3 inch water column static pressure or greater for the cooling air delivered to the manufactured home supply air duct system.

Information necessary to calculate cooling loads at various locations and orientations is provided in the special comfort cooling information provided with this manufactured home.

(3) *Alternative 3.* If the manufactured home is not equipped with an air supply duct system, or if the manufacturer elects not to designate the home as being suitable for the installation of a central air conditioning system, the manufacturer shall provide the following statement: “This air distribution system of this home has not been designed in anticipation of its use with a central air conditioning system.”

Example Alternate 3COMFORT COOLING CERTIFICATE Manufactured Home Mfg Plant Location Manufactured Home Model

The air distribution system of this home has not been designed in anticipation of its use with a central air conditioning system.

(b) For each home designated as suitable for central air conditioning the manufacturer shall provide the maximum central manufactured home air conditioning capacity certified in accordance with the ARI Standard 210/240-89 Unitary Air-Conditioning and Air-Source Heat Pump Equipment and in accordance with § 3280.715(a)(3). If the capacity information provided is based on entrances to the air supply duct at other than the furnace plenum, the manufacturer shall indicate the correct supply air entrance and return air exit locations.

(c) *Comfort cooling information.* For each manufactured home designated, either “suitable for” or “provided with” a central air conditioning system, the manufacturer shall provide comfort cooling information specific to the manufactured home necessary to complete the cooling load calculations. The comfort cooling information shall include a statement to read as follows:

To determine the required capacity of equipment to cool a home efficiently and economically, a cooling load (heat gain) calculation is required. The cooling load is dependent on the orientation, location and the structure of the home. Central air conditioners operate most efficiently and provide the greatest comfort when their capacity closely approximates the calculated cooling load. Each home's air conditioner should be sized in accordance with chapter 22 of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Handbook of Fundamentals, 1989 Edition, once the location and orientation are known.
