##### ยง 203.16a Mortgagor and mortgagee requirement for maintaining flood insurance coverage. #####

(a) If the mortgage is to cover property improvements (dwelling and related structures/equipment essential to the value of the property and subject to flood damage) that:

(1) Are located in an area designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a floodplain area having special flood hazards, or

(2) Are otherwise determined by the Commissioner to be subject to a flood hazard, and if flood insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is available with respect to these property improvements, the mortgagor and mortgagee shall be obligated, by a special condition to be included in the mortgage commitment, to obtain and to maintain NFIP flood insurance coverage on the property improvements during such time as the mortgage is insured.

(b) No mortgage may be insured that covers property improvements located in an area that has been identified by FEMA as an area having special flood hazards, unless the community in which the area is situated is participating in the National Flood Insurance Program and such insurance is obtained by the mortgagor. Such requirement for flood insurance shall be effective one year after the date of notification by FEMA to the chief executive officer of a flood prone community that such community has been identified as having special flood hazards.

(c) The flood insurance must be maintained during such time as the mortgage is insured in an amount at least equal to either the outstanding balance of the mortgage, less estimated land costs, or the maximum amount of the NFIP insurance available with respect to the property improvements, whichever is less.
