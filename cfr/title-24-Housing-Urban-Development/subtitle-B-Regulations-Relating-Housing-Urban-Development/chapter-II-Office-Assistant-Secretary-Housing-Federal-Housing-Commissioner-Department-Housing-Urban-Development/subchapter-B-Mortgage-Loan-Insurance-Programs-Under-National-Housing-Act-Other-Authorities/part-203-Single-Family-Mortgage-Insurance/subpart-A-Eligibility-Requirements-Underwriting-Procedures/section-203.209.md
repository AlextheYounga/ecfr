##### ยง 203.209 Payments under a plan. #####

(a) If a Plan issuer or insurance backer elects to compensate a homeowner for damage suffered by the homeowner's property that is covered under a Plan in lieu of the Plan issuer's making repairs such compensation must be made jointly to the mortgagee and the homeowner.

(b) If payment is to be made to the mortgagee and homeowner, the Plan issuer first must receive the mortgagee's assurance in witing that the mortgagee is satisfied, based on a showing by the homeowner, that the homeowner has made a binding commitment to have the necessary repairs made to restore the damaged property. It a homeowner elects not to repair his or her damaged property, then the mortgagee must apply the compensation in reduction of the outstanding indebtedness of the mortgage.
