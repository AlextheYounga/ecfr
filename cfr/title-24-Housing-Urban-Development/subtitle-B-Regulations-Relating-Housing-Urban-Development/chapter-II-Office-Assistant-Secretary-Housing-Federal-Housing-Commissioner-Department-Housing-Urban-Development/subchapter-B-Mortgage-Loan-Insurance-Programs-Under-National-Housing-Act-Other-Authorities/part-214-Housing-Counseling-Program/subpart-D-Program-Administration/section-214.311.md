Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 90658, December 14, 2016.

(a) *HUD funding.* HUD approval or program participation does not guarantee funding from HUD. Funding for the Housing Counseling program depends on appropriations from Congress and are awarded competitively under federal and HUD regulations and policies governing assistance programs, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 (42 U.S.C. 3545 *et seq.*). If funds become available that are to be competitively awarded, HUD will notify the public through a Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) in the Federal Register and via the Internet or other electronic media.

(b) *Local funding sources.* HUD recommends that approved agencies seek and secure funding from funding sources that may include local and state governments, private foundations, and lending or real estate organizations. Agencies must assure that such arrangements do not violate the provisions regarding conflicts of interest described in ยง 214.303(e).
