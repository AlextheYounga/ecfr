##### ยง 206.7 Effect of amendments. #####

The regulations in this part may be amended by the Secretary at any time and from time to time, in whole or in part, but amendments to subparts B and C of this part will not adversely affect the interests of a mortgagee on any mortgage to be insured for which either the Direct Endorsement mortgagee or Lender Insurance mortgagee has approved the mortgagor and all terms and conditions of the mortgage, or the Secretary has made a commitment to insure. Such amendments will not adversely affect the interests of a mortgagor in the case of a default by a mortgagee where the Secretary makes payments to the mortgagor.
