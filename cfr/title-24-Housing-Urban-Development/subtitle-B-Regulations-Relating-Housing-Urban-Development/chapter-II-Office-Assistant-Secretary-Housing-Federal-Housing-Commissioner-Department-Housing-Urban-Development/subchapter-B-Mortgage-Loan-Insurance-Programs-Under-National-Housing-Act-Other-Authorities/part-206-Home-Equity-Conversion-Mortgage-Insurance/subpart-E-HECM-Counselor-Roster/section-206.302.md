##### ยง 206.302 Establishment of the HECM Counselor Roster. #####

(a) *HECM Counselor Roster.* HUD maintains a Roster of HECM counselors. Only counselors listed on the Roster are approved to provide HECM counseling. A homeowner applying for an HECM loan to be insured by HUD must receive the required HECM counseling from one of the counselors on the Roster.

(b) *Disclaimer.* The inclusion of a HECM counselor on the Roster does not create or imply a warranty or endorsement by HUD of the listed counselor to a prospective HECM borrower or to any other organization or individual, nor does it represent a warranty of any counseling provided by the listed HECM counselor. The inclusion of a counselor on the Roster means that a listed counselor has met the HUD-prescribed qualifications and conditions for inclusion on the Roster and that the counselor is approved to provide HECM counseling by telephone or face-to-face.
