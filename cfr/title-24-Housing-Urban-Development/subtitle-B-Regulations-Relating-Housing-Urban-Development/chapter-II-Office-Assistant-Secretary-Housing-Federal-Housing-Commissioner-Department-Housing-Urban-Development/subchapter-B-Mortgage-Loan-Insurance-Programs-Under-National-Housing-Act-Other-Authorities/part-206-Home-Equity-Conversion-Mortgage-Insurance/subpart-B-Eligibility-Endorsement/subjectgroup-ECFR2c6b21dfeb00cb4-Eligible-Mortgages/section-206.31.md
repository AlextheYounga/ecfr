(a) *Fees at closing.* The mortgagee may collect, either in cash at the time of closing or through an initial payment under the mortgage, the following charges and fees incurred in connection with the origination of the mortgage loan:

(1) A charge to compensate the mortgagee for expenses incurred in originating and closing the mortgage loan, which may be fully financed with the mortgage.

The mortgagor is not permitted to pay any additional origination fee of any kind to a mortgage broker or sponsored third-party originator. A mortgage broker's fee can be included as part of the origination fee only if the mortgage broker is engaged independently by the homeowner and there is no financial interest between the mortgage broker and the mortgagee.

(2) Reasonable and customary amounts, but not more than the amount actually paid by the mortgagee, for any of the following items:

(i) Recording fees and recording taxes, or other charges incident to the recordation of the insured mortgage;

(ii) Credit report;

(iii) Survey, if required by the mortgagee or the mortgagor;

(iv) Title examination;

(v) Mortgagee's title insurance;

(vi) Fees paid to an appraiser for the initial appraisal of the property; and

(vii) Such other charges as may be authorized by the Secretary.

(b) *Repair administration fee.* If the property requires repairs after closing in order to meet HUD requirements, the mortgagee may collect a fee as compensation for administrative duties relating to repair work pursuant to ยง 206.47(c), not to exceed the greater of one and one-half percent of the amount advanced for the repairs or fifty dollars. The mortgagee shall collect the repair fee by adding it to the mortgage balance.
