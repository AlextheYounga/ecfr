##### § 206.19 Payment options. #####

(a) *Term payment option.* Under the term payment option, equal monthly payments are made by the mortgagee to the mortgagor for a fixed term of months chosen by the mortgagor, unless the mortgage is prepaid in full or becomes due and payable earlier under § 206.27(c).

(b) *Tenure payment option.* Under the tenure payment option, equal monthly payments are made by the mortgagee to the mortgagor as long as the property is the principal residence of the mortgagor, unless the mortgage is prepaid in full or becomes due and payable under § 206.27(c).

(c) *Line of credit payment option.* Under the line of credit payment option, payments are made by the mortgagee to the mortgagor at times and in amounts determined by the mortgagor as long as the amounts do not exceed the payment amounts permitted by § 206.25(d).

(d) *Principal limit set asides.* (1) Under the term or tenure options, the mortgagee shall, if requested by the mortgagor, set aside a portion of the principal limit to be drawn down as a line of credit.

(2) When repairs required by § 206.47 will be completed after closing, the mortgagee shall set aside a portion of the principal limit equal to 150% of the Secretary's estimated cost of repairs, plus the repair administration fee.

(3) When required by § 206.205(f), the mortgagee shall set aside a portion of the principal limit for payment of property charges consisting of taxes, ground rents, flood and hazard insurance premiums and assessments.

(4) When servicing charges will be made as permitted by § 206.207(b), the mortgagee shall set aside a portion of the principal limit sufficient to cover charges through a period equal to the payment term which would be used to calculate tenure payments under § 206.25(c).

(e) *Interest accrual and repayment.* The interest charged on the mortgage balance shall be added to the mortgage balance monthly as provided in the mortgage. Under all payment options, repayment of the mortgage balance including monthly MIP and interest is deferred until the mortgage becomes due and payable in full under § 206.27(c).

(f) *Payments limited by lien amount.* No payments shall be made under any of the payment options, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section or in § 206.25, in an amount which shall cause the mortgage balance after the payment to exceed any maximum mortgage amount stated in the security instruments or to otherwise exceed the amount secured by a first lien.
