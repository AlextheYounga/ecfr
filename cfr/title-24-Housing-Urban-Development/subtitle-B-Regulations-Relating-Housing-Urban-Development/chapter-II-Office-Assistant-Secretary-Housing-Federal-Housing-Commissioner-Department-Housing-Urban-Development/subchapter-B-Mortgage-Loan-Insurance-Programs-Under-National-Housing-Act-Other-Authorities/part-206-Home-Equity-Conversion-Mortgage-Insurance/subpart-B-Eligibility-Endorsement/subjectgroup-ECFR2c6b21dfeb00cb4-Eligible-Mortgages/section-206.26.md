##### § 206.26 Change in payment option. #####

(a) *General.* The payment option may be changed as provided in this section.

(b) *Change due to initial repairs.* (1) If initial repairs after closing under § 206.47 are completed without using all of the funds set aside for repairs, the mortgagee shall transfer the remaining amount to a line of credit and inform the mortgagor of the sum available to be drawn.

(2) If repairs after closing under § 206.47 cannot be completed with the funds set aside for repairs, the mortgagee may advance additional funds to complete repairs from an existing line of credit. If a line of credit is not sufficient to make the advance or if no line of credit exists, future monthly payments shall be recalculated for use as a line of credit in accordance with § 206.25.

(3) If repairs are not completed when required by the mortgage, the mortgagee shall stop monthly payments and the mortgage shall convert to the line of credit payment option. Until the repairs are completed, the mortgagee shall make no line of credit payments except as needed to pay for repairs required by the mortgage.

(c) *Other changes.* As long as the mortgage balance is less than the principal limit, a mortgagor may request a change from any payment option to another or a payment of any amount (not to exceed the difference between the principal limit and the sum of the mortgage balance and any set asides for repairs or servicing charges). A mortgage will continue to bear interest at a fixed or adjustable interest rate as agreed between the mortgagee and the mortgagor at loan origination. The mortgagee shall recalculate any future monthly payments in accordance with § 206.25.

(d) *Fee for change in payment.* The mortgagee may charge a fee, not to exceed an amount determined by the Secretary, whenever payments are recalculated.

(e) *Limitations.* The Secretary may prescribe a limitation on the frequency of payment changes, a minimum notice period that a mortgagor must provide with a request under paragraph (c) of this section, or other limitations on changes by the mortgagor.
