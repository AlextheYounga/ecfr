##### § 206.35 Title held by mortgagor. #####

The mortgagor shall hold title to the entire property which is the security for the mortgage. If there are multiple mortgagors, all the mortgagors must collectively hold title to the entire property which is the security for the mortgage. If one or more mortgagors hold a life estate in the property, for purposes of this section only the term “mortgagor” shall include each holder of a future interest in the property (remainder or reversion) who has executed the mortgage.
