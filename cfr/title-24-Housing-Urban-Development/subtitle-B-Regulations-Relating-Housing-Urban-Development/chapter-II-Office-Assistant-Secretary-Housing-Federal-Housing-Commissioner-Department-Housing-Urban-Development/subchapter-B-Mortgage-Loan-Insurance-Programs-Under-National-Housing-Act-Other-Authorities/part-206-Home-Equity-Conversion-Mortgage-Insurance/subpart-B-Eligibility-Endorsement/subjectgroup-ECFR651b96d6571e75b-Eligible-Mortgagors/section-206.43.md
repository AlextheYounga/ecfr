##### § 206.43 Information to mortgagor. #####

(a) *Disclosure of costs of obtaining mortgage.* The mortgagee must ensure that the mortgagor has received full disclosure of all costs of obtaining the mortgage. The mortgagee must ask the mortgagor about any costs or other obligations that the mortgagor has incurred to obtain the mortgage, as defined by the Secretary, in addition to providing the Good Faith Estimate required by § 3500.7 of this title. The mortgagee must clearly state to the mortgagor which charges are required to obtain the mortgage and which are not required to obtain the mortgage.

(b) *Lump sum disbursement.* (1) If the mortgagor requests that at least 25% of the principal limit amount (after deducting amounts excluded in the following sentence) be disbursed at closing to the mortgagor (or as otherwise permitted by § 206.29), the mortgagee must make sufficient inquiry at closing to confirm that the mortgagor will not use any part of the amount disbursed for payments to or on behalf of an estate planning service firm, with an explanation of § 206.32 as necessary or appropriate.

(2) This paragraph does not apply to any part of the principal limit used for the following:

(i) Initial MIP under § 206.105(a) or fees and charges allowed under § 206.31(a) paid by the mortgagee from mortgage proceeds instead of by the mortgagor in cash; and

(ii) Amounts set aside under § 206.47 for repairs, under § 206.205(f) for property charges, or § 206.207(b).
