##### § 206.129 Payment of claim. #####

(a) *General.* If the claim for the payment of the insurance benefits is acceptable to the Secretary, payment shall be made in cash in the amount determined under this section.

(b) *Limit on claim amount.* In no case may the claim paid under this subpart exceed the maximum claim amount. The interest allowance provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(iii), (e)(2) and (f)(2) of this section shall not be included in determining the limit on the claim amount.

(c) *Shared appreciation mortgages.* The terms *mortgage balance* and *accrued interest* as used in this section do not include interest attributable to the mortgagee's share of the appreciated value of the property.

(d) *Amount of payment - mortgagee acquires title or is unsuccessful bidder.* This paragraph describes the amount of payment if the mortgagee acquires title by purchase, foreclosure, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, or when a party other than the mortgagee is the successful bidder at the foreclosure sale.

(1) The amount of the claim shall be computed by (i) totalling the mortgage balance, (including any accrued interest and MIP which have been added to the mortgage balance) and any accrued interest which has not been added to the mortgage balance as of the due date (defined in the following sentence), and allowances for items set forth in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and (ii) subtracting from that total the amount for which the property was sold (or the appraised value determined under § 206.127(a)) and the items set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. *Due date* means the date when the mortgagee notifies the Secretary under § 206.27(c)(1) that the mortgage became due and payable, or, if applicable, the date the Secretary granted approval under § 206.27(c)(2) for the mortgage to become due and payable.

(2) The claim shall include the following items:

(i) Items listed in § 203.402 (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (g), (j), and (s), and § 204.322(l) of this chapter.

(ii) Foreclosure costs or costs of acquiring the property actually paid by the mortgagee and approved by HUD, in an amount not in excess of two-thirds of such costs or $75, whichever is the greater. For mortgages insured after March 1, 1997, HUD may reimburse a percentage of foreclosure costs or costs of acquiring the property, which percentage shall be determined in accordance with such conditions as HUD shall prescribe.

(iii) An amount equal to the interest allowance which would have been earned, from the due date to the date when payment of the claim is made, if the claim had been paid in debentures, except that when the mortgagee fails to meet any one of the applicable requirements of §§ 206.125 and 206.127 of this subpart within the specified time, and in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary (or within such further time as the Secretary may approve in writing), the interest allowance in such cash payment shall be computed only to the date on which the particular required action should have been taken or to which it was extended. The provisions of §§ 203.405 through 203.411 of this chapter pertaining to debentures are incorporated by reference.

(iv) Costs of any appraisal obtained under §§ 206.125 or 206.127, provided that the appraisal was obtained after the mortgage became due and payable and that the mortgagee is not otherwise reimbursed for such costs.

(v) Reasonable payments made by the mortgagee for:

(A) Preservation and maintenance of the property;

(B) Repairs necessary to meet the objectives of the property standards required for mortgages insured by the Secretary, those required by local law, and such additional repairs as may be specifically approved in advance by the Commissioner; and

(C) Expenses in connection with the sale of the property including a sales commission at the rate customarily paid in the community and, if the sale to the buyer involves a mortgage insured by the Secretary or guaranteed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, a discount at a rate not to exceed the maximum allowable by the Commissioner, as of the date of execution of the discounted loan, on sales of properties acquired by the Commissioner pursuant to §§ 203.295 through 203.426 of this chapter.

(e) *Amount of payment - assigned mortgages.* This paragraph describes the amount of payment if the mortgagee assigns a mortgage to the Secretary under § 206.107(a)(1) or § 206.121(b).

(1) When a mortgagee assigns a mortgage which is eligible for assignment under § 206.107(a)(1), the amount of payment shall be computed by subtracting from the mortgage balance on the date of assignment the items set forth in § 203.404(b) of this chapter and any adjustments for damage or neglect to the property pursuant to §§ 203.377, 203.378 and 203.379 of this chapter.

(2) The claim shall also include:

(i) Reimbursement for such costs and attorney's fees as the Secretary finds were properly incurred in connection with the assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary, and

(ii) An amount equivalent to the interest allowance which will have been earned from the date the mortgage was assigned to the Secretary to the date the claim is paid, if the claim had been paid in debentures, except that if the mortgagee fails to meet any of the requirements of § 206.127(c), or § 206.131 if applicable, within the specified time and in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary (or within such further time as the secretary may approve in writing), the interest allowance in the payment of the claim shall be computed only to the date on which the particular required action should have been taken or to which it was extended. The provisions of §§ 203.405 through 203.411 of this chapter pertaining to debentures are incorporated by reference.

(3) When a mortgagee assigns a mortgage under § 206.121(b) after demand by the Secretary, the mortgagee will not receive the entire claim payment as contained in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section. The amount of the claim shall be computed by (i) totalling the payments made by the mortgagee to the mortgagor or for the benefit of the mortgagor (including MIP), and subtracting from the total (ii) the items set forth in § 203.404(b) of this chapter and any adjustments for damage or neglect to the property pursuant to §§ 203.378 and 203.379 of this chapter. The claim shall also be reduced by an amount determined by the Secretary to reimburse the Secretary for administrative expenses incurred in assuming the mortgagee's responsibility under the mortgage, which may include expenses for staff time. If more than one mortgage is assigned to the Secretary, the administrative expenses incurred for all the mortgages assigned shall be allocated among the mortgages as determined by the Secretary. The claim shall not include accrued interest whether or not it has been included in the mortgage balance.

(f) *Amount of payment-mortgagor sells the property.* This paragraph describes the amount of payment if the mortgagor sells the property to one other than the mortgagee for less than the mortgage balance, and the mortgagee releases the mortgage to facilitate the sale.

(1) The amount of the claim shall be computed by (i) totalling the mortgage balance (including any accrued interest and MIP which have been added to the mortgage balance) and any accrued interest which has not been added to the mortgage balance on the date the deed is recorded, and allowances for items set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (iv) of this section as applicable, and subtracting from the total (ii) the net proceeds of the sale paid to the mortgagee and the items set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

(2) The claim shall also include an amount equivalent to the interest allowance which would have been earned from the date the deed is recorded to the date when payment of the claim is made, if the claim had been paid in debentures, except that when the mortgagee fails to meet any of the applicable requirements of §§ 206.125 and 206.127 of this subpart within the specified time (or within such further time as the Secretary may approve in writing), and in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary, the interest allowance in such cash payment shall be computed only to the date on which the particular action should have been taken or to which it was extended. The provisions of §§ 203.405 through 203.411 of this chapter pertaining to debentures are incorporated by reference.
