##### ยง 200.170 FHA Inspector Roster; Mortgagee and inspector requirements. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 31042, July 3, 2018.

(a) *General.* The FHA Inspector Roster (Roster) is a list of the inspectors selected by FHA as eligible to determine if the construction quality of a one- to four-unit property is acceptable as security for an FHA insured loan.

(b) *Mortgagee requirement.* Only an inspector included on the Roster may be selected by a mortgagee to determine if the construction quality of a property is acceptable as security for an FHA insured loan, as follows:

(1) For new construction, the FHA requires three inspections by Roster inspectors; and

(2) For existing construction, the FHA requires an inspection by a Roster inspector where structural repairs have been made requiring an inspection and this inspection is not performed by a licensed, bonded, and registered engineer; a licensed home inspector; or other person specifically registered or licensed to conduct such inspections.

(3) The requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply if:

(i) The local jurisdiction where the newly constructed one- to four-unit property is located performs the inspections and issues a building permit prior to construction and a certificate of occupancy or equivalent document; or

(ii) When the new construction is 100 percent complete, an appraiser who is on FHA's Appraiser Roster appraises the property and an FHA Roster inspector has already performed two inspections.

(c) *Inspector requirement.* To be eligible to conduct inspections as required by paragraph (b) of this section, an inspector must be listed on the Roster, except that any inspector already otherwise listed by HUD as eligible to conduct inspections as of April 9, 2004, may conduct inspections until October 12, 2004, without being listed on the Roster.

(d) *Effect of placement on the Roster.* Placement of an inspector on the Roster only qualifies an inspector to be selected by a mortgagee to determine if the construction quality of a property is acceptable as security for an FHA-insured loan. Placement on the Roster does not guarantee that any mortgagee will select an inspector. Use of an inspector placed on the Roster also does not create or imply any warranty or endorsement concerning the inspected property by HUD to a prospective homebuyer or any other party.
