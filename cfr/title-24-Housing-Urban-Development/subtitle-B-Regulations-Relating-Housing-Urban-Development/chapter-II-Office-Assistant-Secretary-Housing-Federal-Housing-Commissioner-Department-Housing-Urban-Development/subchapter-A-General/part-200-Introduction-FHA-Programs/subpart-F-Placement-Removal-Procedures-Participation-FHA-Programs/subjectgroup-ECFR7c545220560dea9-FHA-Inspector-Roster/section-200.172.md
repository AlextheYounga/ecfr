##### ยง 200.172 Removal from the Inspector Roster. #####

(a) *Cause for removal.* HUD may remove an inspector from the Roster for any cause that HUD determines to be detrimental to HUD or its programs. Cause for removal includes, but is not limited to:

(1) Poor performance on a HUD quality control field review;

(2) Failure to comply with applicable regulations or other written instructions or standards issued by HUD;

(3) Failure to comply with applicable civil rights requirements;

(4) Being debarred, suspended, or subject to a limited denial of participation;

(5) Misrepresentation or fraudulent statements;

(6) Failure to retain standing as a state or local government licensed or certified inspector, where such a license or certificate is required;

(7) Failure to respond within a reasonable time to HUD inquiries or requests for documentation; or

(8) Being listed on HUD's Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS).

(b) *Procedure for removal.* An inspector that is debarred, suspended, or subject to a limited denial of participation will be automatically removed from the Roster. In all other cases, the following procedure for removal will be followed:

(1) HUD will give the inspector written notice of the proposed removal. The notice will state the reasons for and the duration of the proposed removal.

(2) The inspector will have 20 days after the date of the notice (or longer, if provided in the notice) to submit a written response appealing the proposed removal and requesting a conference. A request for a conference must be in writing and must be submitted with the written response.

(3) A HUD official will review the appeal and send a response either affirming, modifying, or canceling the removal. The HUD official will not be someone who was involved in HUD's initial removal decision. HUD will respond with a decision within 30 days after receiving the appeal or, if the inspector has requested a conference, within 30 days after the completion of the conference. HUD may extend the 30-day period by providing written notice to the inspector.

(4) If the inspector does not submit a timely written response, the removal will be effective 20 days after the date of HUD's initial removal notice (or after a longer period provided in the notice). If a written response is submitted, and the removal decision is affirmed or modified, the removal will be effective on the date of HUD's notice affirming or modifying the initial removal decision.

(c) *Placement on the list after removal.* An inspector who has been removed from the Roster may apply for placement on the Roster (in accordance with ยง 200.171) after the period of the inspector's removal from the Roster has expired. An application will be rejected if the period for the inspector's removal from the list has not expired.

(d) *Other action.* Nothing in this section prohibits HUD from taking such other action against an inspector, as provided in 2 CFR part 2424, or from seeking any other remedy against an inspector, available to HUD by statute or otherwise.
