HUD will provide information on the eligibility of bidders in the bid package, a notice in the Federal Register, or other means, at the Secretary's full discretion. However, an individual, partnership, corporation, or other legal entity will not be eligible to bid for any loan pool, either as an individual or a participant, if, at the time of the sale, that individual or entity is debarred or suspended from doing business with HUD under 2 CFR part 2424.
