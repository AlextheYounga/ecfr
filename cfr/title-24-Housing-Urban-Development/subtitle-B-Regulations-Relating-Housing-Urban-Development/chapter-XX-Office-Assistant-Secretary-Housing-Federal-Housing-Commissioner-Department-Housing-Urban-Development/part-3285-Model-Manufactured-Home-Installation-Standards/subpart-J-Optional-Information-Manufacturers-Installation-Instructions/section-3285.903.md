It is recommended that the installation instructions include the following information related to permits, alterations, and on-site structures:

(a) *Issuance of permits.* All necessary LAHJ fees should be paid and permits should be obtained, which may include verification that LAHJ requirements regarding encroachments in streets, yards, and courts are obeyed and that permissible setback and fire separation distances from property lines and public roads are met.

(b) *Alterations.* Prior to making any alteration to a home or its installation, contact the LAHJ to determine if plan approval and permits are required.

(c) *Installation of on-site structures.* Each accessory building and structure is designed to support all of its own live and dead loads, unless the structure, including any attached garage, carport, deck, and porch, is to be attached to the manufactured home and is otherwise included in the installation instructions or designed by a registered professional engineer or registered architect.
