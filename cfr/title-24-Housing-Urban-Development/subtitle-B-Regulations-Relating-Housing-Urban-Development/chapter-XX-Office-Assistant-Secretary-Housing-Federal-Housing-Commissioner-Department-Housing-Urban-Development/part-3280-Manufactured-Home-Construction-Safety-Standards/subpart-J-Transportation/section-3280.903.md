##### § 3280.903 General requirements for designing the structure to withstand transportation shock and vibration. #####

(a) The cumulative effect of highway transportation shock and vibration upon a manufactured home structure may result in incremental degradation of its designed performance in terms of providing a safe, healthy and durable dwelling. Therefore, the manufactured home shall be designed, in terms of its structural, plumbing, mechanical and electrical systems, to fully withstand such transportation forces during its intended life. (See §§ 3280.303(c) and 3280.305(a)).

(b) Particular attention shall be given to maintaining watertight integrity and conserving energy by assuring that structural components in the roof and walls (and their interfaces with vents, windows, doors, etc.) are capable of resisting highway shock and vibration forces during primary and subsequent secondary transportation moves.

(c) In place of an engineering analysis, either of the following may be accepted:

(1) Documented technical data of suitable highway tests which were conducted to simulate transportation loads and conditions; or

(2) Acceptable documented evidence of actual transportation experience which meets the intent of this subpart.
