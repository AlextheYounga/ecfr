##### § 3280.506 Heat loss/heat gain. #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 2521, Jan. 12, 2021.Link to a delay published at 86 FR 13645, Mar. 10, 2021.

The manufactured home heat loss/heat gain shall be determined by methods outlined in §§ 3280.508 and 3280.509. The Uo (Coefficient of heat transmission) value zone for which the manufactured home is acceptable and the lowest outdoor temperature to which the installed heating equipment will maintain a temperature of 70 F shall be certified as specified in § 3280.510 of this subpart. The Uo value zone shall be determined from the map in figure 506.

(a) *Coefficient of heat transmission.* The overall coefficient of heat transmission (Uo) of the manufactured home for the respective zones and an indoor design temperature of 70 F, including internal and external ducts, and excluding infiltration, ventilation and condensation control, shall not exceed the Btu/(hr.) (sq. ft.) (F) of the manufactured home envelope are as tabulated below:

|Uo value zone|Maximum coefficient of heat transmission|
|-------------|----------------------------------------|
|      1      |     0.116 Btu/(hr.) (sq. ft.) (F).     |
|      2      |     0.096 Btu/(hr.) (sq. ft.) (F).     |
|      3      |     0.079 Btu/(hr.) (sq. ft.) (F).     |

(b) To assure uniform heat transmission in manufactured homes, cavities in exterior walls, floors, and ceilings shall be provided with thermal insulation.

(c) Manufactured homes designed for Uo Value Zone 3 shall be factory equipped with storm windows or insulating glass.
