##### § 3280.308 Formaldehyde emission controls for certain wood products. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 5566, Jan. 31, 2020.

(a) *Formaldehyde emission levels.* All plywood and particleboard materials bonded with a resin system or coated with a surface finish containing formaldehyde shall not exceed the following formaldehyde emission levels when installed in manufactured homes:

(1) Plywood materials shall not emit formaldehyde in excess of 0.2 parts per million (ppm) as measured by the air chamber test method specified in § 3280.406.

(2) Particleboard materials shall not emit formaldehyde in excess of 0.3 ppm as measured by the air chamber test specified in § 3280.406.

(b) *Product certification and continuing qualification.* All plywood and particleboard materials to be installed in manufactured homes which are bonded with a resin system or coated with a surface finish containing formaldehyde, other than an exclusively phenol-formaldehyde resin system or finish, shall be certified by a nationally recognized testing laboratory as complying with paragraph (a) of this section.

(1) Separate certification shall be done for each plant where the particleboard is produced or where the plywood or particleboard is surface-finished.

(2) To certify plywood or particleboard, the testing laboratory shall witness or conduct the air chamber test specified in § 3280.406 on randomly selected panels initially and at least quarterly thereafter.

(3) The testing laboratory must approve a written quality control plan for each plant where the particleboard is produced or finished or where the plywood is finished. The quality control plan must be designed to assure that all panels comply with paragraph (a) of this section. The plan must establish ongoing procedures to identify increases in the formaldehyde emission characteristics of the finished product resulting from the following changes in production.

(i) In the case of plywood:

(A) The facility where the unfinished panels are produced is changed;

(B) The thickness of the panels is changed so that the panels are thinner; or

(C) The grooving pattern on the panels is changed so that the grooves are deeper or closer together.

(ii) In the case of particleboard:

(A) The resin formulation is changed so that the formaldehyde-to-urea ratio is increased;

(B) The amount of formaldehyde resin used is increased; or

(C) The press time is decreased.

(iii) In the case of plywood or particleboard:

(A) The finishing or top coat is changed and the new finishing or top coat has a greater formaldehyde content; or

(B) The amount of finishing or top coat used on the panels is increased, provided that such finishing or top coat contains formaldehyde.

(4) The testing laboratory shall periodically visit the plant to monitor quality control procedures to assure that all certified panels meet the standard.

(5) To maintain its certification, plywood or particleboard must be tested by the air chamber test specified in § 3280.406 whenever one of the following events occurs:

(i) In the case of particleboard, the resin formulation is changed so that the formaldehyde-to-urea ratio is increased; or

(ii) In the case of particleboard or plywood, the finishing or top coat is changed and the new finishing or top coat contains formaldehyde; or

(iii) In the case of particleboard or plywood, the testing laboratory determines that an air chamber test is necessary to assure that panels comply with paragraph (a) of this section.

(6) In the event that an air chamber test measures levels of formaldehyde from plywood or particleboard in excess of those permitted under paragraph (a) of this section, then the tested product's certification immediately lapses as of the date of production of the tested panels. No panel produced on the same date as the tested panels or on any day thereafter may be used or certified for use in manufactured homes.

(i) Provided, however, that a new product certification may be obtained by testing randomly selected panels which were produced on any day following the date of production of the tested panels. If such panels pass the air chamber test specified in § 3280.406, then the plywood or particleboard produced on that day and subsequent days may be used and certified for use in manufactured homes.

(ii) Provided further, that plywood or particleboard produced on the same day as the tested panels, and panels produced on subsequent days, if not certified pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, may be used in manufactured homes only under the following circumstances:

(A) Each panel is treated with a scavenger, sealant, or other means of reducing formaldehyde emissions which does not adversely affect the structural quality of the product; and

(B) Panels randomly selected from the treated panels are tested by and pass the air chamber test specified in § 3280.406.

(c) *Panel identification.* Each plywood and particleboard panel to be installed in manufactured homes which is bonded or coated with a resin system containing formaldehyde, other than an exclusively phenol-formaldehyde resin system, shall be stamped or labeled so as to identify the product manufacturer, date of production and/or lot number, and the testing laboratory certifying compliance with this section.

(d) *Treatment after certification.* If certified plywood or particleboard subsequently is treated with paint, varnish, or any other substance containing formaldehyde, then the certification is no longer valid. In such a case, each stamp or label placed on the panels pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section must be obliterated. In addition, the treated panels may be recertified and reidentified in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
