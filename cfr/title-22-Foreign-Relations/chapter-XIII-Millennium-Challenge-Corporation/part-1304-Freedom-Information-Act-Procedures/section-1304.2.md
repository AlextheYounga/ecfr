##### § 1304.2 Definitions. #####

*Agency* has the meaning set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552(f)(1).

*Commercial use requester* means a requester seeking information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of himself or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can include furthering those interests through litigation. In determining whether a request properly belongs in this category, the FOIA Officer shall determine the use to which the requester will put the documents requested. Where the FOIA Officer has reasonable cause to doubt the use to which the requester will put the records sought, or where that use is not clear from the request itself, the FOIA Officer shall contact the requester for additional clarification before assigning the request to a specific category.

*Confidential commercial information* means records provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contains material exempt from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.

*Direct costs* mean those expenditures by MCC actually incurred in searching for and duplicating records in response to the FOIA request. These costs include the salary of the employee(s) performing the work (basic rate of pay plus a percentage of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery. Direct costs do not include overhead expenses, such as the cost of space, heating, or lighting of the facility in which the records are stored.

*Duplication* means the process of making a copy of a record in order to respond to a FOIA request, including paper copies, microfilm, audio-video materials, and computer diskettes or other electronic copies.

*Educational institution* refers to a preschool, a public or private elementary or secondary school, an institute of undergraduate higher education, an institute of graduate higher education, an institute of professional education, or an institute of vocational education which operates a program of scholarly research. To qualify for this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.

*FOIA* means the Freedom of Information Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552).

*FOIA Officer* means the MCC employee who is authorized to make determinations as provided in this part. The mailing address for the FOIA Officer is: Millennium Challenge Corporation, Attn: FOIA Officer, 875 Fifteenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005.

*Non-commercial scientific institution* refers to an institution that is not operated on a “commercial” basis as that term is used in paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To qualify for this category, the requester must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are sought to further scholarly research.

*Record* means information or documentary material MCC maintains in any form or format, including an electronic form or format, which MCC:

(1) Made or received under federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business;

(2) Preserved or determined is appropriate for preservation as evidence of MCC operations or activities or because of the value of the information it contains; and

(3) Controls at the time it receives a request.

*Representative of the news media* means any person actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public. The term “news” means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. For a “freelance journalist” to be regarded as working for a news organization, the requester must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that organization, such as a publication contract. Absent such showing, the requester may provide documentation establishing the requester's past publication record. To qualify for this category, the requester must not be seeking the requested records for a commercial use. However, a request for records supporting a news-dissemination function shall not be considered to be for a commercial use.

*Requester* means any person, including an individual, corporation, firm, organization, or other entity, who makes a request to MCC under FOIA for records.

*Review* means the process of examining a record to determine whether all or part of the record may be withheld, and includes redacting or otherwise processing the record for disclosure to a requester. It does not include time spent:

(1) Resolving legal or policy issues regarding the application of exemptions to a record; or

(2) At the administrative appeal level, unless MCC determines that the exemption under which it withheld records does not apply and the records are reviewed again to determine whether a different exemption may apply.

*Search* means the time spent locating records responsive to a request, manually or by electronic means, including page-by-page or line-by-line identification of responsive material within a record.

*Submitter* means any person or entity which provides information directly or indirectly to MCC. The term includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments and foreign governments.

*Working day* means a Federal workday that does not include Saturdays, Sundays, or Federal holidays.
