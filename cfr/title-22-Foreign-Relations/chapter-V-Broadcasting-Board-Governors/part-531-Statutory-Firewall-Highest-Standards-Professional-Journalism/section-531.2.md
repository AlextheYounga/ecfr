##### ยง 531.2 Independence and best practices. #####

(a) USAGM-funded networks each enjoy full editorial independence, as that term is defined and understood by best practices of journalism.

(b) Editorial independence includes, but is not limited to the fact that only individuals within the network may make any decisions with respect to newsgathering or reporting. USAGM networks and their employees, including the heads of each network, are fully insulated from any political or other external pressures or processes that would be inconsistent with the highest standards of professional journalism.

(c) The heads of each network, and everyone else therein, are required at all times to adhere to the highest professional standards of journalism, and must take that into account when carrying out all their responsibilities. The highest professional standards of journalism also require that all elements of newsgathering, editing, and reporting are carried out by professional journalists trained in and held to the highest industry standards.

(d) Each network is required to establish and maintain written rules setting forth the journalistic best practices for their organization, based upon the highest professional standards of professional journalism. These best practices also preclude any journalist or other covered individuals at a network, including the heads of the networks, from engaging in any activity that would call into question their neutrality or impartiality.
