(a) The CFO, through the FMS cross-servicing agreement and by direct action, refers to DOJ for litigation all claims on which aggressive collection actions have been taken but which could not be collected, compromised, suspended or terminated. Referrals are made as early as possible, consistent with aggressive agency collection action, and within the period for bringing a timely suit against the debtor.

Debts of over $1,000,000 shall be referred to the Civil Division at the Department of Justice.
