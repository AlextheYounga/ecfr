##### ยง 213.15 Use of credit reporting bureaus. #####

Delinquent debts owed to USAID are reported to appropriate credit reporting bureaus through the cross-servicing agreement with FMS.

(a) The following information is provided to the credit reporting bureaus:

(1) A statement that the claim is valid and is overdue;

(2) The name, address, taxpayer identification number and any other information necessary to establish the identity of the debtor;

(3) The amount, status and history of the debt; and

(4) The program or pertinent activity under which the debt arose.

(b) Before referring claims to FMS and disclosing debt information to credit reporting bureaus, USAID will have:

(1) Taken reasonable action to locate the debtor if a current address is not available; and

(2) If a current address is available, notified the debtor in writing that:

(i) The designated USAID official has reviewed the claim and has determined that it is valid and overdue;

(ii) That 90 days after the initial billing or demand letter if the debt is not paid, USAID intends to refer the debt to FMS and disclose to a credit reporting agency the information authorized for disclosure by this subpart; and

(iii) The debtor can request a complete explanation of the claim, can dispute the information in USAID's records concerning the claim, and can file for an administrative review, waiver or reconsideration of the claim, where applicable.

(c) Before information is submitted to a credit reporting bureau, USAID will provide a written statement to FMS that all required actions have been taken. Additionally, FMS will, thereafter, ensure that accounts are updated as necessary during the period that FMS holds the account information.

(d) If a debtor disputes the validity of the debt, the credit reporting bureau will refer the matter to the appropriate USAID official. The credit reporting bureau will exclude the debt from its reports until USAID certifies in writing that the debt is valid.
