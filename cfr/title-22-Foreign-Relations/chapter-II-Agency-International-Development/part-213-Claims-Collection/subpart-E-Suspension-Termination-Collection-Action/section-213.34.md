##### § 213.34 Debts that have been discharged in bankruptcy. #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 31145, June 11, 2021.

USAID generally terminates collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy regardless of the amount. USAID may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. The CFO will seek legal advice by the General Counsel's office if he believes that any claims or offsets may have survived the discharge of a debtor.
