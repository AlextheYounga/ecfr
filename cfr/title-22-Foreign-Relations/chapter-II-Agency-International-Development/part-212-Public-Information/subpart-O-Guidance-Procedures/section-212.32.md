(2) To create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another Federal Department or Agency;

(3) To alter materially the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or

(4) To raise novel legal or policy issues that arise out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866, as further amended.
