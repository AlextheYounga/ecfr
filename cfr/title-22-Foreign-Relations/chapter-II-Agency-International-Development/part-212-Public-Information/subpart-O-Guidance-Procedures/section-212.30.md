##### § 212.30 Good-faith cost estimates. #####

Even though not legally binding, some Agency guidance could result in a substantial economic impact. For example, the issuance of Agency guidance could induce private parties to alter their conduct to conform to recommended standards or practices, such that they could incur costs beyond the costs of complying with existing statutes and regulations. While it might be difficult to predict with precision the economic impact of voluntary guidance, to the extent practicable the proposing B/IO within USAID shall make a good-faith effort to estimate the likely economic cost impact of the guidance document to determine whether it might qualify as “significant.” When a B/IO is assessing or explaining whether it believes a guidance document is significant, it should, at a minimum, provide the same level of analysis that would be required for a determination under the Congressional Review Act (M-19-14), *Guidance on Compliance with the Congressional Review Act,* that the guidance document is major. When USAID determines that a guidance document will be “economically significant,” the proposing B/IO should conduct and publish a regulatory-impact analysis of the sort that would accompany an economically significant rulemaking, to the extent reasonably possible (in conformance with E.O. 12866).
