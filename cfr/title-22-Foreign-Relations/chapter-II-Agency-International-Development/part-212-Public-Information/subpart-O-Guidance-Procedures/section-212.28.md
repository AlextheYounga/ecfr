##### § 212.28 Requirements for clearance. #####

USAID's review and clearance of guidance documents shall ensure that each one that a B/IO within the Agency proposes to issue satisfies the following requirements:

(a) The guidance document complies with all relevant statutes and regulations (including any statutory deadlines for the Agency's action);

(b) The guidance document identifies or includes the following:

(1) The term “guidance” or its functional equivalent;

(2) The issuing B/IO within the Agency;

(3) A unique identifier, including, at a minimum, the date of issuance and title of the document and a Regulation Identifier Number (RIN), if applicable;

(4) The activity or entities to which the guidance applies;

(5) Citations to applicable statutes and regulations;

(6) A statement that notes whether the guidance is intended to revise or replace any previously issued guidance and, if so, sufficient information to identify the previously issued guidance; and

(7) A short summary at the top of the document of the subject matter covered in the guidance document.

(c) The guidance document avoids using mandatory language, such as “shall,” “must,” “required,” or “requirement,” unless the language is describing an established statutory or regulatory requirement, or is addressed to USAID's staff and will not foreclose the Agency's consideration of positions advanced by affected private parties; and

(d) The guidance document is written in plain and understandable English. All guidance documents should include a clear and prominent statement to declare that the contents of the document do not have the force and effect of law and are not meant to bind the public in any way, and the document is intended only to provide clarity to the public regarding existing requirements under the law or USAID's policies.
