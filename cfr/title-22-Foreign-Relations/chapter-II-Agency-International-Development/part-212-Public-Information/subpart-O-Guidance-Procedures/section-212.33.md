##### § 212.33 Designation procedures. #####

(a) The Bureau for Management may request a B/IO within USAID to prepare a designation request for certain guidance documents. Designation requests must include the following information:

(1) A summary of the guidance document; and

(2) The B/IO's recommended designation of “not significant,” “significant,” or “economically significant,” as well as a justification for that designation.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the Agency will seek significance determinations from OMB/OIRA for certain guidance documents, as appropriate, in the same manner as for rulemakings. Prior to publishing these guidance documents, after internal consultation and review, the Bureau for Management shall submit the document to OMB/OIRA for review under the provisions in Section 6 of E.O. 12866 to determine if it meets the definition of “significant” or “economically significant.”

(c) All “guidance documents” as with rulemakings, receive a significance determination from OMB/OIRA, unless explicitly exempt from E.O. 12866. Note that the only documents that do not receive designations are those that fall outside the definition of “guidance” or within a group categorically considered nonsignificant as agreed upon by OMB/OIRA in Memorandum M-20-02).
