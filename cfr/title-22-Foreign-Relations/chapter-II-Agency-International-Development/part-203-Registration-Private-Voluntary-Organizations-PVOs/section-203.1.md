##### ยง 203.1 Purpose. #####

(a) USAID registers PVOs to:

(1) Meet statutory and regulatory requirements that a U.S. PVO be registered with USAID as a condition for USAID funding.

(2) Provide USAID with information for computing the amount of USAID funding made available to PVOs.

(b) It is not the purpose of registration to allow or enable registered PVOs to make any representation to the public concerning the meaning of being registered with USAID. Promotional materials or advertisements suggesting otherwise will be grounds for removal from the USAID PVO Registry.

(c) Registration does not bring an organization within the Ambassador's authority and responsibility for the security of U.S. Government operations and personnel abroad.
