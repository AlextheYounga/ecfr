##### § 1502.4 Written requests. #####

In order to facilitate the processing of written requests, every petitioner should:

(a) Address his or her request to: Director, Administration and Finance Division, African Development Foundation, 1724 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036.

Both the envelope and the request itself should be clearly marked: “Freedom of Information Act Request.”

(b) Identify the desired record by name, title, author, a brief description, or number, and date, as applicable. The identification should be specific enough so that a record can be identified and found without unreasonably burdening or disrupting the operations of the Foundation. Blanket requests or requests for “the entire file of” or “all matters relating to” a specified subject will not be accepted. If the Foundation determines that a request does not reasonably describe the records sought, the requestor shall be advised what additional information is needed or informed why the request is insufficient.

(c) Include a check or money order to the order of the “African Development Foundation” covering the appropriate search and copying fees, or a request for determination of the fee and a promise to pay any amount over $3.00 in connection with the FOIA request.
