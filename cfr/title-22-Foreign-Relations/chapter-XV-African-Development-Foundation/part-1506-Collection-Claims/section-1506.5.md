(a) A total of three progressively stronger written demands at approximately 30-day intervals will normally be made, unless a response or other information indicates that additional written demands would either be unnecessary or futile.

(b) The initial written demand for payment shall inform the debtor of:

(1) The basis for the claim;

(2) The amount of the claim;

(3) The date when payment is due, 30 days, from date of mailing or hand delivery of the intial demand for payment;

(4) The provision for late payment (interest), penalty and administrative charges, if payment is not received by the due date.
