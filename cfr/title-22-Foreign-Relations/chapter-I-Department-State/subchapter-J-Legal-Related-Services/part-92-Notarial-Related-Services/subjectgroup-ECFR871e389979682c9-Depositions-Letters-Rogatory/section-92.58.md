##### ยง 92.58 Examination on basis of written interrogatories. #####

Written interrogatories are usually divided into three parts:

(a) The direct interrogatories or interrogatories in chief;

(b) The cross-interrogatories; and

(c) The redirect interrogatories.

Recross-interrogatories sometimes follow redirect interrogatories. The notarizing officer should not furnish the witness with a copy of the interrogatories in advance of the questioning, nor should he allow the witness to examine the interrogatories in advance of the questioning. Although it may be necessary for the officer, when communicating with the witness for the purpose of asking him to appear to testify, to indicate in general terms the nature of the evidence which is being sought, this information should not be given in such detail as to permit the witness to formulate his answers to the interrogatories prior to his appearance before the notarizing officer. The officer taking the deposition should put the interrogatories to the witness separately and in order. The written interrogatories should not be repeated in the record (unless special instructions to that effect are given), but an appropriate reference should be made thereto. These references should, of course, be followed by the witness' answers. All of the written interrogatories must be put to the witness, even though at some point during the examination the witness disclaims further knowledge of the subject. When counsel for all of the parties attend an examination conducted on written interrogatories, the notarizing officer may, all counsel having consented thereto, permit oral examination of the witness following the close of the examination upon written interrogatories. The oral examination should be conducted in the same manner and order as if not preceded by an examination upon written interrogatories.[22 FR 10858, Dec. 27, 1957, as amended at 60 FR 51723, Oct. 3, 1995; 61 FR 14375, Apr. 1, 1996]
