##### § 140.4 Applicability. #####

Except as otherwise provided herein or as otherwise specially determined by the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee (except that decisions on notification and/or disclosure shall in all cases be subject to the provisions of §§ 140.13 through 140.14), the procedures prescribed by this part apply to any “covered individual or entity,” *i.e.*, any individual or entity, including a foreign government entity, a multilateral institution or international organization, or a U.S. or foreign non-governmental entity:

(a)(1) That is receiving or providing covered assistance as a party to a grant, loan, guarantee, cooperative agreement, contract, or other direct agreement with an agency of the United States (a “first-tier” recipient); or

(2) That is receiving covered assistance

(A) Beyond the first tier if specifically designated to receive such assistance by a U.S. government agency; or

(B) In the form of a scholarship, fellowship, or participant training, except certain recipients funded through a multilateral institution or international organization, as provided in § 140.7(c); and

(b)(1) That is located in or providing covered assistance within a covered country or within any other country, or portion thereof, that the Secretary of State or the Secretary's designee may at any time determine should be treated, in order to fulfill the purpose of this part, as if it were a covered country; or

(2) As to which the agency providing assistance or any other interested agency has reasonable grounds to suspect current or past involvement in drug trafficking or conviction of a narcotics offense, regardless of whether the assistance is provided within a covered country.

Examples:(1) Under a $500,000 bilateral grant agreement with the Agency for International Development providing covered assistance, Ministry Y of Government A, the government of a covered country, enters into a $150,000 contract with Corporation X. Ministry Y is a covered entity. However, Corporation X is *not* a covered entity because the contract is *not* a direct contract with an agency of the United States.

(2) Under a $1,000,000 grant from the Department of State providing covered assistance, Corporation B makes a $120,000 subgrant to University Y for the training of 12 individuals. If Corporation B is located in or providing assistance within a covered country, it is a covered entity and the 12 individuals receiving participant training are covered individuals. University Y is *not* a covered entity.

(3) University C, which is not located in a covered country, receives a $1 million regional assistance research project grant from the Agency for International development, $80,000 of which is provided for research in covered countries. University C is *not* a covered entity. (However, if $100,000 or more were provided for research in a covered country or countries, or if University C were located in a covered country, then University C would be a covered entity.)
