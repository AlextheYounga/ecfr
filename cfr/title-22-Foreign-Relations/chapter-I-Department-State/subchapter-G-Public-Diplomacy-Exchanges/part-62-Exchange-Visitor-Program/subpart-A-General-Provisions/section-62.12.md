(a) *Issuance of Forms DS-2019.* Sponsors must:

(1) Grant access only to Responsible Officers and Alternate Responsible Officers and ensure that they have access to and use SEVIS to update required information;

(2) Ensure that Responsible Officers and Alternate Responsible Officers input into SEVIS accurate, current, and updated information in accordance with these regulations; and

(3) Issue Forms DS-2019 only for the following authorized purposes:

(i) To facilitate the initial entry of the exchange visitor and accompanying spouse and dependents, if any, into the United States;

(ii) To extend the duration of participation of an exchange visitor, when permitted by the regulations and authorized by the Department of State;

(iii) To facilitate program transfers, when permitted by the regulations and/or authorized in writing by the Department of State;

(iv) To replace lost, stolen, or damaged Forms DS-2019;

(v) To facilitate the re-entry into the United States of an exchange visitor and accompanying spouse and dependents, if any, who travel outside the United States during the exchange visitor's program;

(vi) To facilitate a change of category, when requested in SEVIS and authorized by the Department of State;

(vii) To update information when significant changes take place in regard to the exchange visitor's program (e.g., a substantial change in funding, a change in the primary site of activity or a change in actual and current U.S. address);

(viii) To facilitate the correction of a minor or technical infraction; or

(ix) To facilitate a “reinstatement” or a “reinstatement update SEVIS status” when permitted by the Department of State.

(b) *Verification.* (1) Prior to issuing Forms DS-2019, sponsors must verify that each prospective exchange visitor:

(i) Is eligible and qualified for, and accepted into, the program in which he or she will participate;

(ii) Possesses adequate financial resources to participate in and complete his or her exchange visitor program; and

(iii) Possesses adequate financial resources to support an accompanying spouse and dependents, if any.

(ii) Only the Responsible Officer or the Alternate Responsible Officer, whose name is printed on the Form DS-2019, is permitted to sign the document. The Form DS-2019 must be signed in blue ink to denote that it is the original document.

(d) *Allotment requests.* (1) Annual Form DS-2019 allotment. Sponsors must submit an electronic request via SEVIS to the Department of State for an annual allotment of Forms DS-2019 based on the annual reporting cycle (e.g., academic, calendar or fiscal year) stated in their letter of designation or redesignation.

(e) *Safeguards and controls.* (1) Responsible Officers and Alternate Responsible Officers must secure their SEVIS logon Identification Numbers (IDs) and passwords at all times (*i.e.*, not share IDs and passwords with any other person or permit access to and use of SEVIS by any other person).
