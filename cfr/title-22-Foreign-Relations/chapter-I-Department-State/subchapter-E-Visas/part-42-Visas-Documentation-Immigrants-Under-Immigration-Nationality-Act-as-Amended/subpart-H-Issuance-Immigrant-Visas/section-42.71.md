##### ยง 42.71 Authority to issue visas; visa fees. #####

(a) *Authority to issue visas.* Consular officers may issue immigrant visas at designated consular offices abroad pursuant to the authority contained in INA 101(a)(16), 221(a), and 224. (Consular offices designated to issue immigrant visas are listed periodically in Visa Office Bulletins published at *www.travel.state.gov* by the Department of State.) A consular officer assigned to duty in the territory of a country against which the sanctions provided in INA 243(d) have been invoked must not issue an immigrant visa to an alien who is a national, citizen, subject, or resident of that country, unless the officer has been informed that the sanction has been waived by DHS in the case of an individual alien or a specified class of aliens.

(b) *Immigrant visa fees.* The Secretary of State prescribes a fee for the processing of immigrant visa applications. An individual registered for immigrant visa processing at a post designated for this purpose by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services must pay the processing fee upon being notified that a visa is expected to become available in the near future and being requested to obtain the supporting documentation needed to apply formally for a visa. A fee collected for the processing of an immigrant visa application is refundable only if the principal officer of a post or the officer in charge of a consular section determines that the application was not adjudicated as a result of action by the U. S. Government over which the alien had no control and for which the alien was not responsible, that precluded the applicant from benefiting from the processing.
