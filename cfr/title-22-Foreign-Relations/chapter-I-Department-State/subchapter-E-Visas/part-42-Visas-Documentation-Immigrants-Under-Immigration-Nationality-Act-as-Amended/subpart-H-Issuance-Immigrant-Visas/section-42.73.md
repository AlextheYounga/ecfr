##### § 42.73 Procedure in issuing visas. #####

(a) *Insertion of data.* In issuing an immigrant visa, the issuing office shall insert the pertinent information in the designated blank spaces provided on Form OF-55B, Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, in accordance with the instructions contained in this section.

(1) A symbol as specified in § 42.11 shall be used to indicate the classification of the immigrant.

(2) An immigrant visa issued to an alien subject to numerical limitations shall bear a number allocated by the Department. The foreign state or dependent area limitation to which the alien is chargeable shall be entered in the space provided.

(3) No entry need be made in the space provided for foreign state or other applicable area limitation on visas issued to aliens in the classifications set forth in § 42.12(a)(1)-(7), but such visas may be numbered if a post voluntarily uses a consecutive post numbering system.

(4) The date of issuance and the date of expiration of the visa shall be inserted in the proper places on the visa and show the day, month, and year in that order, with the name of the month spelled out, as in “24 December 1986.”

(5) In the event the passport requirement has been waived under § 42.2, a notation shall be inserted in the space provided for the passport number, setting forth the authority (section and paragraph) under which the passport was waived.

(6) A signed photograph shall be attached in the space provided on Form OF-55B by the use of a legend machine, unless specific authorization has been granted by the Department to use the impression seal.

(b) *Documents comprising an immigrant visa.* An immigrant visa consists of Form OF-155B and Form DS-230, Application for Immigrant Visa and Alien Registration, properly executed, and a copy of each document required pursuant to § 42.63.

(c) *Arrangement of visa documentation.* Form OF-155B shall be placed immediately above Form DS-230 and the supporting documents attached thereto. Any document required to be attached to the visa, if furnished to the consular officer by the alien's sponsor or other person with a request that the contents not be divulged to the visa applicant, shall be placed in an envelope and sealed with the impression seal of the consular office before being attached to the visa. If an immigrant visa is issued to an alien in possession of a United States reentry permit, valid or expired, the consular officer shall attach the permit to the immigrant visa for disposition by DHS at the port of entry. (Documents having no bearing on the alien's qualifications or eligiblity to receive a visa may be returned to the alien or to the person who furnished them.)

(d) *Signature, seal, and issuance of visa.* The consular officer shall sign the visa (Form OF-155B) and impress the seal of the office on it so as to partially cover the photograph and the signature. The immigrant visa shall then be issued by delivery to the immigrant or the immigrant's authorized agent or representative.
