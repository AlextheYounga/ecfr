(a) The provisions of this subchapter do not apply to articles, technical data, or services in Category VI, Category XV, Category XVI, or Category XX of § 121.1 of this subchapter to the extent that exports of such articles, technical data, or services are controlled by the Department of Energy or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, as amended, or is a government transfer authorized pursuant to these Acts. For Department of Commerce controls, *see* 15 CFR 742.3 and 744.2, administered pursuant to Section 309(c) of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2139a(c)), and 15 CFR 744.5, which are not subject to this subchapter.

(b) The transfer of materials, including special nuclear materials, nuclear parts of nuclear weapons, or other non-nuclear parts of nuclear weapons systems involving Restricted Data or of assistance involving any person directly or indirectly engaging in the production or use thereof is prohibited except as authorized by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. The transfer of Restricted Data or such assistance is prohibited except as authorized by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. The technical data or defense services relating to nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons systems or related defense purposes (and such data or services relating to applications of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, or related research and development) may constitute Restricted Data or such assistance, subject to the foregoing prohibition.

(c) A license for the export of a defense article, technical data, or the furnishing of a defense service relating to defense articles referred to in Category VI(e) or Category XX(b)(1) of § 121.1 of this subchapter will not be granted unless the defense article, technical data, or defense service comes within the scope of an existing Agreement for Cooperation for Mutual Defense Purposes concluded pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with the government of the country to which the defense article, technical data, or defense service is to be exported. Licenses may be granted in the absence of such an agreement only:

(1) If the proposed export involves an article which is identical to that in use in an unclassified civilian nuclear power plant,

(2) If the proposed export has no relationship to naval nuclear propulsion, and

(3) If it is not for use in a naval propulsion plant.
