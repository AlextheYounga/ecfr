##### § 126.1 Prohibited exports, imports, and sales to or from certain countries. #####

(a) *General.* It is the policy of the United States to deny licenses and other approvals for exports and imports of defense articles and defense services, destined for or originating in certain countries. The exemptions provided in this subchapter, except § 123.17 of this subchapter and §§ 126.4(a)(1) or (3) and (b)(1) and 126.6, or when the recipient is a U.S. Government department or agency, do not apply with respect to defense articles or defense services originating in or for export to any proscribed countries, areas, or persons. (See § 129.7 of this subchapter, which imposes restrictions on brokering activities similar to those in this section).

(b) *Shipments.* A defense article licensed or otherwise authorized for export, temporary import, reexport, or retransfer under this subchapter may not be shipped on a vessel, aircraft, spacecraft, or other means of conveyance that is owned by, operated by, leased to, or leased from any of the proscribed countries, areas, or other persons referred to in this section.

(c) Identification in § 126.1 of the ITAR may derive from:

(1) *Exports and sales prohibited by United Nations Security Council sanctions measures.* Whenever the United Nations Security Council mandates sanctions measures, all transactions that are prohibited by the aforementioned measures and involve U.S. persons (see § 120.15 of this subchapter) inside or outside of the United States, or any person in the United States, and defense articles or defense services described on the United States Munitions List (22 CFR part 121), irrespective of origin, are prohibited under the ITAR for the duration of the sanction, unless the Department of State publishes a notice in the Federal Register specifying different measures.

(2) *Terrorism.* Exports or temporary imports of defense articles or defense services to countries that the Secretary of State has determined to be State Sponsors of Terrorism are prohibited under the ITAR. These countries have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, which is contrary to the foreign policy of the United States and thus subject to the policy specified in paragraph (a) of this section and the requirements of section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2780) and the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 (22 U.S.C. 4801). Exports to countries that the Secretary of State has determined and certified to Congress, pursuant to section 40A of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2781) and Executive Order 13637, are not cooperating fully with United States antiterrorism efforts are subject to the policy specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The Secretary of State makes such determinations and certifications annually.

(3) *Arms embargoes and sanctions.* The policy specified in paragraph (a) of this section applies to countries subject to a United States arms embargo or sanctions regime, such as those described in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 *et seq.*), the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6401 *et seq.*), or the Child Soldiers Prevention Act of 2008 (22 U.S.C. 2370c-2370c-2), or whenever an export of defense articles or defense services would not otherwise be in furtherance of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States.
