##### ยง 708.3 Scheduling of a meeting. #####

A decision to hold a meeting of the Board of Directors should be made as provided in the By-laws of the Corporation and at least eight days prior to the scheduled meeting date in order for the Secretary of the Corporation to give the public notice required by ยง 708.4. However in special cases, a majority of the Directors may decide to hold a meeting less than eight days prior to the scheduled meeting date if they determine by a recorded vote that Corporation business requires such meeting at such earlier date. After public announcement of a meeting of the Board of Directors under the provisions of ยง 708.4, the subject matter thereof, or the determination to open or close a meeting, or portion thereof, may only be changed if a majority of the Directors determines by a recorded vote that business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change is possible.
