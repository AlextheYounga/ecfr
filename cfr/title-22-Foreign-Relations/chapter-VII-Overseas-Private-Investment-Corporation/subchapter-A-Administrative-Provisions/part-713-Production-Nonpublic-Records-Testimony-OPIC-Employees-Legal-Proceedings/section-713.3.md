##### ยง 713.3 How do I request nonpublic records or testimony? #####

To request nonpublic records or the testimony of an OPIC employee, you must submit a written request as described in ยง 713.4 to the Vice-President/General Counsel of OPIC. If you serve a subpoena on OPIC or an OPIC employee before submitting a written request and receiving a final determination, OPIC will oppose the subpoena on the grounds that you failed to follow the requirements of this part.
