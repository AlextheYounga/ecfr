##### ยง 708.5 Closed meetings. #####

(a) Meetings of the Board of Directors will be closed to public observation where the Corporation properly determines, according to the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, that such portion or portions of the meeting or disclosure of such information is likely to:

(1) Disclose matters that are (i) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interests of national defense or foreign policy and are (ii) in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;

(2) Relate solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;

(3) Disclose matters specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552), *Provided,* That such statute (i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;

(4) Disclose the trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;

(5) Involve accusing any person of a crime, or formally censuring any person;

(6) Disclose information of a personal nature where disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(7) Disclose investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, or information which if written would be contained in such records, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would (i) interfere with enforcement proceedings, (ii) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (iii) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (iv) disclose the identity of a confidential source and, in the case of a record compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, confidential information furnished only by the confidential source, (v) disclose investigative techniques and procedures, or (vi) endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel;

(8) Disclose information the premature disclosure of which would be likely to significantly frustrate implementation of a proposed agency action, except in any instance where the Corporation has already disclosed to the public the content or nature of its proposed action, or where the Corporation is required by law to make such disclosure on its own initiative prior to taking final Corporation action on such proposal; or

(9) Specifically concern the Corporation's participation in a civil action or proceeding, an action in a foreign court or international tribunal, or an arbitration, or the initiation, conduct, or disposition by the Corporation of a particular case of formal Corporation adjudication pursuant to the procedures in 5 U.S.C. 554 or otherwise involving a determination on the record after opportunity for a hearing.

(b) Meetings of the Board of Directors shall not be closed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section when the Corporation finds that the public interest requires that they be open.

(c)(1) Action to close a meeting, or portion thereof, pursuant to the exemptions defined in paragraph (a) of this section may be initiated by the President or any Director of the Corporation by presentation of a request for closure to the Board of Directors. The person initiating the request for closure shall give the Board of Directors a statement specifying the extent of the proposed closure, the relevant exemptive provisions and the circumstances pertinent to such request, and how the public interest will be served by closure. Such statement shall also be given to the General Counsel of the Corporation to serve as a basis for the certification the General Counsel may determine can be issued in accordance with ยง 708.6. The General Counsel's determination shall be given to the Board of Directors. Action to close a meeting, or portion thereof, shall be taken only when a majority of the entire membership of the Board of Directors votes to take such action. A separate vote of the Board of Directors shall be taken with respect to each meeting of the Board of Directors a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld. A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Director participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.

(2) Whenever any person whose interests may be directly affected by a portion of a meeting requests that the Corporation close such portion to the public for any of the reasons referred to in paragraph (a)(5), (a)(6), or (a)(7) of this section, the Corporation, upon request of any one of its Directors, shall vote by recorded vote whether to close such meeting.

(3) Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall make publicly available a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Secretary shall, by the close of the business day next succeeding the day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, make publicly available a full written explanation of the Corporation's action closing the portion together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation. The information required by this subparagraph shall be disclosed except to the extent that it is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section.
