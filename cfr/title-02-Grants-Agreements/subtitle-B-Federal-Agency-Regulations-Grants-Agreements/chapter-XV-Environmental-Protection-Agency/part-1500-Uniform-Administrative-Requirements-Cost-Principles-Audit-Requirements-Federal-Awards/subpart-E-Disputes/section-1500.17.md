An Affected Entity may file an electronic written request for review of the DDO's Appeal decision to the appropriate Review Official within 15 calendar days from the date the Appeal decision is electronically sent to the Affected Entity. The request for review must comply with the following requirements:

(a) *Submission of request for review.* The request must be submitted to the Review Official identified in the Appeal decision as follows:

(1) If a Headquarters DDO issued the Appeal decision, the request must be electronically submitted to the Director of the Office of Grants and Debarment, or designee, at the email address identified in the Appeal decision, with a copy to the DDO.

(2) If the Appeal decision was issued by a DDO located in an agency Regional Office, the request for review must be electronically submitted to the Regional Administrator, or designee, at the email address identified in the Appeal decision, with a copy to the DDO.

(b) *Contents and grounds of request for review.* The request for review must include a copy of the DDO's Appeal decision and provide a detailed statement of the factual and legal grounds warranting reversal or modification of the Appeal decision. The only ground for review of a DDO's Appeal decision is that there was a clear and prejudicial error of law, fact or application of agency policy in deciding the Appeal.

(c) *Conducting the review.* In reviewing the Appeal decision, the Review Official will only consider the information that was part of the Appeal decision unless:

(1) The Affected Entity provides new information in the request for review that was not available to the DDO for the Appeal decision; and

(2) The Review Official determines that the new information is relevant and should be considered in the interests of fairness and equity.
