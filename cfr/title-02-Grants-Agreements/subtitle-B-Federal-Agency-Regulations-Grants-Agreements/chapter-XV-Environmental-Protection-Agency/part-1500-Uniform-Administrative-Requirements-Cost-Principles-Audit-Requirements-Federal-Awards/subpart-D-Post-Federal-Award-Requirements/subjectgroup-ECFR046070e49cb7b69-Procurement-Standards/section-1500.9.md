##### § 1500.9 General Procurement Standards. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 61573, Sept. 30, 2020.

(a) *Payment to consultants.* EPA will limit its participation in the salary rate (excluding overhead) paid to individual consultants retained by recipients or by a recipient's contractors or subcontractors to the maximum daily rate for level 4 of the Executive Schedule unless a greater amount is authorized by law. (Recipient's may, however, pay consultants more than this amount with non EPA funds.) This limitation applies to consultation services of designated individuals with specialized skills who are paid at a daily or hourly rate. This rate does not include transportation and subsistence costs for travel performed; recipients will pay these in accordance with their normal travel reimbursement practices. Contracts with firms for services which are awarded using the procurement standards in Subpart D of 2 CFR part 200 are not affected by this limitation.

(b) Subawards with firms for services which are awarded using the procurement standards in 2 CFR 200.317 through 2 CFR 200.326 are not affected by this limitation.
