Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 71816, Nov. 12, 2020.

(a) This part establishes policies and procedures for grants and cooperative agreements awarded by NASA to non-Federal entities, commercial firms (when cost sharing is not required), and foreign organizations as allowed by 2 CFR 200.101 Applicability. The policies and procedures that you must follow are those appearing in subparts A through F of 2 CFR part 200 and as supplemented by 2 CFR part 1800. For supplemental guidance, NASA has adopted section numbers that correspond to those in the OMB guidance in 2 CFR part 200.

(b) Throughout this part, the term “award” refers to both “grant” and “cooperative agreement” unless otherwise indicated.

(c) When commercial firms are required to provide cost sharing pursuant to 2 CFR 200.306, Cost Sharing, the regulations at 14 CFR part 1274 apply.

(d)(1) In general, research with foreign organizations will not be conducted through grants or cooperative agreements, but instead will be accomplished on a no-exchange-of-funds basis. In these cases, NASA enters into agreements undertaking projects of international scientific collaboration. NASA policy on performing research with foreign organizations on a no-exchange-of-funds basis is set forth at NASA FAR Supplement (NFS) 1835.016-70. In rare instances, NASA may enter into an international agreement under which funds will be transferred to a foreign recipient.

(2) Grants or cooperative agreements awarded to foreign organizations are made on an exceptional basis only. Awards require the prior approval of the Headquarters Office of International and Interagency Relations and the Headquarters Office of the General Counsel. Requests to issue awards to foreign organizations are to be coordinated through the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Policy Division.
