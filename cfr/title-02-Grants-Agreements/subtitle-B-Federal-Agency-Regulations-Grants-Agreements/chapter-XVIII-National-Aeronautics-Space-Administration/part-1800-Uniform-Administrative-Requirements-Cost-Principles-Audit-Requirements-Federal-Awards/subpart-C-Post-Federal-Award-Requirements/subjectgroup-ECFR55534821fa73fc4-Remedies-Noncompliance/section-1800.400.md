Payment of fee or profit is consistent with an activity whose principal purpose is the acquisition of goods and services for the direct benefit or use of the United States Government, rather than an activity whose principal purpose is Federal financial assistance to a recipient to carry out a public purpose. Therefore, the Grants Officer shall use a procurement contract, rather than a grant or cooperative agreement, in all cases where fee or profit is to be paid to the recipient of the instrument or the instrument is to be used to carry out a program where fee or profit is necessary to achieving program objectives. Grants and cooperative agreements shall not provide for the payment of any fee or profit to the recipient.
