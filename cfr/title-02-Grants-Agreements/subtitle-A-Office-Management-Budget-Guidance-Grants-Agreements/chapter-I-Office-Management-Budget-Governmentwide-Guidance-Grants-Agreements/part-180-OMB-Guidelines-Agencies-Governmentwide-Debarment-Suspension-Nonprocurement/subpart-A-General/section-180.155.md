##### ยง 180.155 How do I know if a person is excluded? #####

Check the Governmentwide System for Award Management Exclusions (SAM Exclusions) to determine whether a person is excluded. The General Services Administration (GSA) maintains the SAM Exclusions and makes it available, as detailed in Subpart E of this part. When a Federal agency takes an action to exclude a person under the nonprocurement or procurement debarment and suspension system, the agency enters the information about the excluded person into the SAM Exclusions.
