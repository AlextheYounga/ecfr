Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 49523, Aug. 13, 2020.

(a) An agency may not make an award to an entity until the entity has complied with the requirements described in ยง 25.200 to provide a valid unique entity identifier and maintain an active SAM registration with current information (other than any requirement that is not applicable because the entity is exempted under ยง 25.110).

(b) At the time an agency is ready to make an award, if the intended recipient has not complied with an applicable requirement to provide a unique entity identifier or maintain an active SAM registration with current information, the agency:

(1) May determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive an award; and

(2) May use that determination as a basis for making an award to another applicant.
