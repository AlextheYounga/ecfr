##### ยง 25.205 Effect of noncompliance with a requirement to obtain a unique entity identifier or register in the SAM. #####

(a) A Federal awarding agency may not make a Federal award or financial modification to an existing Federal award to an applicant or recipient until the entity has complied with the requirements described in ยง 25.200 to provide a valid unique entity identifier and maintain an active SAM registration with current information (other than any requirement that is not applicable because the entity is exempted under ยง 25.110).

(b) At the time a Federal awarding agency is ready to make a Federal award, if the intended recipient has not complied with an applicable requirement to provide a unique entity identifier or maintain an active SAM registration with current information, the Federal awarding agency:

(1) May determine that the applicant is not qualified to receive a Federal award; and

(2) May use that determination as a basis for making a Federal award to another applicant.
