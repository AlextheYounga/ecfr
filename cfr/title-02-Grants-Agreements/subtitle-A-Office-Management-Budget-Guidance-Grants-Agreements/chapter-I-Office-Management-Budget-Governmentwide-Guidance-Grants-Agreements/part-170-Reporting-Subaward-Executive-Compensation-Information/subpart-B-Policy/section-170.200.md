##### ยง 170.200 Federal awarding agency reporting requirements. #####

(a) Federal awarding agencies are required to publicly report Federal awards that equal or exceed the micro-purchase threshold and publish the required information on a public-facing, OMB-designated, governmentwide website and follow OMB guidance to support Transparency Act implementation.
