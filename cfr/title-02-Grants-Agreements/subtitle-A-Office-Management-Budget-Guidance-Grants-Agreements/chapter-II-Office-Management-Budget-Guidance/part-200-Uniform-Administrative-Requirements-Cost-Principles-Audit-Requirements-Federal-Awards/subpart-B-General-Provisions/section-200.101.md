##### § 200.101 Applicability. #####

(a) *General applicability to Federal agencies.* The requirements established in this part apply to Federal agencies that make Federal awards to non-Federal entities. These requirements are applicable to all costs related to Federal awards.

(b)(1) *Applicability to different types of Federal awards.* The following table describes what portions of this part apply to which types of Federal awards. The terms and conditions of Federal awards (including this part) flow down to subawards to subrecipients unless a particular section of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate otherwise. This means that non-Federal entities must comply with requirements in this part regardless of whether the non-Federal entity is a recipient or subrecipient of a Federal award. Pass-through entities must comply with the requirements described in Subpart D - Post Federal Award Requirements of this part, §§ 200.330 Subrecipient and contractor determinations through 200.332 Fixed amount Subawards, but not any requirements in this part directed towards Federal awarding agencies unless the requirements of this part or the terms and conditions of the Federal award indicate otherwise.

(2) *Federal award of cost-reimbursement contract under the FAR to a non-Federal entity.* When a non-Federal entity is awarded a cost-reimbursement contract, only Subpart D - Post Federal Award Requirements of this part, §§ 200.330 Subrecipient and contractor determinations through 200.332 Fixed amount Subawards (in addition to any FAR related requirements for subaward monitoring), Subpart E - Cost Principles of this part and Subpart F - Audit Requirements of this part are incorporated by reference into the contract. However, when the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) are applicable to the contract, they take precedence over the requirements of this part except for Subpart F - Audit Requirements of this part when they are in conflict. In addition, costs that are made unallowable under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a) as described in the FAR subpart 31.2 and subpart 31.603 are always unallowable.

(c) Federal awarding agencies may apply subparts A through E of this part to for-profit entities, foreign public entities, or foreign organizations, except where the Federal awarding agency determines that the application of these subparts would be inconsistent with the international obligations of the United States or the statutes or regulations of a foreign government.
