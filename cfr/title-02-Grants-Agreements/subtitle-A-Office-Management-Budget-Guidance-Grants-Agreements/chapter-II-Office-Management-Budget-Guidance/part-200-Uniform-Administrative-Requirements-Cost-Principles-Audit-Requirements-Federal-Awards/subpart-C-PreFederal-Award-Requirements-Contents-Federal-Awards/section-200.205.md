##### ยง 200.205 Federal awarding agency review of merit of proposals. #####

For discretionary Federal awards, unless prohibited by Federal statute, the Federal awarding agency must design and execute a merit review process for applications, with the objective of selecting recipients most likely to be successful in delivering results based on the program objectives outlined in section ยง 200.202. A merit review is an objective process of evaluating Federal award applications in accordance with written standards set forth by the Federal awarding agency. This process must be described or incorporated by reference in the applicable funding opportunity (see appendix I to this part.). See also ยง 200.204. The Federal awarding agency must also periodically review its merit review process.
