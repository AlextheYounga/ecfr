##### ยง 200.336 Methods for collection, transmission, and storage of information. #####

The Federal awarding agency and the non-Federal entity should, whenever practicable, collect, transmit, and store Federal award-related information in open and machine-readable formats rather than in closed formats or on paper in accordance with applicable legislative requirements. A machine-readable format is a format in a standard computer language (not English text) that can be read automatically by a web browser or computer system. The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must always provide or accept paper versions of Federal award-related information to and from the non-Federal entity upon request. If paper copies are submitted, the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity must not require more than an original and two copies. When original records are electronic and cannot be altered, there is no need to create and retain paper copies. When original records are paper, electronic versions may be substituted through the use of duplication or other forms of electronic media provided that they are subject to periodic quality control reviews, provide reasonable safeguards against alteration, and remain readable.
