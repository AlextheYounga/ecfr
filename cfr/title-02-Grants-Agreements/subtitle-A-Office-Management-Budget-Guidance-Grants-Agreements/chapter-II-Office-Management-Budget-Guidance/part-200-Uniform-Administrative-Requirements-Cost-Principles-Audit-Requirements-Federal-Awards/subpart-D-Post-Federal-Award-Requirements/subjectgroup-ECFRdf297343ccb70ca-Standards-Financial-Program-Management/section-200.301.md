##### ยง 200.301 Performance measurement. #####

The Federal awarding agency must require the recipient to use OMB-approved standard information collections when providing financial and performance information. As appropriate and in accordance with above mentioned information collections, the Federal awarding agency must require the recipient to relate financial data to performance accomplishments of the Federal award. Also, in accordance with above mentioned standard information collections, and when applicable, recipients must also provide cost information to demonstrate cost effective practices (e.g., through unit cost data). The recipient's performance should be measured in a way that will help the Federal awarding agency and other non-Federal entities to improve program outcomes, share lessons learned, and spread the adoption of promising practices. The Federal awarding agency should provide recipients with clear performance goals, indicators, and milestones as described in ยง 200.210 Information contained in a Federal award. Performance reporting frequency and content should be established to not only allow the Federal awarding agency to understand the recipient progress but also to facilitate identification of promising practices among recipients and build the evidence upon which the Federal awarding agency's program and performance decisions are made.
