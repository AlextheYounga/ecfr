Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 56458, Sept. 11, 2020.

(a) The Director may prohibit the introduction into the United States of persons from designated foreign countries (or one or more political subdivisions and regions thereof) or places, only for such period of time that the Director deems necessary for the public health, by issuing an order in which the Director determines that:

(1) By reason of the existence of any communicable disease in a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or place there is serious danger of the introduction of such communicable disease into the United States; and

(2) This danger is so increased by the introduction of persons from such country (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or place that a suspension of the introduction of such persons into the United States is required in the interest of the public health.

(b) For purposes of this section:

(1) *Introduction into the United States* of persons from a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or place means the movement of a person from a foreign country (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or place, or series of foreign countries or places, into the United States so as to bring the person into contact with persons in the United States, or so as to cause the contamination of property in the United States, in a manner that the Director determines to present a risk of transmission of a communicable disease to persons or property, even if the communicable disease has already been introduced, transmitted, or is spreading within the United States;

(2) *Serious danger of the introduction of such communicable disease into the United States* means the potential for introduction of vectors of the communicable disease into the United States, even if persons or property in the United States are already infected or contaminated with the communicable disease; and

(3) The term *“Place”* includes any location specified by the Director, including any carrier, as that term is defined in 42 CFR 71.1, whatever the carrier's nationality.

(c) In any order issued under this section, the Director shall designate the foreign countries (or one or more political subdivisions or regions thereof) or places; the period of time or circumstances under which the introduction of any persons or class of persons into the United States shall be suspended; and the conditions under which that prohibition on introduction, in whole or in part, shall be effective, including any relevant exceptions that the Director determines are appropriate.

(d) Before issuing any order under this section, the Director may coordinate with State and local authorities and other Federal departments or agencies as he deems appropriate in his discretion.

(1) If the order will be implemented in whole or in part by State and local authorities who have agreed to do so under 42 U.S.C. 243(a), then the Director may explain in the order the procedures and standards by which those authorities are expected to aid in the enforcement of the order.

(2) If the order will be implemented in whole or in part by designated customs officers (including officers of the Department of Homeland Security with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, who exercise the authorities of customs officers) or Coast Guard officers under 42 U.S.C. 268(b), or another Federal department or agency, then the Director shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Homeland Security or other applicable Federal department or agency head, explain in the order the procedures and standards by which any authorities or officers or agents are expected to aid in the enforcement of the order, to the extent that they are permitted to do so under their existing legal authorities.

(e) This section does not apply to members of the armed forces of the United States and associated personnel for whom the Secretary of Defense provides assurance to the Director that the Secretary of Defense, through measures such as quarantine, isolation, or other measures maintaining control over such individuals, is preventing the risk of transmission of a communicable disease into the United States.

(f) This section shall not apply to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.
