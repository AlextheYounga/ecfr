Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 27969, June 17, 2019.

(a) Non-commissioned officers and other employees of the Service shall not receive any additional compensation by reason of being assigned to any duty requiring intimate contact with persons with Hansen's disease. However, any such officer or employee who was entitled, on January 4, 1986, to receive additional pay by reason of being assigned to full-time duty, for a period of 30 days or more, at a station of the Service devoted to the care of Hansen's disease patients and who continues to be assigned to such duty, shall receive special pay as long as such assignment continues without a break.

(b) Such special pay shall, on any future date, be at an annual dollar level equal to the lower of the levels that would be paid under the following subparagraphs:

(1) 25% of the lowest level of basic pay that he or she has been receiving on any date from January 4, 1986, through that future date;

(2) The amount by which the level of an employee's basic pay plus special pay on January 4, 1986, exceeds the level of that employee's basic pay on that on that future date, except that the special pay under this subparagraph shall not be less that 12 times the monthly special pay then paid to Commissioned Officers entitled to special pay for duty involving intimate contact with persons who have Hansen's disease. (As of October 24, 1985, that monthly rate was $110.)

(c) An officer or employee may be paid special pay for any pay period, under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, only to the extent that it does not cause his or her aggregate pay for that pay period to exceed the biweekly rate of basic pay for Level V of the Executive Schedule. As used in this paragraph, “aggregate pay” comprises basic pay, this special pay, and premiums for overtime, nightwork, irregular duty, standby status, and Sunday or holiday work.
