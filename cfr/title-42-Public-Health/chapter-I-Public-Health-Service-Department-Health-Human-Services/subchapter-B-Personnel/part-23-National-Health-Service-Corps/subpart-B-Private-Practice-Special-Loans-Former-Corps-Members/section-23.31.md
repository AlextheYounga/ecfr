##### ยง 23.31 May loan payments be postponed or waived? #####

(a) Whenever health, economic, or other personal problems affect the borrower's ability to make scheduled payments on the loan, the Secretary may allow the borrower an extension of time or allow the borrower to make smaller payments than were previously scheduled; however, interest will continue to accrue at the rate specified in the promissory note until the loan is repaid in full. The loan must be fully repaid within 10 years after it was made.

(b) No waiver, full or partial, of repayment of the loan will be granted; except that the obligation of a borrower to repay a loan shall be cancelled upon the death or total and permanent disability of the borrower, as determined by the Secretary.

(c) In order to make a determination under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary may require supporting medical, financial, or other documentation.
