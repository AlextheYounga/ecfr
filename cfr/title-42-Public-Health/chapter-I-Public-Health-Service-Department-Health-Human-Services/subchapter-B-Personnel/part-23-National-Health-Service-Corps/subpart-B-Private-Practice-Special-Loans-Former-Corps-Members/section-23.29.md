##### ยง 23.29 What happens in the case of a default? #####

(a) In the event of default, the Secretary may declare the entire amount owed (including principal, accrued interest and any applicable charges) immediately due and payable. Collection of the amount owed will be made in accordance with 45 CFR part 30.

(b) The borrower is not entitled to written notice of any default and the failure to deliver written notice of default in no way affects the Secretary's right to declare the loan in default and take any appropriate action under the loan agreement or the promissory note.

(c) The failure of the Secretary to exercise any remedy available under law or regulation shall in no event be construed as a waiver of his or her right to exercise that remedy if any subsequent or continued default or breach occurs.
