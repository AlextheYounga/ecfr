##### § 24.6 Pay and compensation. #####

The SBRS is an ungraded system, with a single, flexible pay range to include all members.

(a) Pay of the members of the Service shall be determined by the Secretary or his/her designee.

(b) The pay of a member of the Service shall be not less than the minimum rate payable for GS-15 of the General Schedule and shall not exceed:

(1) The rate payable for level I of the Executive Schedule unless a higher rate of pay is expressly approved on an individual basis by the President, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5377(d)(2), or

(2) The rate payable for level II of the Executive Schedule unless a higher rate of pay is expressly approved on an individual basis by the Secretary.

(c) While the full pay range will be used, individual pay at the higher end of the range will be used only as needed to recognize individual scientific value and as necessary to recruit or retain an exceptionally well-qualified scientist.

(d) The following factors will be used in establishing appropriate pay rates for individual members:

(1) Impact of the individual on the scientific field;

(2) Recognition of the individual by the scientific community;

(3) Originality of the individual's ideas/work products;

(4) Specific “clinical” or highly technical skills of the individual which are of benefit to the agency and which are in addition to requirements of the basic scientific assignment;

(5) The individual's earnings and monetary benefits;

(6) Salary surveys of similar skills in pertinent labor markets; and

(7) Other relevant factors.

(e) Annual adjustments to pay rates may be made effective on the first day of the first pay period on or after January 1 of each calendar year. The rate of such adjustments will be at the discretion of the Secretary or his/her designee, except that the minimum rate payable in the SBRS will be increased to the amount of the minimum rate of the GS-15 of the General Schedule.

(f) Other pay adjustments will be made on an individual basis by the Secretary or his/her designee.

(g) Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, new appointees to the Service, who are not covered by the Civil Service Retirement System, will be covered by the Federal Employees Retirement System.

(h) Upon the request of a member who performed service in the employ of an institution of higher education immediately prior to his appointment as a member of the Service, and retains the right to make contributions to the retirement system of such institution, the Department of Health and Human Services may contribute an amount not to exceed ten percent per annum of the member's basic pay to such institution's retirement system on behalf of such member. A member who participates in this program shall not be covered by any retirement system established for employees of the United States under title 5, United States Code.
