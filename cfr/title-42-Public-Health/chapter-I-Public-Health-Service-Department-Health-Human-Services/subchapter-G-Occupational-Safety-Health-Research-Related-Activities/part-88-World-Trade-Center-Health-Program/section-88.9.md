##### ยง 88.9 Application process - status as a WTC survivor. #####

(a) *Application for status as a screening-eligible survivor.* An application to the WTC Health Program based on the criteria in ยง 88.8(a) shall be submitted with documentation of the applicant's location, presence or residence, and/or work activity during the relevant time period.

(1) Documentation may include but is not limited to: Proof of residence, such as a lease or utility bill; attendance roster at a school or daycare; or pay stub, other employment documentation, or written statement, under penalty of perjury, by an employer indicating employment location during the relevant time period, or similar documentation. The applicant shall also attest to symptoms of a WTC-related health condition.

(2) An applicant who is unable to submit the required documentation must instead offer a written explanation of how he or she tried to obtain proof of location, presence, or residence, and/or work activity and why the attempt was unsuccessful. The applicant shall attest, under penalty of perjury, that he or she meets the criteria specified in ยง 88.8.

(b) *Status as a certified-eligible survivor.* No additional application is required for status as a certified-eligible survivor. If, based upon the screening-eligible survivor's initial health evaluation (*see* ยง 88.10(e)), the WTC Program Administrator certifies the diagnosis of a WTC-related health condition, then the survivor will also obtain status as a certified-eligible survivor.
