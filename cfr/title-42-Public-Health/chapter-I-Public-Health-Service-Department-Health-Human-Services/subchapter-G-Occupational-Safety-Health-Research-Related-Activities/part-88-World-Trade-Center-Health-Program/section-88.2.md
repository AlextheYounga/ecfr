(a) Designated representative. (1) An applicant, enrolled responder, screening-eligible survivor, or certified-eligible survivor may appoint one individual to represent his or her interests under the WTC Health Program. The appointment must be in writing.

(2) There may be only one representative at any time. After one representative has been properly appointed, the WTC Health Program will not recognize another individual as a representative until the appointment of the first designated representative is withdrawn.

Any notice requirement contained in this part or in the Act is fully satisfied if sent to the designated representative.

(4) An enrolled responder, screening-eligible survivor, or certified-eligible survivor may authorize any individual to represent him or her in regard to the WTC Health Program, unless that individual's service as a representative would violate any applicable provision of law (such as 18 U.S.C. 205 and 208).

(5) A Federal employee may act as a representative only on behalf of the individuals specified in, and in the manner permitted by, 18 U.S.C. 203 and 18 U.S.C. 205.

(6) If a screening-eligible or certified-eligible survivor is a minor, a parent or guardian may act on his or her behalf.
