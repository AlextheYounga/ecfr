##### ยง 88.17 Addition of health conditions to the list of WTC-related health conditions. #####

(a) Any interested party may petition the WTC Program Administrator to add a condition to the list of WTC-related health conditions.

(1) Each petition shall state an intent to petition and be sent to the WTC Program Administrator. The petition shall include:

(i) Name and contact information of the interested party;

(ii) Name and description of the condition(s) to be added; and

(iii) Reasons for adding the condition(s), including the medical basis for the association between the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the condition(s) to be added.

(2) Not later than 60 days after the receipt of a petition, the WTC Program Administrator shall:

(i) Request a recommendation of the WTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee; or

(ii) Publish in the Federal Register a proposed rule to add such health condition; or

(iii) Publish in the Federal Register the WTC Program Administrator's determination not to publish a proposed rule and the basis for that determination; or

(iv) Publish in the Federal Register a determination that insufficient evidence exists to take action under paragraph (a)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section.

(3) The WTC Program Administrator may consider more than one petition simultaneously when the petitions propose the addition of the same health condition. Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee recommendations and Federal Register notices initiated by the WTC Program Administrator pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may respond to more than one petition.

(4) The WTC Program Administrator shall be required to consider a new petition for a health condition previously reviewed by the WTC Program Administrator and determined not to qualify for addition to the list of WTC-related health conditions only if the new petition presents a new medical basis (i.e., not previously reviewed) for the association between the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the condition to be added.

(b) The WTC Program Administrator may propose to add a condition to the list of WTC-related health conditions by publishing a proposed rule in the Federal Register and providing interested parties a period of 30 days to submit written comments. The WTC Program Administrator may extend the comment period for good cause.

(1) If the WTC Program Administrator requests a recommendation from the WTC Health Program Scientific/Technical Advisory Committee, the Advisory Committee shall submit its recommendation to the WTC Program Administrator no later than 60 days after the date of the transmission of the request or no later than a date specified by the Administrator (but not more than 180 days after the request). If the WTC Program Administrator decides to publish a proposed rule or a determination not to publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register, he or she shall do so no later than 60 days after the date of transmission of the Advisory Committee recommendation.

(2) [Reserved]
