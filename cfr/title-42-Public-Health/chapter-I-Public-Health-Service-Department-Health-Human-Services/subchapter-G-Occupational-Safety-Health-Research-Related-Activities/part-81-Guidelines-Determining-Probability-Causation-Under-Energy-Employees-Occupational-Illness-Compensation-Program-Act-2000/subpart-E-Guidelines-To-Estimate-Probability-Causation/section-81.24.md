##### § 81.24 Guidelines for leukemia. #####

(a) For claims involving leukemia, DOL will calculate one or more probability of causation estimates from up to three of the four alternate leukemia risk models included in NIOSH-IREP, as specified in the NIOSH-IREP Operating Guide. These include: “Leukemia, all types except CLL” (IDC-9 codes: 204-208, except 204.1), “acute lymphocytic leukemia” (ICD-9 code: 204.0), and “acute myelogenous leukemia” (ICD-9 code: 205.0).

(b) For leukemia claims in which DOL calculates multiple probability of causation estimates, as specified in the NIOSH-IREP Operating Guide, the probability of causation estimate DOL assigns to the claim will be based on the leukemia risk model producing the highest estimate for probability of causation.
