##### § 81.23 Guidelines for cancers for which primary site is unknown. #####

(a) In claims for which the primary cancer site cannot be determined, but a site of metastasis is known, DOL will calculate probability of causation estimates for various likely primary sites. Table 1 of this paragraph (a) indicates the primary cancer site(s) DOL will use in NIOSH-IREP when the primary cancer site is unknown.

Table 1 to Paragraph (a)Primary cancers (ICD-10-CM codes) for which probability of causation is to be calculated, if only a secondary cancer site is known. “M” indicates cancer site should be used for males only, and “F” indicates the cancer site should be used for females only.
