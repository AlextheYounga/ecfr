##### § 84.180 Airflow resistance tests. #####

(a) Resistance to airflow will be measured in the facepiece, mouthpiece, hood, or helmet of a particulate respirator (complete respirator) mounted on a test fixture with air flowing at continuous rate of 85 ±2 liters per minute, before each test conducted in accordance with § 84.182.

(b) The resistances for particulate respirators upon initial inhalation shall not exceed 35 mm water column height pressure and upon initial exhalation shall not exceed 25 mm water column height pressure.
