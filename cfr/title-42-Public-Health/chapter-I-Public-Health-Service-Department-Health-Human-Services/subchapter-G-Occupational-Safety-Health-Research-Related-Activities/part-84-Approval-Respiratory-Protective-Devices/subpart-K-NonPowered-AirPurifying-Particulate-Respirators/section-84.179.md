(a) The respirator manufacturer, as part of the application for certification, shall specify the filter series and the filter efficiency level (i.e., “N95”, “R95, “P95”, “N99, “R99”, “P99”, “N100”, “R100”, or “P100”) for which certification is being sought.

(b) Filters shall be prominently labeled as follows:

(1) N100 filters shall be labeled “N100 Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)” and shall be a color other than magenta.

(2) R100 filters shall be labeled “R100 Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)” and shall be a color other than magenta.

(3) P100 filters shall be labeled “P100 Particulate Filter (99.97% filter efficiency level)” and shall be color coded magenta.

(4) N99 filters shall be labeled “N99 Particulate Filter (99% filter efficiency level)” and shall be a color other than magenta.

(5) R99 filters shall be labeled “R99 Particulate Filter (99% filter efficiency level)” and shall be a color other than magenta.

(6) P99 filters shall be labeled “P99 Particulate Filter (99% filter efficiency level)” and shall be a color other than magenta.

(7) N95 filters shall be labeled as “N95 Particulate Filter (95% filter efficiency level)” and shall be a color other than magenta.

(8) R95 filters shall be labeled as “R95 Particulate Filter (95% filter efficiency level)” and shall be a color other than magenta.

(9) P95 filters shall be labeled as “P95 Particulate Filter (95% filter efficiency level)” and shall be a color other than magenta.
