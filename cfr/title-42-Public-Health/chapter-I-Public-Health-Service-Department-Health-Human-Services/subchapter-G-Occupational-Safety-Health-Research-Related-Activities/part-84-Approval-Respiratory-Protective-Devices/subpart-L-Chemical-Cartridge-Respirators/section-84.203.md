##### § 84.203 Breathing resistance test; minimum requirements. #####

(a) Resistance to airflow will be measured in the facepiece, mouthpiece, hood, or helmet of a chemical cartridge respirator mounted on a test fixture with air flowing at a continuous rate of 85 liters per minute, both before and after each test conducted in accordance with §§ 84.206 through 84.207.

(b) The maximum allowable resistance requirements for chemical cartridge respirators are as follows:
