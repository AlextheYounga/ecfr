(b) Chemical cartridge respirators for respiratory protection against gases or vapors, which are not specifically listed with their maximum use concentration, may be approved if the applicant submits a request for such approval, in writing, to the Institute. The Institute shall consider each such application and accept or reject the application after a review of the effects on the wearer's health and safety and in the light of any field experience in use of chemical cartridge respirators as protection against such hazards.
