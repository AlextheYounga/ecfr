##### ยง 84.1151 DOP filter test; respirators designed as respiratory protection against dusts, fumes, and mists having an air contamination level less than 0.05 milligram per cubic meter and against radionuclides; minimum requirements. #####

(a) All single air-purifying respirator filter units will be tested in an atmosphere concentration of 100 micrograms of DOP per liter of air at continuous flow rates of 32 and 85 liters per minute for a period of 5 to 10 seconds.

(b) Where filters are to be used in pairs, the flow rates will be 16 and 42.5 liters per minute, respectively, through each filter.

(c) The filter will be mounted on a connector in the same manner as used on the respirator, and the total leakage for the connector and filter shall not exceed 0.03 percent of the ambient DOP concentration at either flow rate.
