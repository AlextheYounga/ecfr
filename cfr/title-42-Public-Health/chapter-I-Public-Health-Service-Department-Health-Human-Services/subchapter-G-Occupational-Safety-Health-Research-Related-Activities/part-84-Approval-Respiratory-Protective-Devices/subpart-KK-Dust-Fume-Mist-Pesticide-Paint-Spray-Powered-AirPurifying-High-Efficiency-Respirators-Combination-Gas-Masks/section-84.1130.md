##### ยง 84.1130 Respirators; description. #####

(a) Dust, fume, and mist respirators, including all completely assembled respirators designed for use as respiratory protection during entry into and escape from atmospheres which contain adequate oxygen to support life and hazardous particulates, are described as follows:

(1) Air-purifying respirators, either with replaceable or reusable filters, designed as respiratory protection against dusts:

(i) Having an air contamination level not less than 0.05 milligram per cubic meter of air, including but not limited to coal, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, and manganese; or

(ii) Having an air contamination level not less than 2 million particles per cubic foot of air, including but not limited to aluminum, flour, iron ore, and free silica, resulting principally from the disintegration of a solid, e.g., dust clouds produced in mining, quarrying, and tunneling, and in dusts produced during industrial operations, such as grinding, crushing, and the general processing of minerals and other materials.

(2) Air-purifying respirators, with replaceable filters, designed as respiratory protection against fumes of various metals having an air contamination level not less than 0.05 milligram per cubic meter, including but not limited to aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, mercury (except mercury vapor), and zinc, which result from the sublimation or condensation of their respective vapors, or from the chemical reaction between their respective vapors and gases.

(3) Air-purifying respirators, with replaceable filters, designed as respiratory protection against mists of materials having an air contamination level not less than 0.05 milligram per cubic meter or 2 million particles per cubic foot, e.g., mists produced by spray coating with vitreous enamels, chromic acid mist produced during chromium plating, and other mists of materials whose liquid vehicle does not produce harmful gases or vapors.

(4) Air-purifying respirators, with replaceable filters, designed as respiratory protection against dusts, fumes, and mists having an air contamination level less than 0.05 milligram per cubic meter, including but not limited to lithium hydride and beryllium, and against radionuclides.

(5) Air-purifying respirators, with replaceable filters, designed as respiratory protection against radon daughters, and radon daughters attached to dusts, fumes, and mists.

(6) Air-purifying respirators, with replaceable filters, designed as respiratory protection against asbestos-containing dusts and mists.

(7) Air-purifying respirators, with replaceable filters, designed as protection against various combinations of particulate matter.

(8) Air-purifying dust respirators designed as respiratory protection against pneumoconiosis- and fibrosis-producing dusts, or dusts and mists, including but not limited to aluminum, asbestos, coal, flour, iron ore, and free silica.

(b) Gas masks containing filters for protection against dusts, fumes, mists, and smokes in combination with gases, vapors, or gases and vapors. These respirators are not for use against gases or vapors with poor warning properties (except where MSHA or Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards may permit such use for a specific gas or vapor) or those which generate high heats of reaction with sorbent material in the canister.

(c) Pesticide respirators, including all completely assembled respirators which are designed for use as respiratory protection during entry into and escape from atmospheres which contain pesticide hazards, are described according to their construction as follows:

(1) Front-mounted or back-mounted gas masks;

(2) Chin-style gas mask;

(3) Chemical cartridge;

(4) Air-purifying respirator with attached blower; and,

(5) Other devices, including combination respirators.

(d) Respirators with cartridges containing or having attached to them, filters for protection against mists of paints, lacquers, and enamels. These respirators are not for use against gases or vapors with poor warning properties (except where MSHA or Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards may permit such use for a specific gas or vapor) or those which generate high heats of reaction with sorbent material in the cartridge.

(e) Respirators with cartridges containing or having attached to them filters for protection against dusts, fumes, and mists, except the mists of paints, lacquers, and enamels. These respirators are not for use against gases or vapors with poor warning properties (except where MSHA or Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards may permit such use for a specific gas or vapor) or those which generate high heats of reaction with sorbent material in the cartridge.
