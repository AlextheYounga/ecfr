|       For gases, vapors, or gases and vapors, and dusts, fumes, and mists        |       50        |    70    |20 |
|For gases, vapors, or gases and vapors, and mists of paints, lacquers, and enamels|       50        |    70    |20 |

<sup>1</sup> Measured at end of service life specified in Table 11 in subpart L of this part.

(b) *Facepiece test.* The facepiece test will be conducted as specified in § 84.205.

(c) *Lacquer and enamel mist tests; general.* (1) Three respirators with cartridges containing or having attached to them, filters for protection against mists of paints, lacquers, and enamels shall be tested in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of this section.

(2) In addition to the test requirements set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, three such respirators will be tested against each aerosol in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

(d) *Lacquer mist test.* (1) Temperature in the test chamber will be approximately 25 °C.

(2) Continuous airflow through the respirator will be 32 liters per minute for air-purifying respirators, and not less than 115 liters per minute to tight fitting facepieces and 170 liters per minute to loose-fitting hoods and helmets of powered air-purifying respirators.

(3) Airflow through the chamber will be 20-25 air changes per minute.

(4) The atomizer employed will be a No. 64-5 nozzle with setup 3, or equivalent, operating at 69 kN/m.2 (10 pounds per square inch gage).

(5) The test aerosol will be prepared by atomizing a mixture of one volume of clear cellulose nitrate lacquer and one volume of lacquer thinner. The lacquer described in Federal Specification TT-L-31, October 7, 1953, is an example of an acceptable lacquer. Copies of TT-L-31 may be inspected or obtained from the NIOSH, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, P.O. Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236.

(6) The concentration of cellulose nitrate in the test aerosol will be 95-125 milligrams per cubic meter.

(7) The test aerosol will be drawn to each respirator for a total of 156 minutes for air-purifying respirators and 240 minutes for powered air-purifying respirators.

(8) The total amount of unretained mist in the samples taken during testing, weighed as cellulose nitrate, shall not exceed 5 milligrams for an air-purifying respirator, 28 milligrams for a powered air-purifying respirator with tight-fitting facepiece, and 41 milligrams for a powered air-purifying respirator with loose-fitting hood or helmet.

(e) *Enamel mist test.* (1) Temperature in the test chamber will be approximately 25 °C.

(2) Continuous airflow through the respirator will be 32 liters per minute for air-purifying respirators, and not less than 115 liters per minute to tight-fitting facepieces and 170 liters per minute to loose-fitting hoods and helmets of powered air-purifying respirators.

(3) Airflow through the chamber will be 20-25 air changes per minute.

(4) The atomizer employed will be a No. 64 nozzle with setup 1A, or equivalent, operating at 69 kN/m.2 (10 pounds per square inch gage).

(5) The test aerosol will be prepared by atomizing a mixture of 1 volume of white enamel and 1 volume of turpentine. The enamel described in Federal Specification TT-E-489b, May 12, 1953, with amendment-1 of 9 November 1955 is an example of an acceptable enamel. Copies of TT-E-489b may be inspected or obtained from the NIOSH, National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory, P.O. Box 18070, 626 Cochrans Mill Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15236.

(6) The concentration of pigment in the test aerosol, weighed as ash, will be 95-125 milligrams per cubic meter.

(7) The test aerosol will be drawn to each respirator for a total of 156 minutes for air-purifying respirators and 240 minutes for power air-purifying respirators.

(8) The total amount of unretained mist in the samples taken during testing, weighed as ash, shall not exceed 1.5 milligrams for any air-purifying respirator, 8.3 milligrams for a powered air-purifying respirator with tight-fitting facepiece, and 12.3 milligrams for a powered air-purifying respirator with loose-fitting hood or helmet.

(f) *Bench tests; gas and vapor tests.* (1) Bench tests will be made in accordance with § 84.207 and tested cartridges shall meet the minimum requirements set forth in Table 11 of subpart L of this part. Cartridges will be equilibrated in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

(2)(i) Two powered air-purifying cartridges or pairs of cartridges will be equilibrated at room temperature by passing 25 percent relative humidity air through them at the following flow rates (expressed in liters per minute (l.p.m.)) for 6 hours:

|                   Type of cartridge                   |Airflow rate,  <br/>l.p.m.|
|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
|  Powered air purifying with tight-fitting facepiece   |           115            |
|Powered air purifying with loose-fitting hood or helmet|           170            |

(ii) Two powered air-purifying cartridges or pairs of cartridges will be equilibrated by passing 85 percent relative humidity air through them at the flow rates stated in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section.

(iii) All cartridges will be resealed, kept in an upright position, at room temperatures, and tested within 18 hours.
