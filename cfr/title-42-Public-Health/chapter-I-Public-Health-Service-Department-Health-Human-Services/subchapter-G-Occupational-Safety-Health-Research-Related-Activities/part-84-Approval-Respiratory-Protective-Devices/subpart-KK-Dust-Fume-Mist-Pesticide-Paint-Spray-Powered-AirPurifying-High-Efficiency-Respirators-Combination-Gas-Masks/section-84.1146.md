##### § 84.1146 Lead fume test for dust, fume, and mist respirators; minimum requirements. #####

(a) Three non-powered respirators will be tested for a period of 312 minutes each at a continuous airflow rate of 32 liters per minute.

(b) The relative humidity in the test chamber will be 20-80 percent, and the room temperature approximately 25 °C.

(c) The test suspension in the test chamber will not be less than 15 nor more than 20 milligrams of freshly generated lead-oxide fume, calculated as lead (Pb), per cubic meter of air.

(d) The fume will be generated by impinging an oxygen-gas flame on molten lead.

(e) Samples of the test suspension will be taken during each test period for analysis.

(f) The total amount of unretained test suspension in the samples taken during testing, which is analyzed and calculated as lead (Pb), shall not exceed 1.5 milligrams of lead for a non-powered air-purifying respirator.
