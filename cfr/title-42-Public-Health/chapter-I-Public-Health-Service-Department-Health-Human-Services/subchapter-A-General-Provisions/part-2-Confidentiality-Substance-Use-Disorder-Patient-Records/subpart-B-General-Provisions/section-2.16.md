(iv) Using and accessing workstations, secure rooms, locked file cabinets, safes, or other similar containers, and storage facilities that use or store such information; and

(v) Rendering patient identifying information non-identifiable in a manner that creates a very low risk of re-identification (*e.g.,* removing direct identifiers).

(2) Electronic records, including:

(i) Creating, receiving, maintaining, and transmitting such records;

(ii) Destroying such records, including sanitizing the electronic media on which such records are stored, to render the patient identifying information non-retrievable;
