##### § 2.32 Prohibition on re-disclosure. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 251, Jan. 3, 2018.

(a) *Notice to accompany disclosure.* Each disclosure made with the patient's written consent must be accompanied by the following written statement: This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by federal confidentiality rules (*42 CFR part 2*). The federal rules prohibit you from making any further disclosure of information in this record that identifies a patient as having or having had a substance use disorder either directly, by reference to publicly available information, or through verification of such identification by another person unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent of the individual whose information is being disclosed or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other information is *NOT* sufficient for this purpose (see § 2.31). The federal rules restrict any use of the information to investigate or prosecute with regard to a crime any patient with a substance use disorder, except as provided at §§ 2.12(c)(5) and 2.65.

(b) [Reserved]
