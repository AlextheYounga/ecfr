##### ยง 8.14 Suspension or revocation of certification. #####

(a) *Revocation.* Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, SAMHSA may revoke the certification of an OTP if SAMHSA finds, after providing the program sponsor with notice and an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subpart C of this part, that the program sponsor, or any employee of the OTP:

(1) Has been found guilty of misrepresentation in obtaining the certification;

(2) Has failed to comply with the Federal opioid treatment standards in any respect;

(3) Has failed to comply with reasonable requests from SAMHSA or from an accreditation body for records, information, reports, or materials that are necessary to determine the continued eligibility of the OTP for certification or continued compliance with the Federal opioid treatment standards; or

(4) Has refused a reasonable request of a duly designated SAMHSA inspector, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Inspector, State Inspector, or accreditation body representative for permission to inspect the program or the program's operations or its records.

(b) *Suspension.* Whenever SAMHSA has reason to believe that revocation may be required and that immediate action is necessary to protect public health or safety, SAMHSA may immediately suspend the certification of an OTP before holding a hearing under subpart C of this part. SAMHSA may immediately suspend as well as propose revocation of the certification of an OTP before holding a hearing under subpart C of this part if SAMHSA makes a finding described in paragraph (a) of this section and also determines that:

(1) The failure to comply with the Federal opioid treatment standards presents an imminent danger to the public health or safety;

(2) The refusal to permit inspection makes immediate suspension necessary; or

(3) There is reason to believe that the failure to comply with the Federal opioid treatment standards was intentional or was associated with fraud.

(c) *Written notification.* In the event that SAMHSA suspends the certification of an OTP in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section or proposes to revoke the certification of an OTP in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, SAMHSA shall promptly provide the sponsor of the OTP with written notice of the suspension or proposed revocation by facsimile transmission, personal service, commercial overnight delivery service, or certified mail, return receipt requested. Such notice shall state the reasons for the action and shall state that the OTP may seek review of the action in accordance with the procedures in subpart C of this part.

(d)(1) If SAMHSA suspends certification in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section:

(i) SAMHSA will immediately notify DEA that the OTP's registration should be suspended under 21 U.S.C. 824(d); and

(ii) SAMHSA will provide an opportunity for a hearing under subpart C of this part.

(2) Suspension of certification under paragraph (b) of this section shall remain in effect until the agency determines that:

(i) The basis for the suspension cannot be substantiated;

(ii) Violations of required standards have been corrected to the agency's satisfaction; or

(iii) The OTP's certification shall be revoked.
