##### § 2.21 Relationship to Federal statutes protecting research subjects against compulsory disclosure of their identity. #####

(a) *Research privilege description.* There may be concurrent coverage of patient identifying information by these regulations and by administrative action taken under: Section 303(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242a(a) and the implementing regulations at 42 CFR part 2a); or section 502(c) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 872(c) and the implementing regulations at 21 CFR 1316.21). These “research privilege” statutes confer on the Secretary of Health and Human Services and on the Attorney General, respectively, the power to authorize researchers conducting certain types of research to withhold from all persons not connected with the research the names and other identifying information concerning individuals who are the subjects of the research.

(b) *Effect of concurrent coverage.* These regulations restrict the disclosure and use of information about patients, while administrative action taken under the research privilege statutes and implementing regulations protects a person engaged in applicable research from being compelled to disclose any identifying characteristics of the individuals who are the subjects of that research. The issuance under subpart E of these regulations of a court order authorizing a disclosure of information about a patient does not affect an exercise of authority under these research privilege statutes. However, the research privilage granted under 21 CFR 291.505(g) to treatment programs using methadone for maintenance treatment does not protect from compulsory disclosure any imformation which is permitted to be disclosed under those regulations. Thus, if a court order entered in accordance with subpart E of these regulations authorizes a methadone maintenance treatment program to disclose certain information about its patients, that program may not invoke the research privilege under 21 CFR 291.505(g) as a defense to a subpoena for that information.
