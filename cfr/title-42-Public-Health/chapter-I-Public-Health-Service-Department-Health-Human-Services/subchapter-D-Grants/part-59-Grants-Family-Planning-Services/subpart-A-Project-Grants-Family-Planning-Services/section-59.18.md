##### ยง 59.18 Appropriate use of funds. #####

(a) Title X funds shall not be used to build infrastructure for purposes prohibited with these funds, such as support for the abortion business of a Title X grantee or subrecipient. Funds shall only be used for the purposes, and in direct implementation of, the funded project, expressly permitted by this regulation and authorized within section 1001 of the Public Health Service Act, that is, to offer family planning methods and services. Grantees must use the majority of grant funds to provide direct services to clients, and each grantee shall provide a detailed plan or accounting for the use of grant dollars, both in their applications for funding, and in any annually required reporting. Any significant change in the use of grant funds within the grant cycle shall not be undertaken without the approval of the Office of Population Affairs.

(b) Title X funds shall not be expended for any activity (including the publication or distribution of literature) that in any way tends to promote public support or opposition to any legislative proposal or candidate for office.

(c) Each project supported under Title X shall fully account for, and justify, charges against the Title X grant. The Department shall put additional protections in place to prevent possible misuse of Title X funds through misbilling or overbilling, or any other unallowable expense.
