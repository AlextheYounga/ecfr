##### § 60.31 The application to be a HEAL lender or holder. #####

(a) In order to be a HEAL lender or holder, an eligible organization must submit an application to the Secretary annually.

(b) In determining whether to enter into an insurance contract with an applicant and what the terms of that contract should be, the Secretary may consider the following criteria:

(1) Whether the applicant is capable of complying with the requirements in the HEAL regulations applicable to lenders and holders;

(2) The amount and rate of loans which are currently delinquent or in default, if the applicant has had prior experience with similar Federal or State student loan programs; and

(3) The financial resources of the applicant.

(c) The applicant must develop and follow written procedures for making, servicing and collecting HEAL loans. These procedures must be reviewed during the biennial audit required by § 60.42(d). If the applicant uses procedures more stringent than those required by §§ 60.34 and 60.35 for its other loans of comparable dollar value, on which it has no Federal, State, or other third party guarantee, it must include those more stringent procedures in its written procedures for servicing and collecting its HEAL loans.

(d) The applicant must submit sufficient materials with his or her application to enable the Secretary to fairly evaluate the application in accordance with these criteria.
