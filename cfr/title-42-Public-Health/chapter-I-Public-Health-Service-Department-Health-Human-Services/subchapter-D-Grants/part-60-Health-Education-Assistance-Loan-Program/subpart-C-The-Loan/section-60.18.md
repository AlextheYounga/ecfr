##### ยง 60.18 Consolidation of HEAL loans. #####

HEAL loans may be consolidated as follows provided that the lender or holder must first inform the borrower of the effect of the consolidation on the interest rate and explain to the borrower that he or she is not required to agree to the consolidation:

(a) If a lender or holder holds two or more HEAL loans made to the same borrower, the lender or holder and the borrower may agree to consolidate the loans into a single HEAL loan obligation evidenced by one promissory note.

(b) A HEAL loan may be consolidated with any other loan only if:

(1) The consolidation will not result in terms less favorable to the borrower than if no consolidation had occurred, and

(2) The Federal Government does not, as a result of the consolidation, become liable for any payment of principal or interest for a Guaranteed Student Loan under the provisions of section 439(o) of the Higher Education Act of 1965.
