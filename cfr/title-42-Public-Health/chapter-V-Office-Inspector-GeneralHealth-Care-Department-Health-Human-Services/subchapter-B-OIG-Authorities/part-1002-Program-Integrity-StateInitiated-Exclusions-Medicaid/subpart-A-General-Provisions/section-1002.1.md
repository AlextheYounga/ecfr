##### ยง 1002.1 Scope and purpose. #####

The regulations in this part specify certain bases upon which individuals and entities may, or in some cases must, be excluded from participation in the Medicaid program. These regulations specifically address the authority of State agencies to exclude on their own initiative, regardless of whether the OIG has excluded an individual or entity under part 1001 of this chapter. These regulations also delineate the States' obligation to inform the OIG of certain Medicaid-related convictions.
