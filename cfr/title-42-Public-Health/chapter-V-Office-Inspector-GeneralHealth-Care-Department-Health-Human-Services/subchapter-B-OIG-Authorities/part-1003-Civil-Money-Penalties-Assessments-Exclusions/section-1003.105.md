Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 88355, Dec. 7, 2016.

(a)(1) Except as set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the following persons may be subject, in lieu of or in addition to any penalty or assessment, to an exclusion from participation in Medicare for a period of time determined under § 1003.107. There will be exclusions from Federal health care programs for the same period as the Medicare exclusion for any person who -

(i) Is subject to a penalty or assessment under § 1003.102(a), (b)(1), (b)(4), (b)(12), (b)(13) or (b)(15); or

(ii) Commits a gross and flagrant, or repeated, violation of section 1867 of the Act or § 489.24 of this title on or after May 1, 1991. For purposes of this section, a gross and flagrant violation is one that presents an imminent danger to the health, safety or well-being of the individual who seeks emergency examination and treatment or places that individual unnecessarily in a high-risk situation.

(b)(1)(i) With respect to any exclusion based on liability for a penalty or assessment under § 1003.102 (a), (b)(1), or (b)(4), the OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the person is the sole community physician or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community. With respect to any exclusion imposed under § 1003.105(a)(1)(ii), the OIG will consider an application from a State agency for a waiver if the physician's exclusion from the State health care program would deny beneficiaries access to medical care or would otherwise cause hardship to beneficiaries.

(ii) If a waiver is granted, it is applicable only to the State health care program for which the State requested the waiver.

(iii) If the OIG subsequently obtains information that the basis for a waiver no longer exists, or the State agency submits evidence that the basis for the waiver no longer exists, the waiver will cease and the person will be excluded from the State health care program for the remainder of the period that the person is excluded from Medicare.

(iv) The OIG notifies the State agency whether its request for a waiver has been granted or denied.

(v) The decision to deny a waiver is not subject to administrative or judicial review.

(2) For purposes of this section, the definitions contained in § 1001.2 of this chapter for “sole community physician” and “sole source of essential specialized services in a community” apply.

(c) When the Inspector General proposes to exclude a nursing facility from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, he or she will, at the same time he or she notifies the respondent, notify the appropriate State licensing authority, the State Office of Aging, the long-term care ombudsman, and the State Medicaid agency of the Inspector General's intention to exclude the facility.
