##### ยง 1003.133 Statistical sampling. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 88355, Dec. 7, 2016.

(a) In meeting the burden of proof set forth in ยง 1005.15, the Inspector General may introduce the results of a statistical sampling study as evidence of the number and amount of claims and/or requests for payment as described in ยง 1003.102 that were presented or caused to be presented by respondent. Such a statistical sampling study, if based upon an appropriate sampling and computed by valid statistical methods, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the number and amount of claims or requests for payment as described in ยง 1003.102.

(b) Once the Inspector General has made a prima facie case as described in paragraph (a) of this section, the burden of production shall shift to respondent to produce evidence reasonably calculated to rebut the findings of the statistical sampling study. The Inspector General will then be given the opportunity to rebut this evidence.
