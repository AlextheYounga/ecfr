As used in subparts A, B, and C, of this part -

*Branch office* means an approved location or site from which a home health agency provides services within a portion of the total geographic area served by the parent agency. The parent home health agency must provide supervision and administrative control of any branch office. It is unnecessary for the branch office to independently meet the conditions of participation as a home health agency.

*Clinical note* means a notation of a contact with a patient that is written, timed, and dated, and which describes signs and symptoms, treatment, drugs administered and the patient's reaction or response, and any changes in physical or emotional condition during a given period of time.

*In advance* means that HHA staff must complete the task prior to performing any hands-on care or any patient education.

*Parent home health agency* means the agency that provides direct support and administrative control of a branch.

*Primary home health agency* means the HHA which accepts the initial referral of a patient, and which provides services directly to the patient or via another health care provider under arrangements (as applicable).

*Proprietary agency* means a private, for-profit agency.

*Public agency* means an agency operated by a state or local government.

*Quality indicator* means a specific, valid, and reliable measure of access, care outcomes, or satisfaction, or a measure of a process of care.

The patient determines the role of the representative, to the extent possible.

*Subdivision* means a component of a multi-function health agency, such as the home care department of a hospital or the nursing division of a health department, which independently meets the conditions of participation for HHAs. A subdivision that has branch offices is considered a parent agency.

*Summary report* means the compilation of the pertinent factors of a patient's clinical notes that is submitted to the patient's physician.

*Supervised practical training* means training in a practicum laboratory or other setting in which the trainee demonstrates knowledge while providing covered services to an individual under the direct supervision of either a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse who is under the supervision of a registered nurse.

*Verbal order* means a physician order that is spoken to appropriate personnel and later put in writing for the purposes of documenting as well as establishing or revising the patient's plan of care.
