*Branch office* means a location or site from which a home health agency provides services within a portion of the total geographic area served by the parent agency.

*Clinical note* means a notation of a contact with a patient that is written and dated by a member of the health team, and that describes signs and symptoms, treatment and drugs administered and the patient's reaction, and any changes in physical or emotional condition.

*HHA* stands for home health agency.

*Nonprofit agency* means an agency exempt from Federal income taxation under section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.
