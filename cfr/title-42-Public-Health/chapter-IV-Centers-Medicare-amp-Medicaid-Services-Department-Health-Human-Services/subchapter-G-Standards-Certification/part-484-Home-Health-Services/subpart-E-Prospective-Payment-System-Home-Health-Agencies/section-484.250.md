(c) *Survey requirements.* An HHA must contract with an approved, independent HHCAHPS survey vendor to administer the HHCAHPS Survey on its behalf.

Such organizations will not be approved by CMS as HHCAHPS survey vendors.

(3) Approved HHCAHPS survey vendors must fully comply with all HHCAHPS oversight activities, including allowing CMS and its HHCAHPS program team to perform site visits at the vendors' company locations.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, CMS will not consider an exception or extension request unless the HHA requesting such exception or extension has complied fully with the requirements in this paragraph (d).

(4) CMS may grant exceptions or extensions to HHAs without a request if it determines that one or more of the following has occurred:

(i) An extraordinary circumstance affects an entire region or locale.
