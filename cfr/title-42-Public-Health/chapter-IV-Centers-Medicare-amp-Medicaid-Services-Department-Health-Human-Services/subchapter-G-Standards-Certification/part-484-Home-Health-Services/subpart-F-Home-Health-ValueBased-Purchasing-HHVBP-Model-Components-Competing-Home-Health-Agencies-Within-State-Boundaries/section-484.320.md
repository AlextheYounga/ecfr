##### ยง 484.320 Calculation of the Total Performance Score. #####

A competing home health agency's Total Performance Score for a model year is calculated as follows:

(a) CMS will award points to the competing home health agency for performance on each of the applicable measures excluding the New Measures.

(b) CMS will award points to the competing home health agency for reporting on each of the New Measures worth up to ten percent of the Total Performance Score.

(c) CMS will sum all points awarded for each applicable measure excluding the New Measures weighted equally at the individual measure level, to calculate a value worth 90-percent of the Total Performance Score.

(d) The sum of the points awarded to a competing HHA for each applicable measure and the points awarded to a competing HHA for reporting data on each New Measure is the competing HHA's Total Performance Score for the calendar year.
