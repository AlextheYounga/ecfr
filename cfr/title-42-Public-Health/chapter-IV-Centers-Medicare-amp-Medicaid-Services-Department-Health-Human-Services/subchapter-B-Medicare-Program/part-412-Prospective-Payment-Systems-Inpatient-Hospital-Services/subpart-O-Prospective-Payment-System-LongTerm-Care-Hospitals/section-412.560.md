(b) *Submission of data requirements and payment impact.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a long-term care hospital must submit to CMS data on measures specified under sections 1886(m)(5)(D), 1899B(c)(1), and 1899B(d)(1) of the Act, as applicable, in a form and manner, and at a time, specified by CMS.

(2) A long-term care hospital that does not submit data in accordance with sections 1886(m)(5)(C) and 1886(m)(5)(F) of the Act with respect to a given fiscal year will have its annual update to the standard Federal rate for discharges for the long-term care hospital during the fiscal year reduced by 2 percentage points.

(c) *Exception and extension request requirements.* Upon request by a long-term care hospital, CMS may grant an exception or extension with respect to the quality data reporting requirements, for one or more quarters, in the event of certain extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the long-term care hospital, subject to the following:

(1) A long-term care hospital that wishes to request an exception or extension with respect to quality data reporting requirements must submit its request to CMS within 90 days of the date that the extraordinary circumstances occurred.

(2) A long-term care hospital must submit its request for an exception or extension to CMS via email. Email is the only form that may be used to submit to CMS a request for an exception or an extension.

(3) The email request for an exception or extension must contain the following information:

(i) The CCN for the long-term care hospital.

(ii) The business name of the long-term care hospital.

(iii) The business address of the long-term care hospital.

(vi) Evidence of the impact of the extraordinary circumstances, including, but not limited to, photographs, newspaper articles, and other media.

(vii) The date on which the long-term care hospital will be able to again submit quality data under the LTCHQR Program and a justification for the proposed date.

(4) CMS may grant an exception or extension to a long-term care hospital that has not been requested by the long-term care hospital if CMS determines that -

(i) An extraordinary circumstance affects an entire region or locale; or

(ii) A systemic problem with one of CMS' data collection systems directly affected the ability of the long-term care hospital to submit quality data.

(d) *Reconsiderations of noncompliance decisions* - (1) *Written notification of noncompliance decision.* CMS will send a long-term care hospital written notification of a decision of noncompliance with the quality data reporting requirements for a particular fiscal year. CMS also will use the Quality Improvement and Evaluation system (QIES) Assessment Submission and Processing (ASAP) System to provide notification of noncompliance to the long-term care hospital.

(2) *Request for reconsideration of noncompliance decision.* A long-term care hospital may request a reconsideration of CMS' decision of noncompliance no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the written notification of noncompliance.

(ii) The business name of the long-term care hospital.

(iii) The business address of the long-term care hospital.

(iv) Contact information for the long-term care hospital's chief executive officer or designated personnel, including each individual's name, title, email address, telephone number, and physical mailing address. (The physical address may not be a post office box.)

(vi) The reason for requesting reconsideration of CMS' noncompliance decision.

(vii) Accompanying documentation that demonstrates compliance of the long-term care hospital with the quality reporting requirements. This documentation must be submitted electronically at the same time as the reconsideration request as an attachment to the email. Any reconsideration request that fails to provide sufficient evidence of compliance will not be reviewed.

(3) *CMS decision on reconsideration request.* CMS will notify the long-term care hospital, in writing, of its final decision regarding any reconsideration request. CMS also will use the QIES ASAP System to provide notice of its final decision on the reconsideration request.

(e) *Appeals of reconsideration requests.* A long-term care hospital that is dissatisfied with a decision made by CMS on its reconsideration request may file an appeal with the Provider Reimbursement Review Board under part 405, subpart R, of this chapter.
