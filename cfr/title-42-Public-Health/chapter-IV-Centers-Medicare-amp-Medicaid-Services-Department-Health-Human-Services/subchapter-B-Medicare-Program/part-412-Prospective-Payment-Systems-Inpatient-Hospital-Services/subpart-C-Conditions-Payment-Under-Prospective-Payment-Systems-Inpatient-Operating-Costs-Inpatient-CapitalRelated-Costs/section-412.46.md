##### ยง 412.46 Medical review requirements. #####

(a) *Physician acknowledgement.* (1) *Basis.* Because payment under the prospective payment system is based in part on each patient's principal and secondary diagnoses and major procedures performed, as evidenced by the physician's entries in the patient's medical record, physicians must complete an acknowledgement statement to this effect.

(2) *Content of physician acknowledgement statement.* When a claim is submitted, the hospital must have on file a signed and dated acknowledgement from the attending physician that the physician has received the following notice:

Notice to Physicians: Medicare payment to hospitals is based in part on each patient's principal and secondary diagnoses and the major procedures performed on the patient, as attested to by the patient's attending physician by virtue of his or her signature in the medical record. Anyone who misrepresents, falsifies, or conceals essential information required for payment of Federal funds, may be subject to fine, imprisonment, or civil penalty under applicable Federal laws.

(3) *Completion of acknowledgement.* The acknowledgement must be completed by the physician at the time that the physician is granted admitting privileges at the hospital, or before or at the time the physician admits his or her first patient. Existing acknowledgements signed by physicians already on staff remain in effect as long as the physician has admitting privileges at the hospital.

(b) *Physician's order and certification regarding medical necessity.* No presumptive weight shall be assigned to the physician's order under ยง 412.3 or the physician's certification under Subpart B of Part 424 of the chapter in determining the medical necessity of inpatient hospital services under section 1862(a)(1) of the Act. A physician's order or certification will be evaluated in the context of the evidence in the medical record.
