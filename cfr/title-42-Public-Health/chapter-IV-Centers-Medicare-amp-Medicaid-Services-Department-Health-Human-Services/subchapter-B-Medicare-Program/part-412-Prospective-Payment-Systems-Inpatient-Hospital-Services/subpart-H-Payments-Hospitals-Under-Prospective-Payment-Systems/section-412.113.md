(A) The hospital or CAH is located in a rural area as defined in § 412.62(f) and is not deemed to be located in an urban area under the provisions of § 412.64(b)(3). Effective December 2, 2010, the hospital or CAH is either located in a rural area as defined at § 412.62(f) and is not deemed to be located in an urban area under the provisions of § 412.64(b)(3) or the hospital or CAH has reclassified as rural under the provisions at § 412.103.

(B) The hospital or CAH must have employed or contracted with a qualified nonphysician anesthetist, as defined in § 410.69 of this chapter, as of January 1, 1988 to perform anesthesia services in that hospital or CAH.

(C) The hospital or CAH must provide data for its entire patient population to demonstrate that, during calendar year 1987, its volume of surgical procedures (inpatient and outpatient) requiring anesthesia services did not exceed 250 procedures. For purposes of this section, a *surgical procedure requiring anesthesia services* means a surgical procedure in which the anesthesia is administered and monitored by a qualified nonphysician anesthetist, a physician other than the primary surgeon, or an intern or resident.

(D) Each qualified nonphysician anesthetist employed by or under contract with the hospital or CAH has agreed in writing not to bill on a reasonable charge basis for his or her patient care to Medicare beneficiaries in that hospital or CAH.

(ii) To maintain its eligibility for reasonable cost payment under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section in calendar years after 1989, a qualified hospital or CAH must demonstrate prior to January 1 of each respective year that for the prior year its volume of surgical procedures requiring anesthesia service did not exceed 500 procedures; or, effective October 1, 2002, did not exceed 800 procedures.

(iii) A hospital or CAH that did not qualify for reasonable cost payment for nonphysician anesthetist services furnished in calendar year 1989 can qualify in subsequent years if it meets the criteria in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(A), (B), and (D) of this section, and demonstrates to its intermediary prior to the start of the calendar year that it met these criteria. The hospital or CAH must provide data for its entire patient population to demonstrate that, during calendar year 1987 and the year immediately preceding its election of reasonable cost payment, its volume of surgical procedures (inpatient and outpatient) requiring anesthesia services did not exceed 500 procedures, or, effective October 1, 2002, did not exceed 800 procedures.

(iv) For administrative purposes for the calendar years after 1990, the volume of surgical procedures for the immediately preceding year is the sum of the surgical procedures for the nine month period ending September 30, annualized for the twelve month period.

(d) *Organ acquisition.* Payment for organ acquisition costs incurred by hospitals with approved transplantation centers is made on a reasonable cost basis. The term “Organs” is defined in § 486.302 of this chapter.
