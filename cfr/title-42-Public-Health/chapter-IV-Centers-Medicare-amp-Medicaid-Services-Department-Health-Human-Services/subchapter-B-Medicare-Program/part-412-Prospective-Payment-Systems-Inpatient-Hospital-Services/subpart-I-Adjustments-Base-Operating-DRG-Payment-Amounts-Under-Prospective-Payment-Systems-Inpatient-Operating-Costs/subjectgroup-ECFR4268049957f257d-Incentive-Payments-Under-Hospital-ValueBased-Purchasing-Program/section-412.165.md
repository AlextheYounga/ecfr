(a) *Points awarded based on hospital performance.* (1) CMS will award points to hospitals for performance on each measure for which the hospital reports the applicable minimum number of cases during the applicable performance period.

(2) CMS will award from 1 to 9 points for achievement to each hospital whose performance on a measure during the applicable performance period meets or exceeds the achievement threshold but is less than the benchmark for that measure.

(3) CMS will award from 0 to 9 points for improvement to each hospital whose performance on a measure during the applicable performance period exceeds the improvement threshold but is less than the benchmark for that measure.

(4) CMS will award 10 points to a hospital whose performance on a measure during the applicable performance period meets or exceeds the benchmark for that measure.

(b) *Calculation of the Total Performance Score.* The hospital's Total Performance Score for a program year is calculated as follows:

(1) CMS will calculate a domain score for a hospital when it reports the minimum number of measures in the domain.

(2) CMS will sum all points awarded for each measure in a domain to calculate an unweighted domain score.

(3) CMS will normalize each domain score to ensure that it is expressed as a percentage of points earned out of 100.

(4) CMS will weight the domain scores with the finalized domain weights for each fiscal year.

(5) The sum of the weighted domain scores is the hospital's Total Performance Score for the fiscal year.
