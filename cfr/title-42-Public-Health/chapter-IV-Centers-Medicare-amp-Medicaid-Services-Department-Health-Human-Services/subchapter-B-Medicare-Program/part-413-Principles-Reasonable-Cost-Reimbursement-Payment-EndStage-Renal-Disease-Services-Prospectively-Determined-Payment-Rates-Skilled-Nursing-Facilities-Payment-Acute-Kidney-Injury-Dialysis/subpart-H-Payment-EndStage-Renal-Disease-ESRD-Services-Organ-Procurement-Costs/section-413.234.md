*New injectable or intravenous product.* An injectable or intravenous product that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, commercially available, assigned a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code, and designated by CMS as a renal dialysis service under § 413.171.

*Oral-only drug.* A drug or biological with no injectable equivalent or other form of administration other than an oral form.

(b) *Drug designation process.* Effective January 1, 2016, new injectable or intravenous products are included in the ESRD PPS bundled payment using the following drug designation process:

(1) If the new injectable or intravenous product is used to treat or manage a condition for which there is an ESRD PPS functional category, the new injectable or intravenous product is considered included in the ESRD PPS bundled payment and no separate payment is available.

(2) If the new injectable or intravenous product is used to treat or manage a condition for which there is not an ESRD PPS functional category, the new injectable or intravenous product is not considered included in the ESRD PPS bundled payment and the following steps occur:

(i) An existing ESRD PPS functional category is revised or a new ESRD PPS functional category is added for the condition that the new injectable or intravenous product is used to treat or manage;

(ii) The new injectable or intravenous product is paid for using the transitional drug add-on payment adjustment described in paragraph (c) of this section; and

(iii) The new injectable or intravenous product is added to the ESRD PPS bundled payment following payment of the transitional drug add-on payment adjustment.

(c) *Transitional drug add-on payment adjustment.* (1) A new injectable or intravenous product that is not considered included in the ESRD PPS base rate is paid for using a transitional drug add-on payment adjustment, which is based on pricing methodologies under section 1847A of the Social Security Act.

(2) The transitional drug add-on payment adjustment is paid until sufficient claims data for rate setting analysis for the new injectable or intravenous product is available, but not for less than two years.

(3) Following payment of the transitional drug add-on payment adjustment the ESRD PPS base rate will be modified, if appropriate, to account for the new injectable or intravenous product in the ESRD PPS bundled payment.

(d) *Oral-only drug determination.* An oral-only drug is no longer considered oral-only if an injectable or other form of administration of the oral-only drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
