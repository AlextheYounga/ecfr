##### ยง 413.416 Organ acquisition charges for kidney-paired exchanges. #####

(a) *Initial living donor evaluations.* When a recipient and donor elect to participate in a kidney paired exchange, the costs of the initial living donor evaluations are incurred by the originally intended recipient's transplant hospital, regardless of whether the living donor actually donates to their originally intended recipient, a kidney paired exchange recipient, or does not donate at all.

(b) *Additional tests after a match.* In a kidney paired exchange, regardless of whether an actual donation occurs, once the donor and recipient are matched, any additional tests requested by the recipient's transplant hospital and performed by the donor's transplant hospital, are billed to the recipient's transplant hospital as charges reduced to cost (using the donor's transplant hospital's cost to charge ratio) and included as acquisition costs on the recipient transplant hospital's Medicare cost report.

(4) The recipient's transplant hospital records as part of its kidney acquisition costs -

(i) The amounts billed by the donor's transplant hospital for the reasonable costs associated with procuring, packaging, and transporting the organ; and

(ii) Any additional testing performed and billed by the donor's transplant hospital.
