(a) *General.* A donor community hospital (a Medicare-certified non-transplant hospital) and a transplant hospital incur organ acquisition costs for donor organ procurement services, authorized by the OPO following declaration of death and consent to donate.

(b) *Amounts billed for organ acquisition costs.* For cost reporting periods beginning on or after February 25, 2022, when a donor community hospital or a transplant hospital incurs costs for services furnished to a cadaveric donor, as authorized by the OPO, the donor community hospital or transplant hospital must bill the OPO the lesser of its customary charges that are reduced to cost by applying its most recently available hospital specific cost-to-charge ratio for the period in which the service was rendered, or a negotiated rate.
