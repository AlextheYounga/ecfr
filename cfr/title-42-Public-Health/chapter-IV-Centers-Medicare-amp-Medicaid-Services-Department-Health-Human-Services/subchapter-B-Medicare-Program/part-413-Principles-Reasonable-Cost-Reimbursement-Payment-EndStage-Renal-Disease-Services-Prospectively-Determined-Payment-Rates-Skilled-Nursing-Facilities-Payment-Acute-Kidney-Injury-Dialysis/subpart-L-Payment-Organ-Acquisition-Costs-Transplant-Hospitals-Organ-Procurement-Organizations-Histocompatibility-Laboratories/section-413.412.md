##### ยง 413.412 Intent to transplant, and counting en bloc, research, and discarded organs and kidneys. #####

(a) *Principle of intent to transplant for organ acquisition payment purposes.* (1) An organ is intended for transplant when the OPO or TH designates it for transplant prior to the time the donor enters the hospital's operating room for surgical excision/recovery of the organ(s).

(2) OPOs and THs must identify the costs associated with the recovered and unrecovered organs and apportion those costs to the appropriate cost centers by organ type.

(b) *Counting en bloc organs.* En bloc organs can be en bloc lungs or en bloc kidneys. For Medicare cost allocation purposes, OPOs and THs count -

(1) En bloc lungs or en bloc kidneys procured and transplanted en bloc (two organs transplanted as one unit) as one total usable organ. En bloc organs transplanted into a Medicare beneficiary count as one Medicare usable organ or one Medicare usable kidney.

(2) En bloc lungs and en bloc kidneys procured en bloc but separated and transplanted into two different recipients as two total usable organs. For each organ transplanted into a Medicare beneficiary, count each as one Medicare usable organ or one Medicare usable kidney.

(c) *Research organs.* For Medicare cost allocation purposes, organs used for research are not counted as Medicare usable organs in Medicare's share of organ acquisition costs (except pancreata for islet cell transplants as specified in ยง 413.406(a)) and kidneys used for research are not counted as Medicare usable kidneys in Medicare's share of kidney acquisition costs.

(d) *Counting of discarded/unusable organs.* An organ is not counted as a Medicare usable organ or a total usable organ if the excising surgeon determines, upon initial inspection or after removal of the organ, that the organ is not viable and not medically suitable for transplant and the organ is determined to be unusable and discarded.
