(a) *Definitions.* As used in this section:

(1) *Achievement threshold (or achievement performance standard)* means the 25th percentile of SNF performance on the SNF readmission measure during the baseline period for a fiscal year.

(2) *Adjusted Federal per diem rate* means the payment made to SNFs under the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system (as described under section 1888(e)(4)(G) of the Act).

(3) *Applicable percent* means for FY 2019 and subsequent fiscal years, 2.0 percent.

(4) *Baseline period* means the time period used to calculate the achievement threshold, benchmark and improvement threshold that apply for a fiscal year.

(5) *Benchmark* means, for a fiscal year, the arithmetic mean of the top decile of SNF performance on the SNF readmission measure during the baseline period for that fiscal year.

(6) *Logistic exchange function* means the function used to translate a SNF's performance score on the SNF readmission measure into a value-based incentive payment percentage.

(7) *Improvement threshold (or improvement performance standard)* means an individual SNF's performance on the SNF readmission measure during the applicable baseline period.

(8) *Performance period* means the time period during which performance on the SNF readmission measure is calculated for a fiscal year.

(9) *Performance standards* are the levels of performance that SNFs must meet or exceed to earn points under the SNF VBP Program for a fiscal year, and are announced no later than 60 days prior to the start of the performance period that applies to the SNF readmission measure for that fiscal year.

(10) *Ranking* means the ordering of SNFs based on each SNF's performance score under the SNF VBP Program for a fiscal year.

(11) *SNF readmission measure* means, for a fiscal year, the all-cause all-condition hospital readmission measure (SNFRM) or the all-condition risk-adjusted potentially preventable hospital readmission rate (SNFPPR) specified by CMS for application in the SNF Value-Based Purchasing Program.

(12) *Performance score* means the numeric score ranging from 0 to 100 awarded to each SNF based on its performance under the SNF VBP Program for a fiscal year.

(13) *SNF Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program* means the program required under section 1888(h) of the Social Security Act.

(14) *Value-based incentive payment amount* is the portion of a SNF's adjusted Federal per diem rate that is attributable to the SNF VBP Program.

(15) *Value-based incentive payment adjustment factor* is the number that will be multiplied by the adjusted Federal per diem rate for services furnished by a SNF during a fiscal year, based on its performance score for that fiscal year, and after such rate is reduced by the applicable percent.

(b) *Applicability of the SNF VBP Program.* The SNF VBP Program applies to SNFs, including facilities described in section 1888(e)(7)(B).

(c) *Process for reducing the adjusted Federal per diem rate and applying the value-based incentive payment adjustment factor under the SNF VBP Program* - (1) *General.* CMS will make value-based incentive payments to each SNF based on its performance score for a fiscal year under the SNF VBP Program under the requirements and conditions specified in this paragraph.

(2) *Value-based incentive payment amount* - (i) *Total amount available for a fiscal year.* The total amount available for value-based incentive payments for a fiscal year is equal to 60 percent of the total amount of the reduction to the adjusted SNF PPS payments for that fiscal year, as estimated by CMS.

(ii) *Calculation of the value-based incentive payment amount.* The value-based incentive payment amount is calculated by multiplying the adjusted Federal per diem rate by the value- based incentive payment adjustment factor, after the adjusted Federal per diem rate has been reduced by the applicable percent.

(iii) *Calculation of the value-based incentive payment adjustment factor.* The value-based incentive payment adjustment factor is calculated by estimating Medicare spending under the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system to estimate the total amount available for value-based incentive payments, ordering SNFs by their SNF performance scores, then assigning an adjustment factor value for each performance score subject to the limitations set by the exchange function.

(iv) *Reporting of adjustment to SNF payments.* CMS will inform each SNF of the value-based incentive payment adjustment factor that will be applied to its adjusted Federal per diem rate for services furnished during a fiscal year at least 60 days prior to the start of that fiscal year.

(d) *Performance scoring under the SNF VBP Program.* (1) CMS will award points to SNFs based on their performance on the SNF readmission measure applicable to a fiscal year during the performance period applicable to that fiscal year as follows:

(i) CMS will award from 1 to 99 points for achievement to each SNF whose performance meets or exceeds the achievement threshold but is less than the benchmark.

(ii) CMS will award from 0 to 90 points for improvement to each SNF whose performance exceeds the improvement threshold but is less than the benchmark.

(iii) CMS will award 100 points to a SNF whose performance meets or exceeds the benchmark.

(2) The highest of the SNF's achievement, improvement and benchmark score will be the SNF's performance score for the fiscal year.

(e) *Confidential feedback reports and public reporting.* (1) Beginning October 1, 2016, CMS will provide quarterly confidential feedback reports to SNFs on their performance on the SNF readmission measure. SNFs will have the opportunity to review and submit corrections for this data by March 31st following the date that CMS provides the reports. Any such correction requests must be accompanied by appropriate evidence showing the basis for the correction.

(2) Beginning not later than 60 days prior to each fiscal year, CMS will provide SNF performance score reports to SNFs on their performance under the SNF VBP Program for a fiscal year. SNFs will have the opportunity to review and submit corrections to their SNF performance scores and ranking contained in these reports for 30 days following the date that CMS provides the reports. Any such correction requests must be accompanied by appropriate evidence showing the basis for the correction.

(3) CMS will publicly report the information described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this section on the Nursing Home Compare Web site.

(f) *Limitations on review.* There is no administrative or judicial review of the following:

(1) The methodology used to determine the value-based incentive payment percentage and the amount of the value-based incentive payment under section 1888(h)(5) of the Act.

(2) The determination of the amount of funding available for value-based incentive payments under section 1888(h)(5)(C)(ii)(III) of the Act and the payment reduction under section 1888(h)(6) of the Act.

(3) The establishment of the performance standards under section 1888(h)(3) of the Act and the performance period.

(4) The methodology developed under section 1888(h)(4) of the Act that is used to calculate SNF performance scores and the calculation of such scores.

(5) The ranking determinations under section 1888(h)(4)(B) of the Act.
