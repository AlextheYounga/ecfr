(a) *Purpose and Scope.* This section implements section 1881(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Act by specifying recordkeeping and cost reporting requirements for ESRD facilities under part 494 of this chapter. The records and reports will enable CMS to determine the costs incurred in furnishing outpatient maintenance dialysis as defined in § 413.170(a).

(b) *Recordkeeping and reporting requirements.* (1) Each facility must keep adequate records and submit the appropriate CMS-approved cost report in accordance with §§ 413.20 and 413.24, which provide rules on financial data and reports, and adequate cost data and cost finding, respectively.

(2) The cost reimbursement principles set forth in this part (beginning with § 413.134, Depreciation, and excluding the principles listed in paragraph (b)(4) of this section), apply in the determination and reporting of the allowable cost incurred in furnishing outpatient maintenance dialysis treatments to patients dialyzing in the facility, or incurred by the facility in furnishing home dialysis service, supplies, and equipment.

Reasonable cost includes all necessary and proper expenses incurred by the facility in furnishing the dialysis treatments, such as administrative costs, maintenance costs, and premium payments for employee health and pension plans.

(i) Section 413.157, Return on equity capital of proprietary providers;

(ii) Section 413.200, Reimbursement of OPAs and histocompatibility laboratories;
