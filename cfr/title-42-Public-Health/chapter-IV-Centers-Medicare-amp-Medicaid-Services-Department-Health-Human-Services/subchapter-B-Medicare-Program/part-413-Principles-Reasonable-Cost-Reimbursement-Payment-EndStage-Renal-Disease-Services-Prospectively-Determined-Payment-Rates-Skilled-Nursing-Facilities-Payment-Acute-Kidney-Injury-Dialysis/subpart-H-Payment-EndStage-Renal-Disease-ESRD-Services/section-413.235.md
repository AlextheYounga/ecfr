Adjustments to the per-treatment base rate may be made to account for variation in case-mix. These adjustments reflect patient characteristics that result in higher costs for ESRD facilities.

(b) CMS adjusts the per treatment base rate for pediatric patients in accordance with section 1881(b)(14) (D)(iv)(I) of the Act, to account for patient age and treatment modality.

(c) CMS provides a wage-adjusted add-on per treatment adjustment for home and self-dialysis training.
