##### § 407.40 Enrollment under a State buy-in agreement. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 66507, Nov. 3, 2022.

(a) *Statutory basis.* (1) Section 1843 of the Act, as amended through 1969, permitted a State to enter into an agreement with the Secretary to enroll in the SMI program certain individuals who are eligible for SMI and who are members of the buy-in group specified in the agreement. A buy-in group could include certain individuals receiving Federally-aided State cash assistance (with the option of excluding individuals also entitled to social security benefits or railroad retirement benefits) or could include all individuals eligible for Medicaid. Before 1981, December 31, 1969 was the last day on which a State could request a buy-in agreement or a modification to include a coverage group broader than the one originally selected.

(2) Section 945(e) of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-499) further amended section 1843 to provide that, during calendar year 1981, a State could request a buy-in agreement if it did not already have one, or request a broader coverage group for an existing agreement.

(3) Several laws enacted during 1980-1987 had the effect of requiring that the buy-in groups available under section 1843 of the Act be expanded to include certain individuals who lose eligibility for cash assistance payments but are treated as if they were cash assistance beneficiaries for Medicaid eligibility purposes.

(4) Section 301(e)(1) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-360) amends section 1843 of the Act to restore the 1981 provisions on a permanent basis, effective “after 1988.”

(5) The same section 301, as amended by section 608(d)(14)(H) of the Family Support Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-485), further amended section 1843 of the Act, beginning January 1, 1989, to establish a new buy-in category consisting of Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries and to provide that a State may request a buy-in agreement if it does not already have one, or request a broader buy-in group for the existing agreement.
