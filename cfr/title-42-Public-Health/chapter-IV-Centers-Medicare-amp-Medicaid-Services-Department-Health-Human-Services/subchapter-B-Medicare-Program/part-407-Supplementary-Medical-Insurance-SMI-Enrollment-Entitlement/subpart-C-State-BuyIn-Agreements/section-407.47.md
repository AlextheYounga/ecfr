##### § 407.47 Beginning of coverage under a State buy-in agreement. #####

(a) *General rule.* The beginning of an individual's coverage period depends on two factors:

(1) The individual's meeting the SMI eligibility requirements and the requirements for being a member of the buy-in group; and

(2) The effective date of the buy-in agreement or agreement modification that covers the group to which the individual belongs, and which may not be earlier than the third month after the month in which the agreement or modification is executed.

(b) *Application of general rule: Medicaid eligibles who are, or are treated as, cash assistance beneficiaries.* For Medicaid eligibles who are, or are treated as, cash assistance beneficiaries (that is, are members of categories A through E of § 407.42(a) or categories A through C of § 407.43(a)), coverage begins with the later of the following:

(1) The first month in which the individual -

(i) Meets the SMI eligibility requirements specified in § 407.10; and

(ii) Is a member of one of those categories.

(2) The month in which the buy-in agreement is effective.

(c) *Application of general rule: Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries.* For individuals who are QMBs (that is, are members of category F of § 407.42 or category D of § 407.43(a)), coverage begins with the later of the following:

(1) The first month in which the individual meets the SMI eligibility requirements specified in § 407.10, and has QMB status.

(2) The month in which the buy-in agreement or agreement modification covering QMBs is effective.

(d) *Application of general rule: Other individuals eligible for Medicaid.* For individuals who are members of category G of § 407.42(a) or category E of § 407.43(a), coverage begins with the later of the following:

(1) The second month after the month in which the individual -

(i) Meets the SMI eligibility requirements specified in § 407.10; and

(ii) Is determined to be eligible for Medicaid.

(2) The month in which the buy-in agreement or agreement modification is effective.

(e) *Coverage based on erroneous report.* If the State erroneously reports to SSA that an individual is a member of its coverage group, the rules of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section apply, and coverage begins as though the individual were in fact a member of the group. Coverage will end only as provided in § 407.48.
