##### ยง 407.25 Beginning of entitlement: Individual enrollment. #####

The following apply whether an individual is self-enrolled or automatically enrolled in SMI:

(a) *Enrollment during initial enrollment period.* (1) If an individual enrolls during the first three months of the initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the first month of eligibility.

(2) If an individual enrolls during the fourth month of the initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the following month.

(3) If an individual enrolls during the fifth month of the initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the second month after the month of enrollment.

(4) If an individual enrolls in either of the last two months of the initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the third month after the month of enrollment.

(5) Example. An individual first meets the eligibility requirements for enrollment in April. The initial enrollment period is January through July. The month in which the individual enrolls determines the month that begins the period of entitlement, as follows:
