##### § 407.25 Beginning of entitlement: Individual enrollment. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 66506, Nov. 3, 2022.

The following apply whether an individual is self-enrolled or automatically enrolled in SMI:

(a) *Enrollment during initial enrollment period.* (1) If an individual enrolls during the first three months of the initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the first month of eligibility.

(2) If an individual enrolls during the fourth month of the initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the following month.

(3) If an individual enrolls during the fifth month of the initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the second month after the month of enrollment.

(4) If an individual enrolls in either of the last two months of the initial enrollment period, entitlement begins with the third month after the month of enrollment.

(5) Example. An individual first meets the eligibility requirements for enrollment in April. The initial enrollment period is January through July. The month in which the individual enrolls determines the month that begins the period of entitlement, as follows:

|Enrolls in initial enrollment period|              Entitlement begins on -               |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|              January               |April 1 (month eligibility requirements first met). |
|              February              |                      April 1.                      |
|               March                |                      April 1.                      |
|               April                |    May 1 (month following month of enrollment).    |
|                May                 |  July 1 (second month after month of enrollment).  |
|                June                |September 1 (third month after month of enrollment).|
|                July                | October 1 (third month after month of enrollment). |

(b) *Enrollment on reenrollment during general enrollment period.* (1) if an individual enrolls or reenrolls during a general enrollment period before April 1, 1981 or after September 30, 1981, entitlement begins on July 1 of that calendar year.

(2) If an individual enrolled or reenrolled during the general enrollment period between April 1, 1981 and September 20, 1981, entitlement began with the third month after the month in which the enrollment request was filed.
