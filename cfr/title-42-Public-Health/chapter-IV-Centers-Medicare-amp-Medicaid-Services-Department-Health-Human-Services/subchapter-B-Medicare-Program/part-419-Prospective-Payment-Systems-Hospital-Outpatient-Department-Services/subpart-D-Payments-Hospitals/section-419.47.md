(a) *Creation of a new HCPCS code for Category B IDE Studies.* CMS will create a new HCPCS code, or revise an existing HCPCS code, to describe a Category B IDE study, which will include both the treatment and control arms, related device(s) of the study, as well as routine care items and services, as specified under § 405.201 of this chapter, when CMS determines that:

(1) The Medicare coverage IDE study criteria in § 405.212 of this chapter are met; and

(1) Make a single packaged payment for the HCPCS code that includes payment for the investigational device, placebo control, and routine care items and services of a Category B IDE study, as specified under § 405.201 of this chapter; and

(2) Calculate the single packaged payment rate for the HCPCS code based on the average resources utilized for each study participant, including the frequency with which the investigational device is used in the study population.
