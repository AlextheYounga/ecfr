(v) Insurance policies or other arrangements, secured and maintained by the MA organization and approved by CMS to insure the MA organization against losses arising from professional liability claims, fire, theft, fraud, embezzlement, and other casualty risks.

(vi) Adopt and implement an effective compliance program, which must include measures that prevent, detect, and correct non-compliance with CMS' program requirements as well as measures that prevent, detect, and correct fraud, waste, and abuse. The compliance program must, at a minimum, include the following core requirements:

(*6*) Describe how potential compliance issues are investigated and resolved by the organization; and

(*7*) Include a policy of non-intimidation and non-retaliation for good faith participation in the compliance program, including but not limited to reporting potential issues, investigating issues, conducting self-evaluations, audits and remedial actions, and reporting to appropriate officials.

(B) The designation of a compliance officer and a compliance committee who report directly and are accountable to the organization's chief executive or other senior management.

(*1*) The compliance officer, vested with the day-to-day operations of the compliance program, must be an employee of the MA organization, parent organization or corporate affiliate. The compliance officer may not be an employee of the MA organization's first tier, downstream or related entity.

(C)(*1*) Each MA organization must establish and implement effective training and education between the compliance officer and organization employees, the MA organization's chief executive or other senior administrator, managers and governing body members, and the MA organization's first tier, downstream, and related entities. Such training and education must occur at a minimum annually and must be made a part of the orientation for a new employee, new first tier, downstream and related entities, and new appointment to a chief executive, manager, or governing body member.

(*3*) An MA organization must require all of its first tier, downstream, and related entities to take the CMS training and accept the certificate of completion of the CMS training as satisfaction of this requirement. MA organizations are prohibited from developing and implementing their own training or providing supplemental training materials to fulfill this requirement.

(*2*) Identify noncompliance or unethical behavior; and

(*3*) Provide for timely, consistent, and effective enforcement of the standards when noncompliance or unethical behavior is determined.

(F) Establishment and implementation of an effective system for routine monitoring and identification of compliance risks. The system should include internal monitoring and audits and, as appropriate, external audits, to evaluate the MA organization, including first tier entities', compliance with CMS requirements and the overall effectiveness of the compliance program.

(G) Establishment and implementation of procedures and a system for promptly responding to compliance issues as they are raised, investigating potential compliance problems as identified in the course of self-evaluations and audits, correcting such problems promptly and thoroughly to reduce the potential for recurrence, and ensure ongoing compliance with CMS requirements.

(*1*) If the MA organization discovers evidence of misconduct related to payment or delivery of items or services under the contract, it must conduct a timely, reasonable inquiry into that conduct.

(*2*) The MA organization must conduct appropriate corrective actions (for example, repayment of overpayments, disciplinary actions against responsible employees) in response to the potential violation referenced in paragraph (b)(4)(vi)(G)(1) of this section.

(i) During the 6-month period beginning on the date the organization notified CMS of the intention to non-renew the most recent previous contract, there was a change in the statute or regulations that had the effect of increasing MA payments in the payment area or areas at issue; or

(ii) CMS has otherwise determined that circumstances warrant special consideration.

(7) Not have terminated a contract by mutual consent under which, as a condition of the consent, the MA organization agreed that it was not eligible to apply for new contracts or service area expansions for a period of 2 years per § 422.508(c) of this subpart.

(c) *Contracting authority.* Under the authority of section 1857(c)(5) of the Act, CMS may enter into contracts under this part without regard to Federal and Departmental acquisition regulations set forth in title 48 of the CFR and provisions of law or other regulations relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification of contracts of the United States if CMS determines that those provisions are inconsistent with the efficient and effective administration of the Medicare program.

(d) *Protection against fraud and beneficiary protections.* (1) CMS annually audits the financial records (including data relating to Medicare utilization, costs, and computation of the bid) of at least one-third of the MA organizations offering MA plans. These auditing activities are subject to monitoring by the Comptroller General.

(2) Each contract under this section must provide that CMS, or any person or organization designated by CMS has the right to:

(i) Inspect or otherwise evaluate the quality, appropriateness, and timeliness of services performed under the MA contract;

(ii) Inspect or otherwise evaluate the facilities of the organization when there is reasonable evidence of some need for such inspection; and

(e) *Severability of contracts.* The contract must provide that, upon CMS's request -

(1) The contract will be amended to exclude any MA plan or State-licensed entity specified by CMS; and
