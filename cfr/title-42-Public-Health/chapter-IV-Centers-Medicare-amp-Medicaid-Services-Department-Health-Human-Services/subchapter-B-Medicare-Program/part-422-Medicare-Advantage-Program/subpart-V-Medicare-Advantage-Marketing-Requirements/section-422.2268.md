##### ยง 422.2268 Standards for MA organization marketing. #####

In conducting marketing activities, MA organizations may not -

(a) Provide cash or other monetary rebates as an inducement for enrollment or otherwise.

(b) Offer gifts to potential enrollees, unless the gifts are of nominal (as defined in the CMS Marketing Guidelines) value, are offered to all potential enrollees without regard to whether or not the beneficiary enrolls, and are not in the form of cash or other monetary rebates.

(c) Engage in any discriminatory activity such as, for example, attempts to recruit Medicare beneficiaries from higher income areas without making comparable efforts to enroll Medicare beneficiaries from lower income areas.

(d) Solicit door-to-door for Medicare beneficiaries or through other unsolicited means of direct contact, including calling a beneficiary without the beneficiary initiating the contact.

(e) Engage in activities that could mislead or confuse Medicare beneficiaries, or misrepresent the MA organization. The MA organization may not claim it is recommended or endorsed by CMS or Medicare or that CMS or Medicare recommends that the beneficiary enroll in the MA plan. It may, however, explain that the organization is approved for participation in Medicare.

(f) Market non-health care related products to prospective enrollees during any MA or Part D sales activity or presentation. This is considered cross-selling and is prohibited.

(g) Market any health care related product during a marketing appointment beyond the scope agreed upon by the beneficiary, and documented by the plan, prior to the appointment (48 hours in advance, when practicable).

(h) Market additional health related lines of plan business not identified prior to an individual appointment without a separate scope of appointment identifying the additional lines of business to be discussed.

(i) Distribute marketing materials for which, before expiration of the 45-day period, the MA organization receives from CMS written notice of disapproval because it is inaccurate or misleading, or misrepresents the MA organization, its marketing representatives, or CMS.

(j) Use providers or provider groups to distribute printed information comparing the benefits of different health plans unless the providers, provider groups, or pharmacies accept and display materials from all health plans with which the providers, provider groups, or pharmacies contract. The use of publicly available comparison information is permitted if approved by CMS in accordance with the Medicare marketing guidance.

(k) Conduct sales presentations or distribute and accept MA plan enrollment forms in provider offices or other areas where health care is delivered to individuals, except in the case where such activities are conducted in common areas in health care settings.

(l) Conduct sales presentations or distribute and accept plan applications at educational events.

(m) Employ MA plan names that suggest that a plan is not available to all Medicare beneficiaries. This prohibition shall not apply to MA plan names in effect on July 31, 2000.

(n) Display the names and/or logos of co-branded network providers on the organization's member identification card, unless the provider names, and/or logos are related to the member selection of specific provider organizations (for example, physicians, hospitals). Other marketing materials (as defined in ยง 422.2260) that include names and/or logos of provider co-branding partners must clearly indicate that other providers are available in the network.

(o) Engage in any other marketing activity prohibited by CMS in its marketing guidance.

(p) Provide meals for potential enrollees, which is prohibited, regardless of value.

(q) Use a plan name that does not include the plan type. The plan type should be included at the end of the plan name.
