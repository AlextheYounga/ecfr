(1) Provide information that is inaccurate or misleading.

(2) Engage in activities that could mislead or confuse Medicare beneficiaries, or misrepresent the MA organization.

(3) Claim the MA organization is recommended or endorsed by CMS or Medicare or that CMS or Medicare recommends that the beneficiary enroll in the MA plan. It may explain that the organization is approved for participation in Medicare.

(5) Display the names and/or logos of co-branded network providers on the organization's member identification card, unless the provider names, and/or logos are related to the member selection of specific provider organizations (for example, physicians, hospitals).

(6) Use a plan name that does not include the plan type. The plan type should be included at the end of the plan name.

(7) For markets with a significant non-English speaking population, provide vital materials unless in the language of these individuals.
