(B) The amount paid to the third party for services other than selling insurance products, if any, must be fair-market value and must not exceed an amount that is commensurate with the amounts paid by the MA organization to a third party for similar services during each of the previous 2 years.

(2) *Compensation payment and payment recovery.* (i) Compensation may only be paid for the enrollee's months of enrollment during a plan year.
