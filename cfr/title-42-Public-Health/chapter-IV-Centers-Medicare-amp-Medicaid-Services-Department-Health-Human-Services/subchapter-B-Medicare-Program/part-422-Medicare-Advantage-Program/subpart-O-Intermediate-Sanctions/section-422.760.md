(1) The nature of the conduct;

(2) The degree of culpability of the MA organization;

(3) The adverse effect to enrollees which resulted or could have resulted from the conduct of MA organization;

(4) The financial condition of the MA organization;

(5) The history of prior offenses by the MA organization or principals of the MA organization; and,

(6) Such other matters as justice may require.

(b) *Amount of penalty imposed by CMS.* CMS may impose civil money penalties in the following amounts:

(1) If the deficiency on which the determination is based has directly adversely affected (or has the substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) one or more MA enrollees - up to $25,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 for each determination.

(2) If the deficiency on which the determination is based has directly adversely affected (or has the substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) one or more MA enrollees, CMS may calculate a CMP of up to $25,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 for each MA enrollee directly adversely affected (or with the substantial likelihood of being adversely affected) by a deficiency.

(3) CMS calculates the minimum penalty amounts under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section using the following criteria:

(C) CMS does the following:

(*1*) Tracks the calculation and accrual of the standard minimum penalty and aggravating factor amounts.

(*2*) Announces the penalties and amounts described in paragraph (b) of this section on an annual basis.

(4) For each week that a deficiency remains uncorrected after the week in which the MA organization receives CMS' notice of the determination - up to $10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102.

(5) If CMS makes a determination that a MA organization has terminated its contract other than in a manner described under 422.512 and that the MA organization has therefore failed to substantially carry out the terms of the contract - $250 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per Medicare enrollee from the terminated MA plan or plans at the time the MA organization terminated its contract, or $100,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, whichever is greater.

(3) Plus with respect to a determination made under § 422.752(a)(2), double the excess amount charged in violation of such paragraph (and the excess amount charged must be deducted from the penalty and returned to the individual concerned).

(4) Plus with respect to a determination made under § 422.752(a)(4), $15,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 for each individual not enrolled as a result of the practice involved.
