Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 60090, November 23, 2018.

(a) *Use of certified electronic health record technology (CEHRT)* - (1) *Required use of CEHRT.* To be an Advanced APM, an APM must:

(i) Require at least 50 percent of eligible clinicians in each participating APM Entity group, or, for APMs in which hospitals are the APM Entities, each hospital, to use CEHRT to document and communicate clinical care to their patients or other health care providers; or

(ii) For the Shared Savings Program, apply a penalty or reward to an APM Entity based on the degree of the use of CEHRT of the eligible clinicians in the APM Entity.

(b) *Payment based on quality measures.* (1) To be an Advanced APM, an APM must include quality measure results as a factor when determining payment to participants under the terms of the APM.

(2) At least one of the quality measures upon which an Advanced APM bases the payment in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must have an evidence-based focus, be reliable and valid, and meet at least one of the following criteria:

(i) Used in the MIPS quality performance category as described in § 414.1330;

(ii) Endorsed by a consensus-based entity;

(iii) Developed under section 1848(s) of the Act;

(iv) Submitted in response to the MIPS Call for Quality Measures under section 1848(q)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act; or

(v) Any other quality measures that CMS determines to have an evidence-based focus and to be reliable and valid.

(3) In addition to the quality measure requirements under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the quality measures upon which an Advanced APM bases the payment in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must include at least one outcome measure. This requirement does not apply if CMS determines that there are no available or applicable outcome measures included in the MIPS quality measures list for the Advanced APM's first QP Performance Period.

(c) *Financial risk.* To be an Advanced APM, an APM must either meet the financial risk standard under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section and the nominal amount standard under paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section or be an expanded Medical Home Model under Section 1115A(c) of the Act.

(1) *Generally applicable financial risk standard.* Except for paragraph (c)(2) of this section, to be an Advanced APM, an APM must, based on whether an APM Entity's actual expenditures for which the APM Entity is responsible under the APM exceed expected expenditures during a specified QP Performance Period, do one or more of the following:

(i) Withhold payment for services to the APM Entity or the APM Entity's eligible clinicians;

(ii) Reduce payment rates to the APM Entity or the APM Entity's eligible clinicians; or

(iii) Require the APM Entity to owe payment(s) to CMS.

(2) *Medical Home Model financial risk standard.* The APM Entity participates in a Medical Home Model that, based on the APM Entity's failure to meet or exceed one or more specified performance standards, which may include expected expenditures, does one or more of the following:

(i) Withholds payment for services to the APM Entity or the APM Entity's eligible clinicians;

(ii) Reduces payment rates to the APM Entity or the APM Entity's eligible clinicians;

(iii) Requires the APM Entity to owe payment(s) to CMS; or

(iv) Causes the APM Entity to lose the right to all or part of an otherwise guaranteed payment or payments.

(3) *Generally applicable nominal amount standard.* (i) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the total amount an APM Entity potentially owes CMS or foregoes under an APM must be at least equal to either:

(A) For QP Performance Periods 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, 8 percent of the average estimated total Medicare Parts A and B revenue of all providers and suppliers in participating APM Entities; or

(B) 3 percent of the expected expenditures for which an APM Entity is responsible under the APM.

(ii) [Reserved]

(4) *Medical Home Model nominal amount standard.* (i) For a Medical Home Model to meet the Medical Home Model nominal amount standard, the total annual amount that an APM Entity potentially owes CMS or foregoes must be at least the following amounts:

(A) For QP Performance Period 2017, 2.5 percent of the average estimated total Medicare Parts A and B revenue of all providers and suppliers in participating APM Entities.

(B) For QP Performance Period 2018, 2.5 percent of the average estimated total Medicare Parts A and B revenue of all providers and suppliers in participating APM Entities.

(C) For QP Performance Period 2019, 3 percent of the average estimated total Medicare Parts A and B revenue of all providers and suppliers in participating APM Entities.

(D) For QP Performance Period 2020, 4 percent of the average estimated total Medicare Parts A and B revenue of all providers and suppliers in participating APM Entities.

(E) For QP Performance Periods 2021 and later, 5 percent of the average estimated total Medicare Parts A and B revenue of all providers and suppliers in participating APM Entities.

(ii) [Reserved]

(5) *Expected expenditures.* For the purposes of this section, expected expenditures is defined as the beneficiary expenditures for which an APM Entity is responsible under an APM. For episode payment models, expected expenditures mean the episode target price.

(6) *Capitation.* A full capitation arrangement meets this Advanced APM criterion. For purposes of this part, a capitation arrangement means a payment arrangement in which a per capita or otherwise predetermined payment is made under the APM for all items and services for which payment is made through the APM furnished to a population of beneficiaries, and no settlement is performed to reconcile or share losses incurred or savings earned by the APM Entity. Arrangements between CMS and Medicare Advantage Organizations under the Medicare Advantage program (42 U.S.C. 422) are not considered capitation arrangements for purposes of this paragraph.

(7) *Medical Home Model 50 eligible clinician limit.* Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(2) and (4) of this section, beginning in the 2018 QP Performance Period, if an APM Entity participating in a Medical Home Model other than Round 1 of the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+) Model is owned and operated by an organization with 50 or more eligible clinicians whose Medicare billing rights have been reassigned to the TIN(s) of the organization(s) or any of the organization's subsidiary entities, the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(3) of this section apply.
