##### § 414.1365 MIPS Value Pathways. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 70227, Nov. 18, 2022.

(a) *General.* (1) Beginning with the CY 2023 MIPS performance period/2025 MIPS payment year, CMS uses MVPs included in the MIPS final inventory of MVPs established by CMS through rulemaking to assess performance for the quality, cost, improvement activities, and Promoting Interoperability performance categories.

(2) [Reserved]

(b) *MVP/Subgroup registration.* (1) To report an MVP, an MVP Participant must register for the MVP, and if applicable, as a subgroup during a period that begins on April 1 and ends on November 30 of the applicable CY performance period or a later date specified by CMS. To report the CAHPS for MIPS survey associated with an MVP, a group, subgroup or APM Entity must complete their registration by June 30 of such performance period or a later date specified by CMS.

(2) At the time of registration, the MVP Participant must submit the following information, as applicable:

(i) Each MVP Participant must select an MVP, 1 population health measure included in the MVP, and any outcomes-based administrative claims measure on which the MVP Participant intends to be scored.

(ii) Each subgroup must submit a list of each TIN/NPI associated with the subgroup and a plain language name for the subgroup.

(c) *MVP reporting requirement*s - (1) Quality. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, an MVP Participant must select and report, if applicable, 4 quality measures, including 1 outcome measure (or, if an outcome measure is not available, 1 high priority measure), included in the MVP, excluding the population health measure required under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section.

(i) Paragraph (c)(1) introductory text of this section does not apply to a small practice that reports on an MVP that includes fewer than 4 Medicare Part B claims measures, provided that the small practice reports each such measure that is applicable.

(ii) [Reserved]

(2) *Cost.* An MVP Participant is scored on the cost measures included in the MVP that they select and report.

(3) *Improvement activities.* An MVP Participant who reports an MVP, must report one of the following:

(i) Two medium-weighted improvement activities;

(ii) One high-weighted improvement activity;

(iii) Participation in a certified or recognized patient-centered medical home (PCMH) or comparable specialty practice, as described at § 414.1380(b)(3)(ii).

(4) *Foundational layer* - (i) Promoting interoperability. An MVP Participant is required to meet the Promoting Interoperability performance category reporting requirements described at § 414.1375(b).

(A) For the CY 2023 and 2024 performance periods/2025 and 2026 MIPS payment years, an MVP Participant that is a subgroup is required to submit its affiliated group's data for the Promoting Interoperability performance category.

(B) [Reserved]

(ii) *Population health measures.* Each MVP Participant is scored on 1 population health measure in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section.

(d) *MVP scoring* - (1) General. An MVP Participant that is not an APM Entity is scored on measures and activities included in the MVP in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this section. An MVP Participant that is an APM Entity is scored on measures and activities included in the MVP in accordance with § 414.1317(b).

(2) *Performance standards.* Unless otherwise indicated in this paragraph (d), the performance standards described at § 414.1380(a)(1)(i) through (iv) apply to the measures and activities included in the MVP.

(3) *Performance categories.* An MVP Participant is scored under MIPS in four performance categories.

(i) *Quality performance category.* Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3)(i)(A)(1) and (d)(3)(i)(B) of this section, the quality performance category score for MVP Participants is calculated in accordance with § 414.1380(b)(1) based on measures included in the MVP.

(A) *Population health measures.* Except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(i)(A)(*1*) of this section, each selected population health measure that does not have a benchmark or meet the case minimum requirement is excluded from the MVP participant's total measure achievement points and total available measure achievement points.

(*1*) Subgroups are scored on each selected population health measure that does not have a benchmark or meet the case minimum requirement based on their affiliated group score, if available. If the subgroup's affiliated group score is not available, each such measure is excluded from the subgroup's total measure achievement points and total available measure achievement points.

(*2*) [Reserved]

(B) *Outcomes-based administrative claims measures.* MVP Participants receive zero measure achievement points for each selected outcomes-based administrative claims measure that does not have a benchmark or meet the case minimum requirement.

(ii) *Cost performance category.* The cost performance category score is calculated for an MVP Participant using the methodology at § 414.1380(b)(2)(i) through (v) and the cost measures included in the MVP that they select and report.

(iii) *Improvement activities performance category.* The improvement activities performance category score is calculated based on the submission of high- and medium-weighted improvement activities. MVP Participants will receive 20 points for each medium-weighted improvement activity and 40 points for each high-weighted improvement activity required under § 414.1360 on which data is submitted in accordance with § 414.1325 or for participation in a certified or recognized patient-centered medical home (PCMH) or comparable specialty practice, as described at § 414.1380(b)(3)(ii).

(iv) *Promoting interoperability performance category.* The Promoting Interoperability performance category score is calculated for an MVP Participant using the methodology at § 414.1380(b)(4), except as provided in paragraph (d)(3)(iv)(A) of this section.

(A) If a subgroup does not submit its affiliated group's data for the Promoting Interoperability performance category, the subgroup will receive a score of zero for the Promoting Interoperability performance category.

(B) [Reserved]

(e) *Final score calculation.* The final score is calculated for an MVP Participant using the methodology at § 414.1380(c), unless otherwise indicated in this paragraph (e).

(1) *MVP performance category weights.* For an MVP Participant that is not an APM Entity, the final score is calculated using the performance category weights described at § 414.1380(c)(1). For an MVP Participant that is an APM Entity, the final score is calculated using the performance category weights described at § 414.1317(b).

(2) *Reweighting MVP performance categories* - (i) General reweighting. For an MVP Participant that is not an APM Entity, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section, a scoring weight different from the weights described at § 414.1380(c)(1) will be assigned to a performance category, and its weight as described at § 414.1380(c)(1) will be redistributed to another performance category or categories, in the circumstances described at § 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(A)(2) through (9) and § 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(C). For an MVP Participant that is an APM Entity, the performance category weights will be redistributed in accordance with § 414.1317(b).

(ii) *Subgroups.* For an MVP Participant that is a subgroup, any reweighting applied to its affiliated group will also be applied to the subgroup. In addition, if reweighting is not applied to the affiliated group, the subgroup may receive reweighting in the following circumstances independent of the affiliated group:

(A) A subgroup may submit an application to CMS demonstrating that it was subject to extreme and uncontrollable circumstances and receive reweighting in accordance with § 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(A)(6) and (c)(2)(i)(C)(2). In the event that a subgroup submits data for a performance category, the scoring weight described at § 414.1380(c)(1) would be applied and its weight would not be redistributed.

(B) A subgroup will receive reweighting if CMS determines, based on information known to the agency prior to the beginning of the relevant MIPS payment year, that data for the subgroup are inaccurate, unusable or otherwise compromised due to circumstances outside of the control of the subgroup and its agents, in accordance with § 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(A)(9) and (c)(2)(i)(C)(10).

(iii) *Reweighting scenarios.* For an MVP Participant that is not an APM Entity, a scoring weight different from the weights described at § 414.1380(c)(1) will be assigned to a performance category, and its weight as described at § 414.1380(c)(1) will be redistributed to another performance category or categories, in accordance with § 414.1380(c)(2)(ii). For an MVP Participant that is an APM Entity, the performance category weights will be redistributed in accordance with § 414.1317(b).

(3) *Facility-based scoring.* If an MVP Participant, that is not an APM Entity, is eligible for facility-based scoring, a facility-based score also will be calculated in accordance with § 414.1380(e).

(4) *Complex patient bonus.* A complex patient bonus will be added to the final score for an MVP Participant in accordance with § 414.1380(c)(3).
