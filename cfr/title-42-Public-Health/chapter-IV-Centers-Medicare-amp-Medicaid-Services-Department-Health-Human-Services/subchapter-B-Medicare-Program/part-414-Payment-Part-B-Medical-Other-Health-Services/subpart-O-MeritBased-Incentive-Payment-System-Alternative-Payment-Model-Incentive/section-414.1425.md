##### § 414.1425 Qualifying APM participant determination: In general. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 53961, Nov. 16, 2017.

(a) *List used for QP determination.* (1) For Advanced APMs with Advanced APM Entities that include eligible clinicians on a Participation List, the Participation List defines the APM Entity group, regardless of whether the Advanced APM Entity also has eligible clinicians on an Affiliated Practitioner List.

(2) For Advanced APMs with Advanced APM Entities that do not include eligible clinicians on a Participation List but do include eligible clinicians on an Affiliated Practitioner List, the Affiliated Practitioner List defines the eligible clinicians who will be assessed to become QPs.

(3) For Advanced APMs with some Advanced APM Entities that include eligible clinicians on a Participation List and other Advanced APM Entities that only include eligible clinicians on an Affiliated Practitioner List, paragraph (a)(1) applies to APM Entities that include eligible clinicians on a Participation List, and paragraph (a)(2) applies to APM Entities that only include eligible clinicians on an Affiliated Practitioner List.

(b) *Group or individual determination* - (1) *APM Entity group determination.* Except for § 414.1445 and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for purposes of the QP determinations for a year, eligible clinicians are grouped and assessed through their collective participation in an APM Entity group that is in an Advanced APM. To be included in the APM Entity group for purposes of the QP determination, an eligible clinician's APM participant identifier must be present on a Participation List of an APM Entity group on one of the dates: March 31, June 30, or August 31 of the QP Performance Period. An eligible clinician included on a Participation List on any one of these dates is included the APM Entity group even if that eligible clinician is not included on that Participation List at one of the prior or later listed dates. CMS performs QP determinations for the eligible clinicians in APM Entity group three times during the QP Performance Period using claims data for services furnished from January 1 through each of the respective QP determination dates: March 31, June 30, and August 31. An eligible clinician can only be determined to be a QP if the eligible clinician appears on the Participation List on a date (March 31, June 30, or August 31) CMS uses to determine the APM Entity group and to make QP determinations collectively for the APM Entity group based on participation in the Advanced APM.

(2) *Affiliated practitioner individual determination.* When the Affiliated Practitioner List defines the eligible clinicians to be assessed, for purposes of the QP determinations for a year, those eligible clinicians are assessed individually. To be assessed as an Affiliated Practitioner, an eligible clinician must be identified on an Affiliated Practitioner List on one of the dates: March 31, June 30, or August 31 of the QP Performance Period. An eligible clinician included on an Affiliated Practitioner List on any one of these dates is assessed as an Affiliated Practitioner even if that eligible clinician is not included on that Affiliated Practitioner List at one of the prior or later listed dates. For such eligible clinicians, CMS performs QP determinations during the QP Performance Period using claims data for services furnished from January 1 through each of the respective QP determination dates that the eligible clinician is on the Affiliated Practitioner List: March 31, June 30, and August 31.

(c) *QP determination.* (1) CMS makes QP determinations as set forth in §§ 414.1435 and 414.1440.

(2) An eligible clinician cannot be both a QP and a Partial QP for a year. A determination that an eligible clinician is a QP means that the eligible clinician is not a Partial QP.

(3) An eligible clinician is a QP for a year if the eligible clinician is in an APM Entity group that achieves a Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the corresponding QP payment amount threshold or QP patient count threshold for that QP Performance Period, as described in § 414.1430(a)(1) and (3) and (b)(1) and (3).

(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an eligible clinician is a QP for a year if:

(i) The eligible clinician is included in more than one Advanced APM Entity group and none of the Advanced APM Entity groups in which the eligible clinician is included meets the QP payment amount threshold or the QP patient count threshold, or the eligible clinician is an Affiliated Practitioner; and

(ii) CMS determines that the eligible clinician individually achieves a Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the QP payment amount threshold or the QP patient count threshold.

(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, an eligible clinician is not a QP for a year if the APM Entity group voluntarily or involuntarily terminates from an Advanced APM before the end of the QP Performance Period.

(6) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(4) of this section, an eligible clinician is not a QP for a year if any of the Advanced APM Entities in which the eligible clinician participates voluntarily or involuntarily terminates from the Advanced APM before the end of the QP Performance Period.

(d) *Partial QP determination.* (1) An eligible clinician is a Partial QP for a year if the APM Entity group collectively achieves a Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the corresponding Partial QP threshold for that year, as described in § 414.1430(a)(2) and (4) and (b)(2) and (4).

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an eligible clinician is a Partial QP for a year if:

(i) The eligible clinician is included in more than one APM Entity group and none of the APM Entity groups in which the eligible clinician is included meets the corresponding QP or Partial QP threshold, or the eligible clinician is an Affiliated Practitioner; and

(ii) CMS determines that the eligible clinician individually achieves a Threshold Score that meets or exceeds the corresponding Partial QP Threshold.

(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(1) of this section, an eligible clinician is not a Partial QP for a year if the APM Entity group voluntarily or involuntarily terminates from an Advanced APM before the end of the QP Performance Period.

(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an eligible clinician is not a Partial QP for a year if any of the Advanced APM Entities in which the eligible clinician participates voluntarily or involuntarily terminates from the Advanced APM before the end of the QP Performance Period.

(e) *Notification of QP determination.* CMS notifies eligible clinicians determined to be QPs or Partial QPs for a year as soon as practicable following each QP determination date in the QP Performance Period.

(f) *Order of threshold options.* (1) For payment years 2019 and 2020, CMS performs QP determinations for an eligible clinicians only under the Medicare Option described in § 414.1435.

(2) For payment years 2021 and later, CMS performs QP determinations for eligible clinicians under the Medicare Option, as described in § 414.1435 and, except as specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, the All-Payer Combination Option, described in § 414.1440.

(i) If CMS determines the eligible clinician to be a QP under the Medicare Option, then CMS does not calculate a Threshold Score for such eligible clinician under the All-Payer Combination Option.

(ii) If the Threshold Score for an eligible clinician under the Medicare Option is less than the amount specified in § 414.1430(b)(2)(ii) and (b)(3)(iii), then CMS does not perform a QP determination for such eligible clinician(s) under the All-Payer Combination Option.
