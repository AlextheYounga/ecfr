(iv) Once an election is made, the virtual group representative must contact their designated CMS contact to update any election information that changed during a performance period at least one time prior to the start of an applicable submission period.

(3) *Agreement.* The virtual group arrangement must be set forth in a written agreement among each solo practitioner and group that composes a virtual group. The agreement must comply with the following requirements:

(1) Individual eligible clinicians and individual MIPS eligible clinicians who are part of a TIN participating in MIPS at the virtual group level will have their performance assessed as a virtual group.

(2) Individual eligible clinicians and individual MIPS eligible clinicians who are part of a TIN participating in MIPS at the virtual group level must meet the definition of a virtual group at all times during the performance period for the MIPS payment year.

(3) Individual eligible clinicians and individual MIPS eligible clinicians who are part of a TIN participating in MIPS at the virtual group level must aggregate their performance data across multiple TINs in order for their performance to be assessed as a virtual group.
