##### ยง 414.1335 Data submission criteria for the quality performance category. #####

(a) *Criteria.* A MIPS eligible clinician or group must submit data on MIPS quality measures in one of the following manners, as applicable:

(1) *Via claims, qualified registry, EHR or QCDR submission mechanism.* For the performance period -

(i) Submit data on at least six measures including at least one outcome measure. If an applicable outcome measure is not available, report one other high priority measure (appropriate use, patient safety, efficiency, patient experience, and care coordination measures). If fewer than six measures apply to the MIPS eligible clinician or group, report on each measure that is applicable.

(ii) Subject to paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, MIPS eligible clinicians and groups can either select their measures from the complete MIPS final measure list or a subset of that list, MIPS specialty-specific measure sets, as designated by CMS.

(2) *Via the CMS Web Interface - for groups consisting of 25 or more eligible clinicians only.* (i) Report on all measures included in the CMS Web Interface. The group must report on the first 248 consecutively ranked beneficiaries in the sample for each measure or module.

(ii) If the sample of eligible assigned beneficiaries is less than 248, then the group must report on 100 percent of assigned beneficiaries. In some instances, the sampling methodology will not be able to assign at least 248 patients on which a group may report, particularly those groups on the smaller end of the range of 25-99 MIPS eligible clinicians.

(iii) The group is required to report on at least one measure for which there is Medicare patient data.

(iv) Groups reporting via the CMS Web Interface are required to report on all of the measures in the set.

(3) *Via CMS-approved survey vendor for CAHPS for MIPS survey- for groups only.* (i) For the 12-month performance period, a group that wishes to voluntarily elect to participate in the CAHPS for MIPS survey measures must use a survey vendor that is approved by CMS for a particular performance period to transmit survey measures data to CMS.

(A) The CAHPS for MIPS survey counts for one measure towards the MIPS quality performance category and, as a patient experience measure, also fulfills the requirement to report at least one high priority measure in the absence of an applicable outcome measure.

(B) Groups that elect this data submission mechanism must select an additional group data submission mechanism in order to meet the data submission criteria for the MIPS quality performance category.

(ii) [Reserved]

(b) [Reserved]
