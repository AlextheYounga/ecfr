##### § 414.1400 Third party intermediaries. #####

(a) *General.* (1) MIPS data may be submitted on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician, group, or virtual group by any of the following third party intermediaries:

(i) A QCDR;

(ii) A qualified registry;

(iii) A health IT vendor; or

(iv) A CMS-approved survey vendor.

(2) Beginning with the 2023 MIPS payment year, QCDRs and qualified registries must be able to submit data for all of the following MIPS performance categories, and Health IT vendors must be able to submit data for at least one of the following MIPS performance categories:

(i) Quality, except for data on the CAHPS for MIPS survey;

(ii) Improvement activities; or

(iii) Promoting Interoperability, if the eligible clinician, group, or virtual group is using CEHRT; however, a third party intermediary may be excepted from this requirement if its MIPS eligible clinicians, groups or virtual groups fall under the reweighting policies at § 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(A)(*4*) or (*5*) or § 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(C)(*1*) through (*7*) or § 414.1380(c)(2)(i)(C)(*9*)).

(3) CMS-approved survey vendors may submit data on the CAHPS for MIPS survey for the MIPS quality performance category.

(4) To be approved as a third party intermediary, an entity must agree to meet the applicable requirements of this section, including, but not limited to, the following:

(i) A third party intermediary's principle place of business and retention of any data must be based in the U.S.

(ii) If the data is derived from CEHRT, a QCDR, qualified registry, or health IT vendor must be able to indicate its data source.

(iii) All data must be submitted in the form and manner specified by CMS.

(iv) If the clinician chooses to opt-in in accordance with § 414.1310, the third party intermediary must be able to transmit that decision to CMS.

(v) The third party intermediary must provide services throughout the entire performance period and applicable data submission period.

(vi) Prior to discontinuing services to any MIPS eligible clinician, group, or virtual group during a performance period, the third party intermediary must support the transition of such MIPS eligible clinician, group, or virtual group to an alternate third party intermediary, submitter type, or, for any measure on which data has been collected, collection type according to a CMS approved a transition plan.

(5) All data submitted to CMS by a third party intermediary on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician, group or virtual group must be certified by the third party intermediary as true, accurate, and complete to the best of its knowledge. Such certification must be made in a form and manner and at such time as specified by CMS.

(b) *QCDR approval criteria* - (1) *QCDR self-nomination.* For the 2020 and 2021 MIPS payment years, entities seeking to qualify as a QCDR must self-nominate September 1 until November 1 of the CY preceding the applicable performance period. For the 2022 MIPS payment year and future years, entities seeking to qualify as a QCDR must self-nominate during a 60-day period during the CY preceding the applicable performance period (beginning no earlier than July 1 and ending no later than September 1). Entities seeking to qualify as a QCDR for a performance period must provide all information required by CMS at the time of self-nomination and must provide any additional information requested by CMS during the review process. For the 2021 MIPS payment year and future years, existing QCDRs that are in good standing may attest that certain aspects of their previous year's approved self-nomination have not changed and will be used for the applicable performance period. Beginning with the 2023 payment year, QCDRs are required to attest during the self-nomination process that they can provide performance feedback at least 4 times a year (as specified at paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section), and if not, provide sufficient rationale as to why they do not believe they would be able to meet this requirement. Each QCDR would still be required to submit notification to CMS within the reporting period promptly within the month of realization of the impending deficiency in order to be considered for this exception, as discussed at paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.

(2) *Establishment of a QCDR entity.* (i) Beginning with the 2022 MIPS Payment Year, the QCDR must have at least 25 participants by January 1 of the year prior to the applicable performance period.

(ii) If the entity uses an external organization for purposes of data collection, calculation, or transmission, it must have a signed, written agreement with the external organization that specifically details the responsibilities of the entity and the external organization. The written agreement must be effective as of September 1 of the year preceding the applicable performance period.

(iii) Beginning with the 2023 MIPS payment year, require QCDRs to provide performance feedback to their clinicians and groups at least 4 times a year, and provide specific feedback to their clinicians and groups on how they compare to other clinicians who have submitted data on a given measure within the QCDR. Exceptions to this requirement may occur if the QCDR does not receive the data from their clinician until the end of the performance period.

(3) *QCDR measures for the quality performance category.* (i) For purposes of QCDRs submitting data for the MIPS quality performance category, CMS considers the following types of quality measures to be QCDR measures:

(A) Measures that are not included in the MIPS final list of quality measures described in § 414.1330(a)(1) for the applicable MIPS payment year; and

(B) Measures that are included in the MIPS final list of quality measures described in § 414.1330(a)(1) for the applicable MIPS payment year, but have undergone substantive changes, as determined by CMS.

(ii) For the 2020 MIPS payment year and future years, an entity seeking to become a QCDR must submit specifications for each measure, activity, and objective that the entity intends to submit to for MIPS (including the information described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section) at the time of self-nomination. In addition, no later than 15 calendar days following CMS approval of any QCDR measure specifications, the entity must publicly post the measure specifications for each QCDR measure (including the CMS-assigned QCDR measure ID) and provide CMS with a link to where this information is posted.

(A) For QCDR measures, the entity must submit the measure specifications for each QCDR measure, including: Name/title of measures, NQF number (if NQF-endorsed), descriptions of the denominator, numerator, and when applicable, denominator exceptions, denominator exclusions, risk adjustment variables, and risk adjustment algorithms.

(B) For MIPS quality measures, the entity must submit the MIPS measure IDs and specialty-specific measure sets, as applicable.

(iii) A QCDR must include the CMS-assigned QCDR measure ID when submitting data on any QCDR measure to CMS.

(iv) QCDR measure considerations for approval include:

(A) Preference for measures that are outcome-based rather than clinical process measures.

(B) Measures that address patient safety and adverse events.

(C) Measures that identify appropriate use of diagnosis and therapeutics.

(D) Measures that address the domain of care coordination.

(E) Measures that address the domain for patient and caregiver experience.

(F) Measures that address efficiency, cost, and resource use.

(G) Beginning with the 2021 performance period -

(*1*) That QCDRs link their QCDR measures as feasible to at least one of the following at the time of self-nomination:

(*i*) Cost measure;

(*ii*) Improvement activity; or

(*iii*) An MVP.

(*2*) In cases where a QCDR measure does not have a clear link to a cost measure, improvement activity, or an MVP, we would consider exceptions if the potential QCDR measure otherwise meets the QCDR measure requirements and considerations.

(H) Beginning with the 2020 performance period CMS may consider the extent to which a QCDR measure is available to MIPS eligible clinicians reporting through QCDRs other than the QCDR measure owner for purposes of MIPS. If CMS determines that a QCDR measure is not available to MIPS eligible clinicians, groups, and virtual groups reporting through other QCDRs, CMS may not approve the measure.

(I) We give greater consideration to measures for which QCDRs:

(*1*) Conducted an environmental scan of existing QCDR measures; MIPS quality measures; quality measures retired from the legacy Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) program; and

(*2*) Utilized the CMS Quality Measure Development Plan Annual Report and the Blueprint for the CMS Measures Management System to identify measurement gaps prior to measure development.

(J) Beginning with the 2020 performance period, we place greater preference on QCDR measures that meet case minimum and reporting volumes required for benchmarking after being in the program for 2 consecutive CY performance periods. Those that do not, may not continue to be approved.

(*1*) Beginning with the 2020 performance period, in instances where a QCDR believes the low-reported QCDR measure that did not meet benchmarking thresholds is still important and relevant to a specialist's practice, that the QCDR may develop and submit a QCDR measure participation plan for our consideration. This QCDR measure participation plan must include the QCDR's detailed plans and changes to encourage eligible clinicians and groups to submit data on the low-reported QCDR measure for purposes of the MIPS program.

(*2*) [Reserved]

(v) QCDR measure requirements for approval include:

(A) QCDR Measures that are beyond the measure concept phase of development.

(B) QCDR Measures that address significant variation in performance.

(C) Beginning with the 2021 performance period, all QCDR measures must be fully developed and tested, with complete testing results at the clinician level, prior to submitting the QCDR measure at the time of self-nomination.

(D) Beginning with the 2021 performance period, QCDRs are required to collect data on a QCDR measure, appropriate to the measure type, prior to submitting the QCDR measure for CMS consideration during the self-nomination period.

(E) Beginning with the 2022 MIPS payment year, CMS may provisionally approve the individual QCDR measures for 1 year with the condition that QCDRs address certain areas of duplication with other approved QCDR measures in order to be considered for the program in subsequent years. If the QCDR measures are not harmonized, CMS may reject the duplicative QCDR measure.

(vi) Beginning with the 2021 performance period, QCDR measures may be approved for 2 years, at CMS discretion, by attaining approval status by meeting QCDR measure considerations and requirements. Upon annual review, CMS may revoke QCDR measure second year approval, if the QCDR measure is found to be: Topped out; duplicative of a more robust measure; reflects an outdated clinical guideline; requires QCDR measure harmonization; or if the QCDR self-nominating the QCDR measure is no longer in good standing.

(vii) Beginning with the 2020 performance period, QCDR measure rejection criteria considerations include, but are not limited to, the following factors:

(A) QCDR measures that are duplicative, or identical to other QCDR measures or MIPS quality measures that are currently in the program.

(B) QCDR measures that are duplicative or identical to MIPS quality measures that have been removed from MIPS through rulemaking.

(C) QCDR measures that are duplicative or identical to quality measures used under the legacy Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS) program, which have been retired.

(D) QCDR measures that meet the topped out definition as described at § 414.1305.

(E) QCDR measures that are process-based, with consideration to whether the removal of the process measure impacts the number of measures available for a specific specialty.

(F) Whether the QCDR measure has potential unintended consequences to a patient's care.

(G) Considerations and evaluation of the measure's performance data, to determine whether performance variance exists.

(H) Whether the previously identified areas of duplication have been addressed as requested.

(I) QCDR measures that split a single clinical practice or action into several QCDR measures.

(J) QCDR measures that are “check-box” with no actionable quality action.

(K) QCDR measures that do not meet the case minimum and reporting volumes required for benchmarking after being in the program for 2 consecutive years.

(L) Whether the existing approved QCDR measure is no longer considered robust, in instances where new QCDR measures are considered to have a more vigorous quality actions, where CMS preference is to include the new QCDR measure rather than requesting QCDR measure harmonization.

(M) QCDR measures with clinician attribution issues, where the quality action is not under the direct control of the reporting clinician.

(N) QCDR measures that focus on rare events or “never events” in the measurement period.

(c) *Qualified registry approval criteria* - (1) *Qualified registry self-nomination.* For the 2020 and 2021 MIPS payment years, entities seeking to qualify as a qualified registry must self-nominate from September 1 until November 1 of the CY preceding the applicable performance period. For the 2022 MIPS payment year and future years, entities seeking to qualify as a qualified registry must self-nominate during a 60-day period during the CY preceding the applicable performance period (beginning no earlier than July 1 and ending no later than September 1). Entities seeking to qualify as a qualified registry for a performance period must provide all information required by CMS at the time of self-nomination and must provide any additional information requested by CMS during the review process. For the 2021 MIPS payment year and future years, existing qualified registries that are in good standing may attest that certain aspects of their previous year's approved self-nomination have not changed and will be used for the applicable performance period. Beginning with the 2023 payment year, qualified registries are required to attest during the self-nomination process that they can provide performance feedback at least 4 times a year (as specified at § 414.1400(c)(2)(ii)), and if not, provide sufficient rationale as to why they do not believe they would be able to meet this requirement. Each qualified registry would still be required to submit notification to CMS within the reporting period promptly within the month of realization of the impending deficiency in order to be considered for this exception, as discussed at § 414.1400(c)(2)(ii).

(2) *Establishment of a qualified registry entity.* Beginning with the 2022 MIPS Payment Year, the qualified registry must have at least 25 participants by January 1 of the year prior to the applicable performance period.

(i) Beginning with the 2022 MIPS Payment Year, the qualified registry must have at least 25 participants by January 1 of the year prior to the applicable performance period.

(ii) Beginning with the 2023 MIPS payment year, require qualified registries to provide performance feedback to their clinicians and groups at least 4 times a year, and provide specific feedback to their clinicians and groups on how they compare to other clinicians who have submitted data on a given measure within the qualified registries. Exceptions to this requirement may occur if the qualified registries does not receive the data from their clinician until the end of the performance period.

(d) *Health IT vendor approval criteria.* Health IT vendors must meet the criteria specified at paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(e) *CMS-approved survey vendor approval criteria.* Entities seeking to be a CMS-approved survey vendor for any MIPS performance period must submit a survey vendor application to CMS in a form and manner specified by CMS for each MIPS performance period for which it wishes to transmit such data. The application and any supplemental information requested by CMS must be submitted by deadlines specified by CMS. For an entity to be a CMS-approved survey vendor, it must meet the following criteria:

(1) The entity must have sufficient experience, capability, and capacity to accurately report CAHPS data, including:

(ii) At least 3 years of experience administering surveys to a Medicare population;

(iii) At least 3 years of experience administering CAHPS surveys within the past 5 years;

(iv) Experience administering surveys in English and at least one other language for which a translation of the CAHPS for MIPS survey is available;

(v) Use equipment, software, computer programs, systems, and facilities that can verify addresses and phone numbers of sampled beneficiaries, monitor interviewers, collect data via CATI, electronically administer the survey and schedule call-backs to beneficiaries at varying times of the day and week, track fielded surveys, assign final disposition codes to reflect the outcome of data collection of each sampled case, and track cases from mail surveys through telephone follow-up activities; and

(vi) Employment of a program manager, information systems specialist, call center supervisor and mail center supervisor to administer the survey.

(2) The entity has certified that it has the ability to maintain and transmit quality data in a manner that preserves the security and integrity of the data.

(6) The entity has sent an interim survey data file to CMS that establishes the entity's ability to accurately report CAHPS data.

(f) *Remedial action and termination of third party intermediaries.*(1) If CMS determines that a third party intermediary has ceased to meet one or more of the applicable criteria for approval, has submitted a false certification under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, or has submitted data that are inaccurate, unusable, or otherwise compromised, CMS may take one or more of the following remedial actions after providing written notice to the third party intermediary:

(i) Require the third party intermediary to submit a corrective action plan (CAP) to CMS to address the identified deficiencies or data issue, including the actions it will take to prevent the deficiencies or data issues from recurring. The CAP must be submitted to CMS by a date specified by CMS.

(ii) Publicly disclose the entity's data error rate on the CMS website until the data error rate falls below 3 percent.

(2) CMS may immediately or with advance notice terminate the ability of a third party intermediary to submit MIPS data on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician, group, or virtual group for one or more of the following reasons:

(i) CMS has grounds to impose remedial action;

(ii) CMS has not received a CAP within the specified time period or the CAP is not accepted by CMS; or

(iii) The third party intermediary fails to correct the deficiencies or data errors by the date specified by CMS.

(3) For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, CMS may determine that submitted data are inaccurate, unusable, or otherwise compromised, including but not limited to, if the submitted data:
