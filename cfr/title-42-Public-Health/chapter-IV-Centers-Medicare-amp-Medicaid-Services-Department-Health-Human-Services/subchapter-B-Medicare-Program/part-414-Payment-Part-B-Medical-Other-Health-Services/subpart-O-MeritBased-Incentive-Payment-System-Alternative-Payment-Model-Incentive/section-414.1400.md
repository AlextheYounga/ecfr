##### § 414.1400 Third party data submission. #####

(a) *General.* (1) MIPS data may be submitted by third party intermediaries on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician, group or virtual group by:

(i) A qualified registry;

(ii) A QCDR;

(iii) A health IT vendor or other authorized third party that obtains data from a MIPS eligible clinician's CEHRT; or

(iv) A CMS-approved survey vendor.

(2) Qualified registries, QCDRs, and health IT vendors or other authorized third parties may submit data on measures, activities, or objectives for any of the following MIPS performance categories:

(i) Quality;

(ii) Improvement activities; or

(iii) Advancing care information, if the MIPS eligible clinician or group is using CEHRT.

(3) CMS-approved survey vendors may submit data for the CAHPS for MIPS survey under the MIPS quality performance category.

(4) Third party intermediaries must meet all the criteria specified by CMS to qualify and be approved as a third party intermediary for purposes of MIPS, including, but not limited to, the following criteria:

(i) For measures, activities, and objectives under the quality, advancing care information, and improvement activities performance categories, if the data is derived from CEHRT, the QCDR, qualified registry, or health IT vendor must be able to indicate its data source.

(ii) All submitted data must be submitted in the form and manner specified by CMS.

(5) All data submitted to CMS by a third party intermediary on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician, group or virtual group must be certified by the third party intermediary to the best of its knowledge as true, accurate, and complete. Such certification must accompany the submission and be made at the time of the submission.

(b) *QCDR self-nomination criteria.* For the 2018 performance period and future years of the program, QCDRs must self-nominate from September 1 of the prior year until November 1 of the prior year. Entities that desire to qualify as a QCDR for the purposes of MIPS for a given performance period will need to self-nominate for that performance period and provide all information requested by CMS at the time of self-nomination. Having qualified as a QCDR does not automatically qualify the entity to participate in subsequent MIPS performance periods. Beginning with the 2019 performance period existing QCDRs that are in good standing may attest that certain aspects of their previous year's approved self-nomination have not changed and will be used for the upcoming performance period. CMS may allow existing QCDRs in good standing to submit minimal or substantial changes to their previously approved self-nomination form, from the previous year, during the annual self-nomination period, for CMS review and approval without having to complete the entire QCDR self-nomination application process.

(c) *Establishment of a QCDR entity.* For an entity to become qualified for a given performance period as a QCDR, the entity must:

(1) Be in existence as of January 1 of the performance period for which the entity seeks to become a QCDR.

(2) Have at least 25 participants by January 1 of the performance period.

(d) *Collaboration of entities to become a QCDR.* In situations where an entity may not meet the criteria of a QCDR solely on its own but can do so in conjunction with another entity, the entity must also comply with the following:

(1) An entity that uses an external organization for purposes of data collection, calculation, or transmission may meet the definition of a QCDR as long as the entity has a signed, written agreement that specifically details the relationship and responsibilities of the entity with the external organization effective as of September 1 the year prior to the year for which the entity seeks to become a QCDR.

(2) [Reserved]

(e) *Identifying QCDR quality measures.* Beginning with the 2018 performance period and for future program years, the term “non-MIPS measures” will be replaced with the term “QCDR measures”. For purposes of QCDRs submitting data for the MIPS quality performance category, CMS considers the following types of quality measures to be QCDR quality measures:

(1) A measure that is not contained in the annual list of MIPS quality measures for the applicable performance period.

(2) A measure that may be in the annual list of MIPS quality measures but has substantive differences, as determined by the Secretary, in the manner it is reported by the QCDR.

(3) CAHPS for MIPS survey. Although the CAHPS for MIPS survey is included in the MIPS measure set, we consider the changes that need to be made to the CAHPS for MIPS survey for reporting by individual MIPS eligible clinicians (and not as a part of a group) significant enough as to treat the CAHPS for MIPS survey as a QCDR quality measure for purposes of individual MIPS eligible clinicians reporting the CAHPS for MIPS survey via a QCDR.

(f) *QCDR measure specifications criteria.* A QCDR must provide specifications for each measure, activity, or objective the QCDR intends to submit to CMS. The QCDR must provide CMS descriptions and narrative specifications for each measure, activity, or objective no later than November 1 of the applicable performance period for which the QCDR wishes to submit quality measures or other performance category (improvement activities and advancing care information) data starting with the 2018 performance period and in future program years.

(1) For QCDR quality measures, the quality measure specifications must include the following for each measure: Name/title of measures, NQF number (if NQF-endorsed), descriptions of the denominator, numerator, and when applicable, denominator exceptions, denominator exclusions, risk adjustment variables, and risk adjustment algorithms. The narrative specifications provided must be similar to the narrative specifications we provide in our measures list.

(2) For MIPS quality measures, the QCDR only needs to submit the MIPS measure numbers or specialty-specific measure sets (if applicable). CMS expects that QCDRs reporting on MIPS measures, retain and use the MIPS measure specifications as they exist under the program year.

(3) The QCDR must publicly post the measure specifications no later than 15 calendar days following CMS approval of the measure specifications for each QCDR measure it intends to submit for MIPS. The QCDR may use any public format it prefers. Immediately following the posting of the measure specification, the QCDR must provide CMS with the link to where this information is posted.

(g) *Qualified registry self-nomination criteria.* For the 2018 performance period and future years of the program, the qualified registry must self-nominate from September 1 of the prior year until November 1 of the prior year. Entities that desire to qualify as a qualified registry for a given performance period must self-nominate and provide all information requested by CMS at the time of self-nomination. Having qualified as a qualified registry does not automatically qualify the entity to participate in subsequent MIPS performance periods. Beginning with the 2019 performance period, existing qualified registries that are in good standing may attest that certain aspects of their previous year's approved self-nomination have not changed and will be used for the upcoming performance period. CMS may allow existing qualified registries in good standing to submit minimal or substantive changes to their previously approved self-nomination form from the previous year, during the annual self-nomination period, for CMS review and approval without having to complete the entire qualified registry self-nomination application process.

(h) *Establishment of a qualified registry entity.* For an entity to become qualified for a given performance period as a qualified registry, the entity must:

(1) Be in existence as of January 1 of the performance period for which the entity seeks to become a qualified registry.

(2) Have at least 25 participants by January 1 of the performance period.

(i) *CMS-approved survey vendor application criteria.* Vendors are required to undergo the CMS approval process for each year in which the survey vendor seeks to transmit survey measures data to CMS. Applicants must adhere to any deadlines specified by CMS.

(j) *Auditing of entities submitting MIPS data.* Any third party intermediary (that is, a QCDR, health IT vendor, qualified registry, or CMS-approved survey vendor) must comply with the following procedures as a condition of their qualification and approval to participate in MIPS as a third party intermediary.

(1) The entity must make available to CMS the contact information of each MIPS eligible clinician or group on behalf of whom it submits data. The contact information will include, at a minimum, the MIPS eligible clinician or group's practice phone number, address, and, if available, email.

(2) The entity must retain all data submitted to CMS for purposes of MIPS for 6 years from the end of the MIPS performance period.

(3) For the purposes of auditing, CMS may request any records or data retained for the purposes of MIPS for up to 6 years from the end of the MIPS performance period.

(k) *Probation and disqualification of a third party intermediary.* (1) If at any time we determine that a third party intermediary (that is, a QCDR, health IT vendor, qualified registry, or CMS-approved survey vendor) has not met all of the applicable criteria for qualification and approval, CMS may place the third party intermediary on probation for the current performance period or the following performance period, as applicable.

(2) For purposes of this section, probation means that, for the applicable performance period, the third party intermediary must meet all applicable criteria for qualification and approval and must submit a corrective action plan for remediation or correction of any deficiencies identified by CMS that resulted in the probation.

(3) CMS requires a corrective action plan from the third party intermediary to address any deficiencies or issues and prevent them from recurring. The corrective action plan must be received and accepted by CMS within 14 days of the CMS notification to the third party intermediary of the deficiency or probation. If the corrective action plan is not received and accepted by CMS within the specified time, CMS may disqualify the third party intermediary from the MIPS program for the subsequent performance period.

(4) If the third party intermediary has data inaccuracies including (but not limited to) TIN/NPI mismatches, formatting issues, calculation errors, data audit discrepancies affecting in excess of 3 percent (but less than 5 percent) of the total number of MIPS eligible clinicians or groups submitted by the third party intermediary, such inaccuracies will trigger paragraph (k)(3) of this section and may result in this information being posted on the CMS Web site.

(5) If the third party intermediary does not reduce their data error rate below 3 percent for the subsequent performance period, the third party intermediary will continue to be on probation and have their listing on the CMS Web site continue to note the poor quality of the data they are submitting for MIPS for one additional year. After 2 years on probation, the third party intermediary will be disqualified for the subsequent performance period.

(6) Before placing the third party intermediary on probation; CMS would notify the third party intermediary of the identified issues, at the time of discovery of such issues.

(7) If the third party intermediary does not submit an acceptable corrective action plan within 14 days of notification of deficiencies, and correct the deficiencies within 30 days or before the submission deadline - whichever is sooner, CMS may disqualify the third party intermediary from participating in MIPS for the current performance period or the following performance period, as applicable.
