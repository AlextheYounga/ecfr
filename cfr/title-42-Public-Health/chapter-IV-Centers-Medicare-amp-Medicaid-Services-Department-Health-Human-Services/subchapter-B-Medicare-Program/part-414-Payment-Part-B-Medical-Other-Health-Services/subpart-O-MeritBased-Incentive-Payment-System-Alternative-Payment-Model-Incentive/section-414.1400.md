(i) A QCDR;

(ii) A qualified registry;

(iii) A health IT vendor; or

(iv) A CMS-approved survey vendor.

(2) QCDRs, qualified registries, and health IT vendors may submit MIPS data for any of the following MIPS performance categories:

(i) Quality, except for data on the CAHPS for MIPS survey;

(ii) Improvement activities; or

(iii) Promoting Interoperability, if the MIPS eligible clinician, group, or virtual group is using CEHRT.

(3) CMS-approved survey vendors may submit data on the CAHPS for MIPS survey for the MIPS quality performance category.

(4) To be approved as a third party intermediary, an entity must agree to meet the applicable requirements of this section, including, but not limited to, the following:

(i) A third party intermediary's principle place of business and retention of any data must be based in the U.S.

(ii) If the data is derived from CEHRT, a QCDR, qualified registry, or health IT vendor must be able to indicate its data source.

(iii) All data must be submitted in the form and manner specified by CMS.

(iv) If the clinician chooses to opt-in in accordance with ยง 414.1310, the third party intermediary must be able to transmit that decision to CMS.

(5) All data submitted to CMS by a third party intermediary on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician, group or virtual group must be certified by the third party intermediary as true, accurate, and complete to the best of its knowledge. Such certification must be made in a form and manner and at such time as specified by CMS.

(b) *QCDR approval criteria* - (1) *QCDR self-nomination.* For the 2020 and 2021 MIPS payment years, entities seeking to qualify as a QCDR must self-nominate September 1 until November 1 of the CY preceding the applicable performance period. For the 2022 MIPS payment year and future years, entities seeking to qualify as a QCDR must self-nominate during a 60-day period during the CY preceding the applicable performance period (beginning no earlier than July 1 and ending no later than September 1). Entities seeking to qualify as a QCDR for a performance period must provide all information required by CMS at the time of self-nomination and must provide any additional information requested by CMS during the review process. For the 2021 MIPS payment year and future years, existing QCDRs that are in good standing may attest that certain aspects of their previous year's approved self-nomination have not changed and will be used for the applicable performance period.

(2) *Establishment of a QCDR entity.* (i) Beginning with the 2022 MIPS Payment Year, the QCDR must have at least 25 participants by January 1 of the year prior to the applicable performance period.

(ii) If the entity uses an external organization for purposes of data collection, calculation, or transmission, it must have a signed, written agreement with the external organization that specifically details the responsibilities of the entity and the external organization. The written agreement must be effective as of September 1 of the year preceding the applicable performance period.

(3) *QCDR measures for the quality performance category.* (i) For purposes of QCDRs submitting data for the MIPS quality performance category, CMS considers the following types of quality measures to be QCDR measures:

(A) Measures that are not included in the MIPS final list of quality measures described in ยง 414.1330(a)(1) for the applicable MIPS payment year; and

(B) Measures that are included in the MIPS final list of quality measures described in ยง 414.1330(a)(1) for the applicable MIPS payment year, but have undergone substantive changes, as determined by CMS.

(ii) For the 2020 MIPS payment year and future years, an entity seeking to become a QCDR must submit specifications for each measure, activity, and objective that the entity intends to submit to for MIPS (including the information described in paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section) at the time of self-nomination. In addition, no later than 15 calendar days following CMS approval of any QCDR measure specifications, the entity must publicly post the measure specifications for each QCDR measure (including the CMS-assigned QCDR measure ID) and provide CMS with a link to where this information is posted.

(A) For QCDR measures, the entity must submit the measure specifications for each QCDR measure, including: Name/title of measures, NQF number (if NQF-endorsed), descriptions of the denominator, numerator, and when applicable, denominator exceptions, denominator exclusions, risk adjustment variables, and risk adjustment algorithms.

(B) For MIPS quality measures, the entity must submit the MIPS measure IDs and specialty-specific measure sets, as applicable.

(iii) A QCDR must include the CMS-assigned QCDR measure ID when submitting data on any QCDR measure to CMS.

(c) *Qualified registry approval criteria* - (1) *Qualified registry self-nomination.* For the 2020 and 2021 MIPS payment years, entities seeking to qualify as a qualified registry must self-nominate from September 1 until November 1 of the CY preceding the applicable performance period. For the 2022 MIPS payment year and future years, entities seeking to qualify as a qualified registry must self-nominate during a 60-day period during the CY preceding the applicable performance period (beginning no earlier than July 1 and ending no later than September 1). Entities seeking to qualify as a qualified registry for a performance period must provide all information required by CMS at the time of self-nomination and must provide any additional information requested by CMS during the review process. For the 2021 MIPS payment year and future years, existing qualified registries that are in good standing may attest that certain aspects of their previous year's approved self-nomination have not changed and will be used for the applicable performance period.

(2) *Establishment of a qualified registry entity.* Beginning with the 2022 MIPS Payment Year, the qualified registry must have at least 25 participants by January 1 of the year prior to the applicable performance period.

(d) *Health IT vendor approval criteria.* Health IT vendors must meet the criteria specified at paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(e) *CMS-approved survey vendor approval criteria.* Entities seeking to be a CMS-approved survey vendor for any MIPS performance period must submit a survey vendor application to CMS in a form and manner specified by CMS for each MIPS performance period for which it wishes to transmit such data. The application and any supplemental information requested by CMS must be submitted by deadlines specified by CMS. For an entity to be a CMS-approved survey vendor, it must meet the following criteria:

(1) The entity must have sufficient experience, capability, and capacity to accurately report CAHPS data, including:
