(ii) [Reserved]

(2) A group must meet the definition of a group at all times during the performance period for the MIPS payment year in order to have its performance assessed as a group.

(3) Eligible clinicians and MIPS eligible clinicians within a group must aggregate their performance data across the TIN in order for their performance to be assessed as a group.

(4) A group that elects to have its performance assessed as a group will be assessed as a group across all four MIPS performance categories.
