(a) *Data submission performance categories.* MIPS eligible clinicians and groups must submit measures, objectives, and activities for the quality, improvement activities, and advancing care information performance categories.

(b) *Data submission mechanisms for individual eligible clinicians.* An individual MIPS eligible clinician may elect to submit their MIPS data using:

(1) A qualified registry for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(2) The EHR submission mechanism (which includes submission of data by health IT vendors or other authorized providers on behalf of MIPS eligible clinicians) for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(3) A QCDR for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(4) Medicare Part B claims for the quality performance category; or

(5) Attestation for the improvement activities and advancing care information performance categories.

(c) *Data submission mechanisms for groups that are not reporting through an APM.* Groups may submit their MIPS data using:

(1) A qualified registry for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(2) The EHR submission mechanism (which includes the submission of data by health IT vendors on behalf of groups) for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(3) A QCDR for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(4) A CMS Web Interface (for groups comprised of at least 25 MIPS eligible clinicians) for the quality, improvement activities, and advancing care information performance categories;

(5) Attestation for the improvement activities and advancing care information performance categories; or

(6) A CMS-approved survey vendor for groups that elect to include the CAHPS for MIPS survey as a quality measure. Groups that elect to include the CAHPS for MIPS survey as a quality measure must select one of the above data submission mechanisms to submit their other quality information.

(d) *Requirement to use only one submission mechanism per performance category.* Except as described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section, MIPS eligible clinicians and groups may elect to submit information via multiple mechanisms; however, they must use the same identifier for all performance categories and they may only use one submission mechanism per performance category.

(e) *No data submission requirements for the cost performance category and certain quality measures.* There are no data submission requirements for the cost performance category and for certain quality measures used to assess performance in the quality performance category. CMS will calculate performance on these measures using administrative claims data.

(f) *Data submission deadlines for all submission mechanisms for individual eligible clinicians and groups for all performance categories.* The submission deadlines are:

(1) For the qualified registry, QCDR, EHR, and attestation submission mechanisms are March 31 following the close of the performance period.

(2) For Medicare Part B claims, data must be submitted on claims with dates of service during the performance period that must be processed no later than 60 days following the close of the performance period.

(3) For the CMS Web Interface, data must be submitted during an 8-week period following the close of the performance period. The period must begin no earlier than January 2 and end no later than March 31.
