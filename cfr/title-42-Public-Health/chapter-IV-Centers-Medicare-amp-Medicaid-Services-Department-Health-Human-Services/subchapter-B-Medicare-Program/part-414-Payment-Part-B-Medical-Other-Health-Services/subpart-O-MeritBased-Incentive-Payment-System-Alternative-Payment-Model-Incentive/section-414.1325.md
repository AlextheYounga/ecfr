(1) A qualified registry for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(2) The EHR submission mechanism (which includes submission of data by health IT vendors or other authorized providers on behalf of MIPS eligible clinicians) for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(3) A QCDR for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(4) Medicare Part B claims for the quality performance category; or

(5) Attestation for the improvement activities and advancing care information performance categories.

(c) *Data submission mechanisms for groups that are not reporting through an APM.* Groups may submit their MIPS data using:

(1) A qualified registry for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(2) The EHR submission mechanism (which includes the submission of data by health IT vendors on behalf of groups) for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(3) A QCDR for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories;

(4) The CMS Web Interface (for groups consisting of 25 or more eligible clinicians) for the quality, improvement activities, and advancing care information performance categories.

(5) Attestation for the improvement activities and advancing care information performance categories; or

(6) A CMS-approved survey vendor for groups that elect to include the CAHPS for MIPS survey as a quality measure. Groups that elect to include the CAHPS for MIPS survey as a quality measure must select at least one other data submission mechanism described in this section to submit their other quality information.

(d) *Report measures and activities, as applicable, via multiple data submission mechanisms for the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance categories.* Beginning with the 2021 MIPS payment year, MIPS eligible clinicians, groups, and virtual groups may elect to submit measures and activities, as available, via multiple data submission mechanisms for a single performance category (specifically, the quality, improvement activities, or advancing care information performance category); provided, however, that the MIPS eligible clinician, group, or virtual group uses the same identifier for all performance categories and all submissions.

(e) *No data submission requirements for the cost performance category and certain quality measures.* There are no data submission requirements for the cost performance category and for certain quality measures used to assess performance in the quality performance category. CMS will calculate performance on these measures using administrative claims data.

(1) For the qualified registry, QCDR, EHR, and attestation submission mechanisms are March 31 following the close of the performance period.

(2) For Medicare Part B claims, data must be submitted on claims with dates of service during the performance period that must be processed no later than 60 days following the close of the performance period.

(3) For the CMS Web Interface, data must be submitted during an 8-week period following the close of the performance period. The period must begin no earlier than January 2 and end no later than March 31.
