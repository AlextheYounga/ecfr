##### ยง 414.1370 APM scoring standard under MIPS. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 53953, Nov. 16, 2017.

(a) *General.* The APM scoring standard is the MIPS scoring methodology applicable for MIPS eligible clinicians identified on the Participation List for the performance period of an APM Entity participating in a MIPS APM.

(b) *Criteria for MIPS APMs.* MIPS APMs are those in which:

(1) APM Entities participate in the APM under an agreement with CMS or through a law or regulation;

(2) The APM is designed such that APM Entities participating in the APM include at least one MIPS eligible clinician on a Participation List;

(3) The APM bases payment on cost/utilization and quality measures; and

(4) The APM is not either of the following:

(i) *New APMs.* An APM for which the first performance year begins after the first day of the MIPS performance period for the year.

(ii) *APM in final year of operation for which the APM scoring standard is impracticable.* An APM in the final year of operation for which CMS determines, within 60 days after the beginning of the MIPS performance period for the year, that it is impracticable for APM Entity groups to report to MIPS using the APM scoring standard.

(c) *APM scoring standard performance period.* The MIPS performance period under ยง 414.1320 applies for the APM scoring standard.

(d) *APM participant identifier.* The APM participant identifier for an eligible clinician is the combination of four identifiers:

(1) APM identifier (established for the APM by CMS);

(2) APM Entity identifier (established for the APM Entity by CMS);

(3) Medicare-enrolled billing TIN; and

(4) Eligible clinician NPI.

(e) *APM Entity group determination.* The APM Entity group is determined in the manner prescribed in ยง 414.1425(b)(1).

(f) *APM Entity group scoring under the APM scoring standard.* The MIPS final score calculated for the APM Entity group is applied to each MIPS eligible clinician in the APM Entity group. The MIPS payment adjustment is applied at the TIN/NPI level for each of the MIPS eligible clinicians in the APM Entity group. In the event that a Shared Savings Program ACO does not report quality measures as required by the Shared Savings Program, the ACO participant TINs will each be considered a unique APM Entity for purposes of the APM scoring standard.

(g) *MIPS performance category scoring under the APM scoring standard* - (1) *Quality* - (i) *MIPS APMs that require APM Entities to submit quality data using the CMS Web Interface.* The MIPS performance category score for quality for a performance period will be calculated for the APM Entity group using the data submitted for the APM Entity through the CMS Web Interface according to the terms of the APM. In the event that a Shared Savings Program ACO does not report on quality measures as required by the Shared Savings Program, the ACO participant TINs must report data for the MIPS quality performance category according to the MIPS submission and reporting requirements.

(ii) [Reserved]

(2) *Cost.* The cost performance category weight is zero percent for APM Entity groups in MIPS APMs.

(3) *Improvement activities.* (i) CMS assigns an improvement activities score for each MIPS APM for a performance period based on the requirements of the MIPS APM. The assigned improvement activities score applies to each APM Entity group in the MIPS APM for the performance year. In the event that the assigned score does not represent the maximum improvement activities score, APM Entities may report additional activities.

(ii) [Reserved]

(4) *Advancing care information.* (i) For APM Entity groups in the Shared Savings Program, each ACO participant TIN submits data on the advancing care information performance category as specified in ยง 414.1375(b) and performance on the advancing care information performance category is assessed for the APM Entity group by calculating the weighted mean of the TIN level scores, weighted based on the number of MIPS eligible clinicians in the TINs as compared to the total number of MIPS eligible clinicians in the APM Entity group.

(ii) For APM Entity groups in MIPS APMs other than the Shared Savings Program, CMS uses one score for each MIPS eligible clinician in the APM Entity group to derive a single average APM Entity group score for advancing care information. The score for each MIPS eligible clinician is the higher of either:

(A) A group score based on the measure data for the advancing care information performance category reported by a TIN for the MIPS eligible clinician according to the MIPS submission and reporting requirements for groups; or

(B) An individual score based on the measure data for the advancing care information performance category reported by the MIPS eligible clinician according to the MIPS submission and reporting requirements for individuals.

(h) *APM scoring standard performance category weights.* The performance category weights used to calculate the final score for an APM Entity group are:

(1) *Quality.* (i) For the Shared Savings Program and other MIPS APMs that require APM Entities to submit quality data through the CMS Web Interface: 50 percent.

(ii) For 2017, for MIPS APMs that do not require APM Entities to submit quality data through the CMS Web Interface: 0 percent.

(2) *Cost.* 0 percent.

(3) *Improvement activities.* (i) For the Shared Savings Program and other MIPS APMs that require APM Entities to submit quality data through the CMS Web Interface: 20 percent.

(ii) For 2017, for MIPS APMs that do not require APM Entities to submit quality data through the CMS Web Interface: 25 percent.

(4) *Advancing care information.* (i) For the Shared Savings Program and other MIPS APMs that require APM Entities to submit quality data through the CMS Web Interface: 30 percent.

(ii) For 2017, for MIPS APMs that do not require APM Entities to submit quality data through the CMS Web Interface: 75 percent.
