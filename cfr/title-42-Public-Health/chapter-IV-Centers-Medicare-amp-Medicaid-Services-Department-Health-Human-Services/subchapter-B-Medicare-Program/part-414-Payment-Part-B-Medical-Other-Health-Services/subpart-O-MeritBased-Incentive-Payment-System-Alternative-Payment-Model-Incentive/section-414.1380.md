##### § 414.1380 Scoring. #####

(a) *General.* MIPS eligible clinicians are scored under MIPS based on their performance on measures and activities in four performance categories. MIPS eligible clinicians are scored against performance standards for each performance category and receive a final score, composed of their scores on individual measures and activities, and calculated according to the final score methodology.

(1) *Measures and activities in the four performance categories are scored against performance standards.* (i) For the quality performance category, measures are scored between zero and 10 points. Performance is measured against benchmarks. Bonus points are available for both submitting specific types of measures and submitting measures using end-to-end electronic reporting. Starting with the 2020 MIPS payment year, improvement scoring is available in the quality performance category.

(ii) For the cost performance category, measures are scored between 1 and 10 points. Performance is measured against a benchmark. Starting with the 2020 MIPS payment year, improvement scoring is available in the cost performance category.

(iii) For the improvement activities performance category, each improvement activity is worth a certain number of points. The points for each reported activity are summed and scored against a total potential performance category score of 40 points.

(iv) For the advancing care information performance category, the performance category score is the sum of a base score, performance score, and bonus score.

(2) [Reserved]

(b) *Performance categories.* MIPS eligible clinicians are scored under MIPS in four performance categories.

(1) *Quality performance category.* For the 2019 and 2020 MIPS payment years, MIPS eligible clinicians receive between 3 and 10 measure achievement points for each submitted measure that can be reliably scored against a benchmark, which requires meeting the case minimum and data completeness requirements. A quality measure must have a measure benchmark to be scored based on performance. Quality measures that do not have a benchmark will not be scored based on performance. For the 2019 and 2020 MIPS payment years, MIPS eligible clinicians will receive 3 points for measures that are submitted but do not meet the required case minimum or do not have a benchmark. For the 2020 MIPS payment year, MIPS eligible clinicians will receive 1 point for measures that do not meet data completeness criteria, with an exception for measures submitted by small practices, which will receive 3 points, in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(vii) of this section.

(i) Measure benchmarks are based on historical performance for the measure based on a baseline period. Each benchmark must have a minimum of 20 individual clinicians or groups who reported the measure meeting the data completeness requirement and minimum case size criteria and performance greater than zero. Benchmark data are separated into decile categories based on a percentile distribution. We will restrict the benchmarks to data from MIPS eligible clinicians and comparable APM data, including data from QPs and Partial QPs.

(ii) As an exception, if there is no comparable data from the baseline period, CMS would use information from the performance period to create measure benchmarks, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, which would not be published until after the performance period. For the 2019 MIPS payment year, CMS would use information from CY 2017 during which MIPS eligible clinicians may report for a minimum of any continuous 90-day period.

(A) CMS Web Interface submission uses benchmarks from the corresponding reporting year of the Shared Savings Program.

(B) [Reserved]

(iii) Separate benchmarks are used for the following submission mechanisms:

(A) EHR submission options;

(B) QCDR and qualified registry submission options;

(C) Claims submission options;

(D) CMS Web Interface submission options;

(E) CMS-approved survey vendor for CAHPS for MIPS submission options; and

(F) Administrative claims submission options.

(iv) Minimum case requirements for quality measures are 20 cases, unless a measure is subject to an exception.

(v) As an exception, the minimum case requirements for the all-cause hospital readmission measure is 200 cases.

(vi) MIPS eligible clinicians failing to report a measure required under this category receive zero points for that measure.

(vii) Subject to paragraph (b)(1)(viii) of this section, MIPS eligible clinicians do not receive zero points if the expected measure is submitted but is unable to be scored because it does not meet the required case minimum or if the measure does not have a measure benchmark for MIPS payment years 2019 and 2020. Instead, these measures receive a score of 3 points in MIPS payment years 2019 and 2020. MIPS eligible clinicians do not receive zero points if the expected measure is submitted but is unable to be scored because it is below the data completeness requirement. Instead, these measures receive a score of 3 points in the 2019 MIPS payment year and a score of 1 point in the 2020 MIPS payment year, except if the measure is submitted by a small practice. Measures below the data completeness requirement submitted by a small practice receive a score of 3 points in the 2020 MIPS payment year.

(viii) As an exception, the administrative claims-based measures and CMS Web Interface measures will not be scored if these measures do not meet the required case minimum. For CMS Web Interface measures, we will recognize the measure was submitted but exclude the measure from being scored. For CMS Web Interface measures: Measures that do not have a measure benchmark and measures that have a measure benchmark but are redesignated as pay for reporting for all Shared Savings Program accountable care organizations by the Shared Savings Program, CMS will recognize the measure was submitted but exclude the measure from being scored as long as the data completeness requirement is met. CMS Web Interface measures that are below the data completeness requirement will be scored and receive 0 points.

(ix) Measures submitted by MIPS eligible clinicians are scored against measure benchmarks using a percentile distribution, separated by decile categories.

(x) For each set of benchmarks, CMS calculates the decile breaks for measure performance and assigns points based on which benchmark decile range the MIPS eligible clinician's measure rate is between.

(xi) CMS assigns partial points based on the percentile distribution.

(xii) MIPS eligible clinicians are required to submit measures consistent with § 414.1335.

(A) MIPS eligible clinicians that submit measures via claims, qualified registry, EHR, or QCDR submission mechanisms, and submit more than the required number of measures are scored on the required measures with the highest measure achievement points. Beginning in the 2021 MIPS payment year, MIPS eligible clinicians that report a measure via more than one submission mechanism can be scored on only one submission mechanism for that measure, which will be the submission mechanism with the highest measure achievement points. Groups that submit via these submission options may also submit and be scored on CMS-approved survey vendor for CAHPS for MIPS submission mechanisms.

(B) Groups that submit measures via the CMS Web Interface may also submit and be scored on CMS-approved survey vendor for CAHPS for MIPS submission mechanisms.

(xiii) CMS will identify topped out measures in the benchmarks published for each Quality Payment Program year.

(A) For the 2020 MIPS payment year, selected topped out measures identified by CMS will receive no more than 7 measure achievement points, provided that the measure benchmarks for the applicable submission mechanisms are identified as topped out in the benchmarks published for the 2018 MIPS performance period.

(B) Beginning with the 2021 MIPS payment year, a measure, except for measures in the CMS Web Interface, whose benchmark is identified as topped out for 2 or more consecutive years will receive no more than 7 measure achievement points in the second consecutive year it is identified as topped out, and beyond.

(xiv) Measure bonus points are available for measures determined to be high priority measures when two or more high priority measures are reported.

(A) Measure bonus points are not available for the first reported high priority measure which is required to be reported. To qualify for measure bonus points, each measure must be reported with sufficient case volume to meet the required case minimum, meet the required data completeness criteria, and not have a zero percent performance rate. Measure bonus points may be included in the calculation of the quality performance category percent score regardless of whether the measure is included in the calculation of the total measure achievement points.

(B) Outcome and patient experience measures receive two measure bonus points.

(C) Other high priority measures receive one measure bonus point.

(D) Measure bonus points for high priority measures cannot exceed 10 percent of the total available measure achievement points for the 2019 and 2020 MIPS payment years.

(E) If the same high priority measure is submitted via two or more submission mechanisms, the measure will receive high priority measure bonus points only once for the measure beginning in the 2021 MIPS payment year.

(xv) One measure bonus point is also available for each measure submitted with end-to-end electronic reporting for a quality measure under certain criteria determined by the Secretary. Bonus points cannot exceed 10 percent of the total available measure achievement points for the 2019 and 2020 MIPS payment years. If the same measure is submitted via 2 or more submission mechanisms, the measure will receive measure bonus points only once for the measure beginning in the 2021 MIPS payment year.

(xvi) Improvement scoring is available to MIPS eligible clinicians that demonstrate improvement in performance in the current MIPS performance period compared to performance in the performance period immediately prior to the current MIPS performance period based on measure achievement points.

(A) Improvement scoring is available when the data sufficiency standard is met, which means when data are available and a MIPS eligible clinician has a quality performance category achievement percent score for the previous performance period and the current performance period.

(*1*) Data must be comparable to meet the requirement of data sufficiency which means that the quality performance category achievement percent score is available for the current performance period and the previous performance period and quality performance category achievement percent scores can be compared.

(*2*) Quality performance category achievement percent scores are comparable when submissions are received from the same identifier for two consecutive performance periods.

(*3*) If the identifier is not the same for 2 consecutive performance periods, then for individual submissions, the comparable quality performance category achievement percent score is the highest available quality performance category achievement percent score associated with the final score from the prior performance period that will be used for payment for the individual. For group, virtual group, and APM Entity submissions, the comparable quality performance category achievement percent score is the average of the quality performance category achievement percent score associated with the final score from the prior performance period that will be used for payment for each of the individuals in the group.

(B) The improvement percent score may not total more than 10 percentage points.

(C) The improvement percent score is assessed at the performance category level for the quality performance category and included in the calculation of the quality performance category percent score as described in paragraph (b)(1)(xvii) of this section.

(*1*) The improvement percent score is awarded based on the rate of increase in the quality performance category achievement percent score of MIPS eligible clinicians from the previous performance period to the current performance period.

(*2*) An improvement percent score is calculated by dividing the increase in the quality performance category achievement percent score from the prior performance period to the current performance period by the prior performance period quality performance category achievement percent score multiplied by 10 percent.

(*3*) An improvement percent score cannot be lower than zero percentage points.

(*4*) For the 2020 MIPS payment year, if a MIPS eligible clinician has a previous year quality performance category achievement percent score less than or equal to 30 percent, then the 2018 performance will be compared to an assumed 2017 quality performance category achievement percent score of 30 percent.

(*5*) The improvement percent score is zero if the MIPS eligible clinician did not fully participate in the quality performance category for the current performance period.

(D) For the purpose of improvement scoring methodology, the term “quality performance category achievement percent score” means the total measure achievement points divided by the total available measure achievement points, without consideration of measure bonus points or improvement percent score.

(E) For the purpose of improvement scoring methodology, the term “improvement percent score” means the score that represents improvement for the purposes of calculating the quality performance category percent score as described in paragraph (b)(1)(xvii) of this section.

(F) For the purpose of improvement scoring methodology, the term “fully participate” means the MIPS eligible clinician met all requirements in §§ 414.1330 and 414.1340.

(xvii) A MIPS eligible clinician's quality performance category percent score is the sum of all the measure achievement points assigned for the measures required for the quality performance category criteria plus the measure bonus points in paragraph (b)(1)(xiv) of this section and measure bonus points in paragraph (b)(1)(xv) of this section. The sum is divided by the sum of total available measure achievement points. The improvement percent score in paragraph (b)(1)(xvi) of this section is added to that result. The quality performance category percent score cannot exceed 100 percentage points.

(xviii) Beginning with the 2018 MIPS performance period, measures significantly impacted by ICD-10 updates, as determined by CMS, will be assessed based only on the first 9 months of the 12-month performance period. For purposes of this paragraph, CMS will make a determination as to whether a measure is significantly impacted by ICD-10 coding changes during the performance period. CMS will publish on the CMS Web site which measures require a 9-month assessment process by October 1st of the performance period if technically feasible, but by no later than the beginning of the data submission period at § 414.1325(f)(1).

(2) *Cost performance category.* A MIPS eligible clinician receives one to ten achievement points for each cost measure attributed to the MIPS eligible clinician based on the MIPS eligible clinician's performance compared to the measure benchmark.

(i) Cost measure benchmarks are based on the performance period. Cost measures must have a benchmark to be scored.

(ii) A MIPS eligible clinician must meet the minimum case volume specified by CMS to be scored on a cost measure.

(iii) A MIPS eligible clinician cost performance category percent score is the sum of the following, not to exceed 100 percent:

(A) The total number of achievement points earned by the MIPS eligible clinician divided by the total number of available achievement points; and

(B) The cost improvement score, as determined under paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.

(iv) Cost improvement scoring is available to MIPS eligible clinicians that demonstrate improvement in performance in the current MIPS performance period compared to their performance in the immediately preceding MIPS performance period.

(A) The cost improvement score is determined at the measure level for the cost performance category.

(B) The cost improvement score is calculated only when data sufficient to measure improvement is available. Sufficient data is available when a MIPS eligible clinician or group participates in MIPS using the same identifier in 2 consecutive performance periods and is scored on the same cost measure(s) for 2 consecutive performance periods. If the cost improvement score cannot be calculated because sufficient data is not available, then the cost improvement score is zero.

(C) The cost improvement score is determined by comparing the number of measures with a statistically significant change (improvement or decline) in performance; a change is determined to be significant based on application of a t-test. The number of cost measures with a significant decline is subtracted from the number of cost measures with a significant improvement, with the result divided by the number of cost measures for which the MIPS eligible clinician or group was scored for two consecutive performance periods. The resulting fraction is then multiplied by the maximum improvement score.

(D) The cost improvement score cannot be lower than zero percentage points.

(E) The maximum cost improvement score for the 2020 MIPS payment year is 1 percentage point.

(v) A cost performance category percent score is not calculated if a MIPS eligible clinician is not attributed any cost measures because the clinician or group has not met the case minimum requirements for any of the cost measures or a benchmark has not been created for any of the cost measures that would otherwise be attributed to the clinician or group.

(3) *Improvement activities performance category.* MIPS eligible clinicians and groups receive points for improvement activities based on patient-centered medical home or comparable specialty practice participation, APM participation, and improvement activities reported by the MIPS eligible clinician in comparison to the highest potential score (40 points) for a given MIPS year. For purposes of this paragraph, “full credit” means that the MIPS eligible clinician or group has met the highest potential score for the improvement activities performance category.

(i) CMS assigns credit for the total possible category score for each reported improvement activity based on two weights: Medium-weighted and high-weighted activities.

(ii) Improvement activities with a high weighting receive credit for 20 points, toward the total possible category score.

(iii) Improvement activities with a medium weighting receive credit for 10 points toward the total possible category score.

(iv) A MIPS eligible clinician or group in a practice that is certified or recognized as a patient-centered medical home or comparable specialty practice, as determined by the Secretary, receives full credit for performance on the improvement activities performance category. A practice is certified or recognized as a patient-centered medical home if it meets any of the following criteria:

(A) The practice has received accreditation from one of four accreditation organizations that are nationally recognized;

(*1*) The Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care;

(*2*) The National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA);

(*3*) The Joint Commission; or

(*4*) The Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (URAC).

(B) The practice is participating in a Medicaid Medical Home Model or Medical Home Model.

(C) The practice is a comparable specialty practice that has received the NCQA Patient-Centered Specialty Recognition.

(D) The practice has received accreditation from other certifying bodies that have certified a large number of medical organizations and meet national guidelines, as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary must determine that these certifying bodies must have 500 or more certified member practices, and require practices to include the following:

(*1*) Have a personal physician/clinician in a team-based practice.

(*2*) Have a whole-person orientation.

(*3*) Provide coordination or integrated care.

(*4*) Focus on quality and safety.

(*5*) Provide enhanced access.

(v) CMS compares the points associated with the reported activities against the highest potential category score of 40 points.

(vi) A MIPS eligible clinician or group's improvement activities category score is the sum of points for all of their reported activities, which is capped at 40 points, divided by the highest potential category score of 40 points.

(vii) Non-patient facing MIPS eligible clinicians and groups, small practices, and practices located in rural areas and geographic HPSAs receive full credit for improvement activities by selecting one high-weighted improvement activity or two medium-weighted improvement activities. Non-patient facing MIPS eligible clinicians and groups, small practices, and practices located in rural areas and geographic HPSAs receive half credit for improvement activities by selecting one medium-weighted improvement activity.

(viii) For the transition year, to receive full credit as a certified or recognized patient-centered medical home or comparable specialty a TIN that is reporting must include at least one practice site which is a certified patient-centered medical home or comparable specialty practice.

(ix) MIPS eligible clinicians participating in APMs that are not patient-centered medical homes for a performance period shall earn a minimum score of one-half of the highest potential score for the improvement activities performance category.

(x) For the 2020 MIPS payment year and future years, to receive full credit as a certified or recognized patient-centered medical home or comparable specialty practice, at least 50 percent of the practice sites within the TIN must be recognized as a patient-centered medical home or comparable specialty practice.

(4) *Advancing care information performance category.* (i) A MIPS eligible clinician's advancing care information performance category score equals the sum of the base score, performance score, and any applicable bonus scores. A MIPS eligible clinician cannot earn the performance score or base score until they have fulfilled the base score. The advancing care information performance category score will not exceed 100 percentage points.

(A) A MIPS eligible clinician earns a base score by reporting the numerator (of at least one) and denominator or a yes/no statement or an exclusion; as applicable, for each required measure.

(B) A MIPS eligible clinician earns a performance score by reporting on certain measures specified by CMS. MIPS eligible clinicians may earn up to 10 or 20 percentage points as specified by CMS for each measure reported for the performance score.

(C) A MIPS eligible clinician may earn the following bonus scores:

(*1*) A bonus score of 5 percentage points for reporting to one or more additional public health agencies or clinical data registries.

(*2*) A bonus score of 10 percentage points for attesting to completing one or more improvement activities specified by CMS using CEHRT.

(*3*) For the 2020 MIPS payment year, a bonus score of 10 percentage points for submitting data for the measures for the base score and the performance score generated solely from 2015 Edition CEHRT.

(c) *Final score calculation.* Each MIPS eligible clinician receives a final score of 0 to 100 points for a performance period for a MIPS payment year calculated as follows:

Final score = [(quality performance category percent score × quality performance category weight) + (cost performance category percent score × cost performance category weight) + (improvement activities performance category score × improvement activities performance category weight) + (advancing care information performance category score × advancing care information performance category weight)] × 100 + [the complex patient bonus + the small practice bonus], not to exceed 100 points.

If a MIPS eligible clinician is scored on fewer than 2 performance categories, he or she receives a final score equal to the performance threshold.

(1) *Performance category weights.* The weights of the performance categories in the final score are as follows, unless a different scoring weight is assigned under paragraph (c)(2) of this section:

(i) Quality performance category weight is defined under § 414.1330(b).

(ii) Cost performance category weight is defined under § 414.1350(b).

(iii) Improvement activities performance category weight is defined under § 414.1355(b).

(iv) Advancing care information performance category weight is defined under § 414.1375(a).

(2) *Reweighting the performance categories.* A scoring weight different from the weights specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be assigned to a performance category, and its weight as specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be redistributed to another performance category or categories, in the following circumstances:

(i) CMS determines there are not sufficient measures and activities applicable and available to MIPS eligible clinicians pursuant to section 1848(q)(5)(F) of the Act.

(ii) CMS estimates that the proportion of eligible professionals who are meaningful EHR users is 75 percent or greater pursuant to section 1848(q)(5)(E)(ii) of the Act.

(iii) A significant hardship exception or other type of exception is granted to a MIPS eligible clinician for the advancing care information performance category pursuant to section 1848(o)(2)(D) of the Act.

(3) *Complex patient bonus.* Provided that the MIPS eligible clinician, group, virtual group or APM entity submits data for at least one MIPS performance category during the 2018 MIPS performance period, a complex patient bonus will be added to the final score for the 2020 MIPS payment year, as follows:

(i) For MIPS eligible clinicians and groups, the complex patient bonus is calculated as follows: [The average HCC risk score assigned to beneficiaries (pursuant to the HCC risk adjustment model established by CMS pursuant to section 1853(a)(1) of the Act) seen by the MIPS eligible clinician or seen by clinicians in a group] + [the dual eligible ratio × 5].

(ii) For APM entities and virtual groups, the complex patient bonus is calculated as follows: [The beneficiary weighted average HCC risk score for all MIPS eligible clinicians, and if technically feasible, TINs for models and virtual groups which rely on complete TIN participation within the APM entity or virtual group, respectively] + [the average dual eligible ratio for all MIPS eligible clinicians, and if technically feasible, TINs for models and virtual groups which rely on complete TIN participation, within the APM entity or virtual group, respectively, × 5].

(iii) The complex patient bonus cannot exceed 5.0.

(4) *Small practice bonus.* A small practice bonus of 5 points will be added to the final score for the 2020 MIPS payment year for MIPS eligible clinicians, groups, virtual groups, and APM Entities that meet the definition of a small practice as defined at § 414.1305 and participate in MIPS by submitting data on at least one performance category in the 2018 MIPS performance period.

(d) *Scoring for APM Entities.* MIPS eligible clinicians in APM Entities that are subject to the APM scoring standard are scored using the methodology under § 414.1370.

(e) *Scoring for facility-based measurement.* For the payment in 2021 MIPS payment year and subsequent years, a MIPS eligible clinician or group may elect to be scored under the quality and cost performance categories using facility-based measures under the methodology described in this paragraph.

(1) *General.* The facility-based measurement scoring standard is the MIPS scoring methodology applicable for MIPS eligible clinicians identified as meeting the requirements in paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section.

(2) *Eligibility for facility-based measurement.* MIPS eligible clinicians are eligible for facility-based measurement for a MIPS payment year if they are determined to be facility-based as an individual clinician or as part of a group, as follows:

(i) *Facility-based individual determination.* A MIPS eligible clinician furnishes 75 percent or more of his or her covered professional services in sites of service identified by the place of service codes used in the HIPAA standard transaction as an inpatient hospital or emergency room setting based on claims for a period prior to the performance period as specified by CMS.

(ii) *Facility-based group determination.* A facility-based group is a group in which 75 percent or more of its eligible clinician NPIs billing under the group's TIN meet the requirements under paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section.

(3) [Reserved].

(4) *Data submission for facility-based measurement.* There are no data submission requirements for clinicians that elect facility-based measurement.

(5) *Determination of applicable facility score.* A facility-based clinician or group receives a score under the facility-based measurement scoring standard derived from the value-based purchasing score for the facility at which the clinician or group provided services to the most Medicare beneficiaries during the year the claims are drawn from in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. If there is an equal number of Medicare beneficiaries treated at more than one facility, the value-based purchasing score for the highest scoring facility is used.

(6) *MIPS performance category scoring under the facility-based measurement scoring standard* - (i) *Measures.* The quality and cost measures are those adopted under the value-based purchasing program of the facility for the year specified.

(ii) *Benchmarks.* The benchmarks are those adopted under the value-based purchasing program of the facility program for the year specified.

(iii) *Performance period.* The performance period for facility-based measurement is the performance period for the measures adopted under the value-based purchasing program of the facility program for the year specified.

(iv) *Quality.* The quality performance category percent score is established by determining the percentile performance of the facility in the value-based purchasing program for the specified year as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section and awarding a score associated with that same percentile performance in the MIPS quality performance category percent score for those MIPS-eligible clinicians who are not scored using facility-based measurement for the MIPS payment year.

(v) *Cost.* The cost performance category percent score is established by determining the percentile performance of the facility in the value-based purchasing program for the specified year as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section and awarding a score associated with that same percentile performance in the MIPS cost performance category percent score [for those MIPS eligible clinicians who are not scored using facility-based measurement] for the MIPS payment year.

(A) *Other cost measures.* MIPS eligible clinicians who elect facility-based measurement are not scored on cost measures described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(B) [Reserved]
