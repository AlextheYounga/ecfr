##### § 414.1385 Targeted review and review limitations. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 63197, Nov. 15, 2019.

(a) *Targeted review.* MIPS eligible clinicians or groups may request a targeted review of the calculation of the MIPS payment adjustment factor under section 1848(q)(6)(A) of the Act and, as applicable, the calculation of the additional MIPS payment adjustment factor under section 1848(q)(6)(C) of the Act applicable to such MIPS eligible clinician or group for a year. The process for targeted reviews is:

(1) MIPS eligible clinicians and groups have a 60-day period to submit a request for targeted review, which begins on the day CMS makes available the MIPS payment adjustment factor, and if applicable the additional MIPS payment adjustment factor, for the MIPS payment year and ends on September 30 of the year prior to the MIPS payment year or a later date specified by CMS.

(2) CMS will respond to each request for targeted review timely submitted and determine whether a targeted review is warranted.

(3) The MIPS eligible clinician or group may include additional information in support of their request for targeted review at the time the request is submitted. If CMS requests additional information from the MIPS eligible clinician or group, it must be provided and received by CMS within 30 days of the request. Non-responsiveness to the request for additional information may result in the closure of the targeted review request, although the MIPS eligible clinician or group may submit another request for targeted review before the deadline.

(4) Decisions based on the targeted review are final, and there is no further review or appeal.

(b) *Limitations on review.* Except as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, there is no administrative or judicial review under section 1869 or 1879 of the Act, or otherwise of -

(1) The methodology used to determine the amount of the MIPS payment adjustment factor and the amount of the additional MIPS payment adjustment factor and the determination of such amounts;

(2) The establishment of the performance standards and the performance period;

(3) The identification of measures and activities specified for a MIPS performance category and information made public or posted on the Physician Compare Internet Web site of the CMS; and

(4) The methodology developed that is used to calculate performance scores and the calculation of such scores, including the weighting of measures and activities under such methodology.
