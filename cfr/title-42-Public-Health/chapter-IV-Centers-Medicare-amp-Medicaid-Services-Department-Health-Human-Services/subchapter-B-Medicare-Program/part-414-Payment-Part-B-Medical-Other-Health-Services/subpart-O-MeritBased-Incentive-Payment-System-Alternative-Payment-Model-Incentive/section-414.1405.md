(a) *General.* Each MIPS eligible clinician receives a MIPS payment adjustment factor, and if applicable an additional MIPS payment adjustment factor for exceptional performance, for a MIPS payment year determined by comparing their final score to the performance threshold and additional performance threshold for the year.

(b) *Performance threshold.* A performance threshold will be specified for each MIPS payment year.

(1) MIPS eligible clinicians with a final score at or above the performance threshold receive a zero or positive MIPS payment adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale such that an adjustment factor of 0 percent is assigned for a final score at the performance threshold and an adjustment factor of the applicable percent is assigned for a final score of 100.

(2) MIPS eligible clinicians with a final score below the performance threshold receive a negative MIPS payment adjustment factor on a linear sliding scale such that an adjustment factor of 0 percent is assigned for a final score at the performance threshold and an adjustment factor of the negative of the applicable percent is assigned for a final score of 0; further, MIPS eligible clinicians with final scores that are equal to or greater than zero, but not greater than one-fourth of the performance threshold, receive a negative MIPS payment adjustment factor that is equal to the negative of the applicable percent.

(3) A scaling factor not to exceed 3.0 may be applied to positive MIPS payment adjustment factors to ensure budget neutrality such that the estimated increase in aggregate allowed charges resulting from the application of the positive MIPS payment adjustment factors for the MIPS payment year equals the estimated decrease in aggregate allowed charges resulting from the application of negative MIPS payment adjustment factors for the MIPS payment year.

(4) The performance threshold for the 2019 MIPS payment year is 3 points.

(5) The performance threshold for the 2020 MIPS payment year is 15 points.

(c) *Applicable percent.* For MIPS payment year 2019, 4 percent. For MIPS payment year 2020, 5 percent. For MIPS payment year 2021, 7 percent. For MIPS payment year 2022 and each subsequent MIPS payment year, 9 percent.

(d) *Additional performance threshold.* An additional performance threshold will be specified for each of the MIPS payment years 2019 through 2024.

(1) In addition to the MIPS payment adjustment factor, MIPS eligible clinicians with a final score at or above the additional performance threshold receive an additional MIPS payment adjustment factor for exceptional performance on a linear sliding scale such that an additional adjustment factor of 0.5 percent is assigned for a final score at the additional performance threshold and an additional adjustment factor of 10 percent is assigned for a final score of 100, subject to the application of a scaling factor as determined by CMS, such that the estimated aggregate increase in payments resulting from the application of the additional MIPS payment adjustment factors for the MIPS payment year shall not exceed $500,000,000 for each of the MIPS payment years 2019 through 2024.

(2) [Reserved]

(3) The additional performance threshold for the 2019 MIPS payment year is 70 points.

(4) The additional performance threshold for the 2020 MIPS payment year is 70 points.

(e) *Application of adjustments to payments.* For each MIPS payment year, the MIPS payment adjustment factor, and if applicable the additional MIPS payment adjustment factor, are applied to Medicare Part B payments for items and services furnished by the MIPS eligible clinician during the year.
