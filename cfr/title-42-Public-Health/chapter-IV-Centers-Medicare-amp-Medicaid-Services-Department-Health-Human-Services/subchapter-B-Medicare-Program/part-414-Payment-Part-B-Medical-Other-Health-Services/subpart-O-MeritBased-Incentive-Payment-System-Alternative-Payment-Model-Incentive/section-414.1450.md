(a) *In general.* (1) CMS makes a lump sum payment to QPs in the amount described in paragraph (b) of this section in the manner described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.

(2) CMS provides notice of the amount of the APM Incentive Payment to QPs as soon as practicable following the calculation and validation of the APM Incentive Payment amount, but in any event no later than 1 year after the incentive payment base period.

(b) *APM Incentive Payment amount.* (1) The amount of the APM Incentive Payment is equal to 5 percent of the estimated aggregate payments for covered professional services as defined in section 1848(k)(3)(A) of the Act furnished during the calendar year immediately preceding the payment year.

(2) The estimated aggregate payment amount for covered professional services includes all such payments to any and all of the TIN/NPI combinations associated with the NPI of the QP.

(3) In calculating the estimated aggregate payment amount for a QP, CMS uses claims submitted with dates of service from January 1 through December 31 of the incentive payment base period, and processing dates of January 1 of the base period through March 31 of the subsequent payment year.

(4) The payment adjustment amounts, negative or positive, as described in sections 1848(m), (o), (p), and (q) of the Act are not included in calculating the APM Incentive Payment amount.

(5) Incentive payments made to eligible clinicians under sections 1833(m), (x), and (y) of the Act are not included in calculating the APM Incentive Payment amount.

(6) Financial risk payments such as shared savings payments or net reconciliation payments are excluded from the amount of covered professional services in calculating the APM Incentive Payment amount.

(7) Supplemental service payments in the amount of covered professional services are included in calculating the APM Incentive Payment amount according to this paragraph (b). Supplemental service payments are included in the amount of covered professional services when calculating the APM Incentive Payment amount when the supplemental service payment meets the following four criteria:

(i) Is payment for services that constitute physicians services authorized under section 1832(a) and defined under section 1861(s) of the Act.

(ii) Is made for only Part B services under the criterion in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section.

(iii) Is directly attributable to services furnished to an individual beneficiary.

(iv) Is directly attributable to an eligible clinician, including an eligible clinician that is a group of individual eligible clinicians.

(8) For payment amounts that are affected by a cash flow mechanism, the payment amounts that would have occurred if the cash flow mechanism were not in place are used in calculating the APM Incentive Payment amount.

(c) *APM Incentive Payment recipient.* (1) CMS pays the entire APM Incentive Payment amount to the TIN associated with the QP's participation in the Advanced APM entity that met the applicable QP threshold during the QP Performance Period.

(2) In the event that an eligible clinician is no longer affiliated with the TIN associated with the QP's participation in the Advanced APM Entity that met the applicable QP threshold during the QP Performance Period at the time of the APM Incentive Payment distribution, CMS makes the APM Incentive Payment to the TIN listed on the eligible clinician's CMS-588 EFT Application form on the date that the APM Incentive Payment is distributed.

(3) In the event that an eligible clinician becomes a QP through participation in multiple Advanced APMs, CMS divides the APM Incentive Payment amount between the TINs associated with the QP's participation in each Advanced APM during the QP Performance Period. Such payments will be divided in proportion to the amount of payments associated with each TIN that the eligible clinician received for covered professional services during the QP Performance Period.

(d) *Timing of the APM Incentive Payment.* APM Incentive Payments made under this section are made as soon as practicable following the calculation and validation of the APM Incentive Payment amount, but in any event no later than 1 year after the incentive payment base period.

(e) *Treatment of APM Incentive Payment amount in APMs.* (1) APM Incentive Payments made under this section are not included in determining actual expenditures under an APM.

(2) APM Incentive Payments made under this section are not included in calculations for the purposes of rebasing benchmarks in an APM.

(f) *Treatment of APM Incentive Payment for other Medicare incentive payments and payment adjustments.* APM Incentive Payments made under this section will not be included in determining the amount of incentive payment made to eligible clinicians under section 1833(m), (x), and (y) of the Act.
