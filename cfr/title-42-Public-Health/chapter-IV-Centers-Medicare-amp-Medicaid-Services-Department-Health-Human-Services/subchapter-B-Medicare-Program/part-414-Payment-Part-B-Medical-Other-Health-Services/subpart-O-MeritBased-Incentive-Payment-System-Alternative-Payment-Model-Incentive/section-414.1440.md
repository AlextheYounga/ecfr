##### ยง 414.1440 Qualifying APM participant determination: All-payer combination option. #####

(a) *Payments excluded from calculations.* (1) These calculations include a combination of both Medicare payments for Part B covered professional services and all other payments for all other payers, except for payments made by:

(i) The Secretary of Defense for the costs of Department of Defense health care programs;

(ii) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the cost of Department of Veterans Affairs health care programs; and

(iii) Under Title XIX in a State in which no Medicaid Medical Home Model or APM is available.

(2) Title XIX payments will only be included in the numerator and denominator as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section for an Advanced APM Entity if:

(i) A State has at least one Medicaid Medical Home Model or Medicaid APM in operation that is determined to be an Other Payer Advanced APM; and

(ii) The Advanced APM Entity is eligible to participate in at least one of such Other Payer Advanced APMs during the QP Performance Period, regardless of whether the Advanced APM Entity actually participates in such Other Payer Advanced APMs. This will apply to both the payment amount and patient count methods.

(b) *Payment amount method* - (1) *In general.* The Threshold Score for an Advanced APM Entity group or eligible clinician will be calculated by dividing the value described under the numerator by the value described under the denominator as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section.

(2) *Numerator.* The aggregate amount of all payments from all payers, except those excluded under paragraph (a) of this section, to the Advanced APM Entity group or eligible clinician under the terms of Other Payer Advanced APMs during the QP Performance Period. CMS calculates Medicare Part B covered professional services under the All-Payer Combination Option in the same manner as it is calculated under the Medicare Option.

(3) *Denominator.* The aggregate amount of all payments from all payers, except those excluded under paragraph (a) of this section, to the Advanced APM Entity group during the QP Performance Period. The portion of this amount that relates to Medicare Part B covered professional services is calculated under the All-Payer Combination Option in the same manner as it is calculated under the Medicare Option.

(c) *Patient count method* - (1) *In general.* The Threshold Score for an Advanced APM Entity group or eligible clinician is calculated by dividing the value described under the numerator by the value described under the denominator as specified in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this section).

(2) *Numerator.* The number of unique patients to whom the Advanced APM Entity group or eligible clinician furnishes services that are included in the measures of aggregate expenditures used under the terms of all of their Other Payer Advanced APMs during the QP Performance Period, plus the patient count numerator specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(3) *Denominator.* The number of unique patients to whom eligible clinicians in the Advanced APM Entity group furnish services under all non-excluded payers during the QP Performance Period.

(d) *Participation in multiple Other Payer Advanced APMs.* (1) For each APM Entity group or eligible clinician, a unique patient is counted no more than one time for the numerator and no more than one time for the denominator for each payer.

(2) CMS may count a single patient in the numerator and/or denominator for multiple different Advanced APM Entities or eligible clinicians.

(3) For purposes of this section, Advanced APM Entities are considered the same entity across Other Payer Advanced APMs if CMS determines that the Participation Lists are substantially similar or if one entity is a subset of the other.
