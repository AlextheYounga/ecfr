*Qualified clinical data registry (QCDR)* means:

(1) For the 2019, 2020 and 2021 MIPS payment year, a CMS-approved entity that has self-nominated and successfully completed a qualification process to determine whether the entity may collect medical or clinical data for the purpose of patient and disease tracking to foster improvement in the quality of care provided to patients.

(2) Beginning with the 2022 MIPS payment year, an entity that demonstrates clinical expertise in medicine and quality measurement development experience and collects medical or clinical data on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician for the purpose of patient and disease tracking to foster improvement in the quality of care provided to patients.

*Qualified registry* means a medical registry, a maintenance of certification program operated by a specialty body of the American Board of Medical Specialties or other data intermediary that, with respect to a particular performance period, has self-nominated and successfully completed a vetting process (as specified by CMS) to demonstrate its compliance with the MIPS qualification requirements specified by CMS for that performance period. The registry must have the requisite legal authority to submit MIPS data (as specified by CMS) on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician or group to CMS.

*Qualifying APM participant (QP)* means an eligible clinician determined by CMS to have met or exceeded the relevant QP payment amount or QP patient count threshold under ยง 414.1430(a)(1), (a)(3), (b)(1), or (b)(3) for a year based on participation in an APM Entity that is also participating in an Advanced APM.

*Rural area* means a ZIP code designated as rural by the Federal Office of Rural Health Policy (FORHP), using the most recent FORHP Eligible ZIP Code file available.

*Small practice* means:

(1) For the 2019 MIPS payment year, a TIN consisting of 15 or fewer eligible clinicians.

(2) For the 2020 MIPS payment year, a TIN consisting of 15 or fewer eligible clinicians during a 12-month assessment period that spans from the last 4 months of the calendar year 2 years prior to the performance period through the first 8 months of the calendar year preceding the performance period and includes a 30-day claims run out.

(3) Beginning with the 2021 MIPS payment year, a TIN consisting of 15 or fewer eligible clinicians during the MIPS determination period.

*Solo practitioner* means a practice consisting of 1 eligible clinician (who is also a MIPS eligible clinician).

*Submission type* means the mechanism by which the submitter type submits data to CMS, including, but not limited to: Direct, log in and upload, log in and attest, Medicare Part B claims and the CMS Web Interface.

*Submitter type* means the MIPS eligible clinician, group, virtual group, or third party intermediary acting on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician, group, or virtual group, as applicable, that submits data on measures and activities under MIPS.

*Third party intermediary* means an entity that has been approved under ยง 414.1400 to submit data on behalf of a MIPS eligible clinician, group, or virtual group for one or more of the quality, improvement activities, and promoting interoperability performance categories.

*Threshold Score* means the percentage value that CMS determines for an eligible clinician based on the calculations described in ยง 414.1435 or ยง 414.1440.

*Topped out non-process measure* means a measure where the Truncated Coefficient of Variation is less than 0.10 and the 75th and 90th percentiles are within 2 standard errors.

*Topped out process measure* means a measure with a median performance rate of 95 percent or higher.

*Virtual group* means a combination of two or more TINs assigned to one or more solo practitioners or to one or more groups consisting of 10 or fewer eligible clinicians, or both, that elect to form a virtual group for a performance period for a year.
