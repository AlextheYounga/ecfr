##### ยง 414.1395 Public reporting. #####

(a) *Public reporting of eligible clinician and group Quality Payment Program information.* For each program year, CMS posts on Physician Compare, in an easily understandable format, information regarding the performance of eligible clinicians or groups under the Quality Payment Program.

(b) *Maintain existing public reporting standards.* With the exception of data that must be mandatorily reported on Physician Compare, for each program year, CMS relies on established public reporting standards to guide the information available for inclusion on Physician Compare. The public reporting standards require data included on Physician Compare to be statistically valid, reliable, and accurate; comparable across collection types; and meet the reliability threshold. And, to be included on the public facing profile pages, the data must also resonate with website users, as determined by CMS.

(c) *First year measures.* For each program year, CMS does not publicly report any first year measure for the first 2 years, meaning any measure in its first 2 years of use in the quality and cost performance categories. After the first 2 years, CMS reevaluates measures to determine when and if they are suitable for public reporting.

(d) *30-day preview period.* For each program year, CMS provides a 30-day preview period for any clinician or group with Quality Payment Program data before the data are publicly reported on Physician Compare.
