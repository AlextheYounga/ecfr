##### § 414.1395 Public reporting. #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 65677, Nov. 19, 2021.

(a) *General.* (1) CMS posts on Physician Compare, in an easily understandable format, the following:

(i) Information regarding the performance of MIPS eligible clinicians, including, but not limited to, final scores and performance category scores for each MIPS eligible clinician; and

(ii) The names of eligible clinicians in Advanced APMs and, to the extent feasible, the names and performance of such Advanced APMs.

(2) CMS periodically posts on Physician Compare aggregate information on the MIPS, including the range of final scores for all MIPS eligible clinicians and the range of the performance of all MIPS eligible clinicians with respect to each performance category.

(3) The information made available under this section will indicate, where appropriate, that publicized information may not be representative of an eligible clinician's entire patient population, the variety of services furnished by the eligible clinician, or the health conditions of individuals treated.

(b) *Maintain existing public reporting standards.* With the exception of data that must be mandatorily reported on Physician Compare, for each program year, CMS relies on established public reporting standards to guide the information available for inclusion on Physician Compare. The public reporting standards require data included on Physician Compare to be statistically valid, reliable, and accurate; comparable across collection types; and meet the reliability threshold. And, to be included on the public facing profile pages, the data must also resonate with website users, as determined by CMS.

(c) *First year measures.* For each program year, CMS does not publicly report any first year measure for the first 2 years, meaning any measure in its first 2 years of use in the quality and cost performance categories. After the first 2 years, CMS reevaluates measures to determine when and if they are suitable for public reporting.

(d) *30-day preview period.* For each program year, CMS provides a 30-day preview period for any clinician or group with Quality Payment Program data before the data are publicly reported on Physician Compare.
