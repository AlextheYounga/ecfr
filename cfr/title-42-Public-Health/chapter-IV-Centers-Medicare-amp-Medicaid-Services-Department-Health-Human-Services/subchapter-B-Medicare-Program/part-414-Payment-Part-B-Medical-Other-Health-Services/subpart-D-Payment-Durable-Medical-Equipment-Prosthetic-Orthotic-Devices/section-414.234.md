##### § 414.234 Prior authorization for items frequently subject to unnecessary utilization. #####

(a) *Definitions.* For the purpose of this section, the following definitions apply:

*Prior authorization* is a process through which a request for provisional affirmation of coverage is submitted to CMS or its contractors for review before the item is furnished to the beneficiary and before the claim is submitted for processing.

*Provisional affirmation* is a preliminary finding that a future claim meets Medicare's coverage, coding, and payment rules.

*Unnecessary utilization* means the furnishing of items that do not comply with one or more of Medicare's coverage, coding, and payment rules.

(b) *Master list of items frequently subject to unnecessary utilization.* (1) The Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization includes items listed on the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies fee schedule with an average purchase fee of $1,000 (adjusted annually for inflation using consumer price index for all urban consumers (CPI-U)) or greater or an average rental fee schedule of $100 (adjusted annually for inflation using CPI-U) or greater that also meet one of the following two criteria:

(i) The item has been identified as having a high rate of fraud or unnecessary utilization in a report that is national in scope from 2007 or later published by any of the following:

(A) The Office of Inspector General (OIG).

(B) The General Accountability Office (GAO).

(ii) The item is listed in the 2011 or later Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program's Annual Medicare Fee-For-Service (FFS) Improper Payment Rate Report DME and/or DMEPOS Service Specific Report(s).

(2) The Master List of DMEPOS Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization is self-updating annually and is published in the Federal Register.

(3) DMEPOS items identified as having a high rate of fraud or unnecessary utilization in any of the following reports that are national in scope and meeting the payment threshold criteria set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section are added to the Master List:

(i) OIG reports published after 2015.

(ii) GAO reports published after 2015.

(iii) CERT program's Annual Medicare FFS Improper Payment Rate Report DME and/or DMEPOS Service Specific Report(s) published after 2015, also referred to as the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT) program's Annual Medicare FFS Improper Payment Rate Report DME Service Specific Report(s).

(4) Items remain on the Master List for 10 years from the date the item was added to the Master List.

(5) Items that are discontinued or are no longer covered by Medicare are removed from the Master List.

(6) An item is removed from the list if the purchase amount drops below the payment threshold (an average purchase fee of $1,000 or greater or an average monthly rental fee schedule of $100 or greater).

(7) An item is removed from the Master List and replaced by its equivalent when the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code representing the item has been discontinued and cross-walked to an equivalent item.

(c) *Condition of payment* - (1) *Items requiring prior authorization.* CMS publishes in the Federal Register and posts on the CMS Prior Authorization Web site a list of items, the Required Prior Authorization List, that require prior authorization as a condition of payment.

(i) The Required Prior Authorization List specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is selected from the Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization (as described in paragraph (b) of this section). CMS may consider factors such as geographic location, item utilization or cost, system capabilities, administrative burden, emerging trends, vulnerabilities identified in official agency reports, or other data analysis.

(ii) CMS may elect to limit the prior authorization requirement to a particular region of the country if claims data analysis shows that unnecessary utilization of the selected item(s) is concentrated in a particular region.

(iii) The Required Prior Authorization List is effective no less than 60 days after publication and posting.

(2) *Denial of claims.* (i) CMS or its contractors denies a claim for an item that requires prior authorization if the claim has not received a provisional affirmation.

(ii) Claims receiving a provisional affirmation may be denied based on either of the following:

(A) Technical requirements that can only be evaluated after the claim has been submitted for formal processing.

(B) Information not available at the time of a prior authorization request.

(d) *Submission of prior authorization requests.* A prior authorization request must do the following:

(1) Include all relevant documentation necessary to show that the item meets applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules, including all of the following:

(i) Order.

(ii) Relevant information from the beneficiary's medical record.

(iii) Relevant supplier produced documentation.

(2) Be submitted before the item is furnished to the beneficiary and before the claim is submitted for processing.

(e) *Review of prior authorization requests.* (1) After receipt of a prior authorization request, CMS or its contractor reviews the prior authorization request for compliance with applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules.

(2) If applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules are met, CMS or its contractor issues a provisional affirmation to the requester.

(3)(i) If applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules are not met, CMS or its contractor issues a non-affirmation decision to the requester.

(ii) If the requester receives a non-affirmation decision, the requester may resubmit a prior authorization request before the item is furnished to the beneficiary and before the claim is submitted for processing.

(4) *Expedited reviews.* (i) A prior authorization request for an expedited review must include documentation that shows that processing a prior authorization request using a standard timeline for review could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the beneficiary or the beneficiary's ability to regain maximum function.

(ii) If CMS or its contractor agrees that processing a prior authorization request using a standard timeline for review could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the beneficiary or the beneficiary's ability to regain maximum function, then CMS or its contractor expedites the review of the prior authorization request and communicates the decision following the receipt of all applicable Medicare required documentation.

(f) *Suspension of prior authorization requests.* (1) CMS may suspend prior authorization requirements generally or for a particular item or items at any time and without undertaking rulemaking.

(2) CMS provides notification of the suspension of the prior authorization requirements via -

(i) Federal Register notice; and

(ii) Posting on the CMS prior authorization Web site.
