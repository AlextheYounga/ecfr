(4) Items remain on the Master List for 10 years from the date the item was added to the Master List.

(5) Items that are discontinued or are no longer covered by Medicare are removed from the Master List.

(6) An item is removed from the list if the purchase amount drops below the payment threshold (an average purchase fee of $1,000 or greater or an average monthly rental fee schedule of $100 or greater).

(7) An item is removed from the Master List and replaced by its equivalent when the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code representing the item has been discontinued and cross-walked to an equivalent item.

(c) *Condition of payment* - (1) *Items requiring prior authorization.* CMS publishes in the Federal Register and posts on the CMS Prior Authorization Web site a list of items, the Required Prior Authorization List, that require prior authorization as a condition of payment.

(i) The Required Prior Authorization List specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section is selected from the Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization (as described in paragraph (b) of this section). CMS may consider factors such as geographic location, item utilization or cost, system capabilities, administrative burden, emerging trends, vulnerabilities identified in official agency reports, or other data analysis.

(ii) CMS may elect to limit the prior authorization requirement to a particular region of the country if claims data analysis shows that unnecessary utilization of the selected item(s) is concentrated in a particular region.

(iii) The Required Prior Authorization List is effective no less than 60 days after publication and posting.

(2) *Denial of claims.* (i) CMS or its contractors denies a claim for an item that requires prior authorization if the claim has not received a provisional affirmation.

(ii) Claims receiving a provisional affirmation may be denied based on either of the following:

(A) Technical requirements that can only be evaluated after the claim has been submitted for formal processing.

(B) Information not available at the time of a prior authorization request.

(d) *Submission of prior authorization requests.* A prior authorization request must do the following:

(ii) Relevant information from the beneficiary's medical record.

(iii) Relevant supplier produced documentation.

(2) Be submitted before the item is furnished to the beneficiary and before the claim is submitted for processing.

(e) *Review of prior authorization requests.* (1) After receipt of a prior authorization request, CMS or its contractor reviews the prior authorization request for compliance with applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules.

(2) If applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules are met, CMS or its contractor issues a provisional affirmation to the requester.

(3)(i) If applicable Medicare coverage, coding, and payment rules are not met, CMS or its contractor issues a non-affirmation decision to the requester.

(ii) If the requester receives a non-affirmation decision, the requester may resubmit a prior authorization request before the item is furnished to the beneficiary and before the claim is submitted for processing.

(4) *Expedited reviews.* (i) A prior authorization request for an expedited review must include documentation that shows that processing a prior authorization request using a standard timeline for review could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the beneficiary or the beneficiary's ability to regain maximum function.

(ii) If CMS or its contractor agrees that processing a prior authorization request using a standard timeline for review could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the beneficiary or the beneficiary's ability to regain maximum function, then CMS or its contractor expedites the review of the prior authorization request and communicates the decision following the receipt of all applicable Medicare required documentation.

(f) *Suspension of prior authorization requests.* (1) CMS may suspend prior authorization requirements generally or for a particular item or items at any time and without undertaking rulemaking.
