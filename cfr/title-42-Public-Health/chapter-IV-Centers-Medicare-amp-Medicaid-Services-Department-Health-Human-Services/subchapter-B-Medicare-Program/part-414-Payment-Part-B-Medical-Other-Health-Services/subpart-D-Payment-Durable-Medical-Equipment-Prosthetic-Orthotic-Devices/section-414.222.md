##### § 414.222 Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 57071, Nov. 14, 2018.

(a) *Definition.* Items requiring frequent and substantial servicing in order to avoid risk to the beneficiary's health are the following:

(1) Ventilators (except those that are either continuous airway pressure devices or respiratory assist devices with bi-level pressure capability with or without a backup rate, previously referred to as “intermittent assist devices with continuous airway pressure devices”).

(2) Continuous and intermittent positive pressure breathing machines.

(3) Continuous passive motion machines.

(4) Other items specified in CMS program instructions.

(5) Other items identified by the carrier.

(b) *Payment rule.* Rental payments for items requiring frequent and substantial servicing are made on a monthly basis, and continue until medical necessity ends.

(c) *Fee schedule amount for 1989 and 1990.* The fee schedule amount for items requiring frequent and substantial servicing is the local payment amount determined as follows:

(1) The carrier determines the average reasonable charge for rental of items requiring frequent and substantial servicing that were furnished during the period July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987 based on the mean of the carrier's allowed charges for the item.

(2) The carrier adjusts the amounts determined under paragraph (c)(1) of this section by the change in the level of the CPI-U for the 6-month period ending December 1987.

(d) *Updating the fee schedule amounts for years after 1990.* For years after 1990, the fee schedules are determined using the methodology contained in paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of § 414.220.

(e) *Transition to other payment classes.* For purposes of calculating the 15-month rental period, beginning January 1, 1994, if an item has been paid for under the frequent and substantial servicing class and is subsequently paid for under another payment class, the rental period begins with the first month of continuous rental, even if that period began before January 1, 1994. For example, if the rental period began on July 1, 1993, the carrier must use this date as beginning the first month of rental. Likewise, for purposes of calculating the 10-month purchase option, the rental period begins with the first month of continuous rental without regard to when that period started. For example, if the rental period began in August 1993, the 10-month purchase option must be offered to the beneficiary in May 1994, the tenth month of continuous rental.
