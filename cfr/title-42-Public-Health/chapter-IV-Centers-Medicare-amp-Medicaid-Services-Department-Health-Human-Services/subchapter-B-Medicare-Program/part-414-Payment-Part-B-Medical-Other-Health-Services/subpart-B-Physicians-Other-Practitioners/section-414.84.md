(a) *Definitions.* In addition to the definitions specified at § 410.79(b) and § 424.205(a) of this chapter, the following definitions apply to this section.

*Bridge payment* means a one-time payment to an MDPP supplier for furnishing its first MDPP session to an MDPP beneficiary who has previously received one or more MDPP services from a different MDPP supplier.

*Performance goal* means an attendance or weight loss goal that an MDPP beneficiary must achieve during the MDPP services period for an MDPP supplier to be paid a performance payment.

*Performance payment* means a payment made to an MDPP supplier for furnishing certain MDPP services to an MDPP beneficiary when the MDPP beneficiary achieves the applicable performance goal.

(b) *Performance payment.* CMS makes one or more types of performance payments to an MDPP supplier as specified in this paragraph (b). Each type of performance payment is made only if the beneficiary achieves the applicable performance goal and only once per MDPP beneficiary. A performance payment is made only on an assignment-related basis in accordance with § 424.55 of this chapter, and MDPP suppliers must accept the Medicare allowed charge as payment in full and may not bill or collect from the beneficiary any amount. CMS will make a performance payment only to an MDPP supplier that complies with all applicable enrollment and program requirements and only for MDPP services that are furnished by an eligible coach, on or after his or her coach eligibility start date and, if applicable, before his or her coach eligibility end date. As a condition of payment, the MDPP supplier must report the NPI of the coach who furnished the session on the claim for the MDPP session. The seven types of performance payments are as follows:

(1) *Performance Goal 1: Attends the first core session that initiates the MDPP services period.* CMS makes a performance payment to an MDPP supplier if an MDPP beneficiary attends the first core session, which initiates the MDPP services period, and that first core session was furnished by that supplier. An MDPP supplier that has been paid this performance payment for an MDPP beneficiary is not eligible to be paid a bridge payment described in paragraph (c) of this section for that MDPP beneficiary. The amount of this performance payment is determined as follows:

(i) For a first core session furnished April 1 through December 31, 2018. $25.
