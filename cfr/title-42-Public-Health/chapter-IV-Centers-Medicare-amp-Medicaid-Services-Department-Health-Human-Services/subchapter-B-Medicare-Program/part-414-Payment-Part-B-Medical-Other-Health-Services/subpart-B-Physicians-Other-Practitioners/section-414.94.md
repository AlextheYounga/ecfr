Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 79531, Nov. 16, 2023.

(a) *Basis and scope*. This section implements the following provisions of the Act:

(1) Section 1834(q)—Recognizing Appropriate Use Criteria for Certain Imaging Services.

(2) Section 1834(q)(1)—Program Established.

(3) Section 1834(q)(2)—Establishment of Applicable Appropriate Use Criteria.

(b) *Definitions*. As used in this section unless otherwise indicated—

*Advanced diagnostic imaging service* means an imaging service as defined in section 1834(e)(1)(B) of the Act.

*Applicable imaging service* means an advanced diagnostic imaging service (as defined in section 1834(e)(1)(B) of the Act) for which the Secretary determines—

(i) One or more applicable appropriate use criteria apply;

(ii) There are one or more qualified clinical decision support mechanisms listed; and

(iii) One or more of such mechanisms is available free of charge.

*Applicable payment system* means the following:

(i) The physician fee schedule established under section 1848(b) of the Act;

(ii) The prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services under section 1833(t) of the Act; and

(iii) The ambulatory surgical center payment systems under section 1833(i) of the Act.

*Applicable setting* means a physician's office, a hospital outpatient department (including an emergency department), an ambulatory surgical center, an independent diagnostic testing facility, and any other provider-led outpatient setting determined appropriate by the Secretary.

*Appropriate use criteria (AUC)* means criteria only developed or endorsed by national professional medical specialty societies or other provider-led entities, to assist ordering professionals and furnishing professionals in making the most appropriate treatment decision for a specific clinical condition for an individual. To the extent feasible, such criteria must be evidence-based. An AUC set is a collection of individual appropriate use criteria. An individual criterion is information presented in a manner that links: a specific clinical condition or presentation; one or more services; and, an assessment of the appropriateness of the service(s).

*Clinical decision support mechanism (CDSM)* means the following: an interactive, electronic tool for use by clinicians that communicates AUC information to the user and assists them in making the most appropriate treatment decision for a patient's specific clinical condition. Tools may be modules within or available through certified EHR technology (as defined in section 1848(o)(4)) of the Act or private sector mechanisms independent from certified EHR technology or established by the Secretary.

*Furnishing professional* means a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act) or a practitioner described in section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Act who furnishes an applicable imaging service.

*Ordering professional* means a physician (as defined in section 1861(r) of the Act) or a practitioner described in section 1842(b)(18)(C) of the Act who orders an applicable imaging service.

*Priority clinical areas* means clinical conditions, diseases or symptom complexes and associated advanced diagnostic imaging services identified by CMS through annual rulemaking and in consultation with stakeholders which may be used in the determination of outlier ordering professionals.

*Provider-led entity (PLE)* means a national professional medical specialty society or other organization that is comprised primarily of providers or practitioners who, either within the organization or outside of the organization, predominantly provide direct patient care.

*Specified applicable appropriate use criteria* means any individual appropriate use criterion or AUC set developed, modified or endorsed by a qualified PLE.

(c) *Qualified provider-led entity*. To be qualified by CMS, a PLE must adhere to the evidence-based processes described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section when developing or modifying AUC. A qualified PLE may develop AUC, modify AUC developed by another qualified PLE, or endorse AUC developed by other qualified PLEs.

(1) *Requirements for qualified PLEs developing or modifying AUC*. A PLE must perform all of the following when developing or modifying AUC:

(i) Utilize an evidentiary review process when developing or modifying AUC that includes:

(A) A systematic literature review of the clinical topic and relevant imaging studies; and

(B) An assessment of the evidence using a formal, published and widely recognized methodology for grading evidence. Consideration of relevant published consensus statements by professional medical specialty societies must be part of the evidence assessment.

(ii) Utilize at least one multidisciplinary team with autonomous governance, decision-making and accountability for developing or modifying AUC. At a minimum the team must be comprised of seven members including at least one practicing physician with expertise in the clinical topic related to the appropriate use criterion being developed or modified, at least one practicing physician with expertise in the imaging studies related to the appropriate use criterion, at least one primary care physician or practitioner as described in sections 1833(u)(6), 1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(I), and 1833(x)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, at least one expert in statistical analysis and at least one expert in clinical trial design. A given team member may be the team's expert in more than one domain.

(iii) Utilize a publicly transparent process for identifying potential conflicts of interest and for resolving conflicts of interest of members on the multidisciplinary team, the PLE and any other party participating in AUC development or modification, to include recusal or exclusion of individuals as appropriate. The PLE must document the following information and make it available in timely fashion to a public request, for a period of not less than 5 years after the most recent published update of the relevant AUC:

(A) Direct or indirect financial relationships that exist between individuals or the spouse or minor child of individuals who have substantively participated in the development of AUC and companies or organizations including the PLE and any other party participating in AUC development or modification that may financially benefit from the AUC. These financial relationships may include, for example, compensation arrangements such as salary, grant, speaking or consulting fees, contract, or collaboration agreements.

(B) Ownership or investment interests between individuals or the spouse or minor child of individuals who have substantively participated in the development of AUC and companies or organizations including the PLE or any other party participating in AUC development or modification that may financially benefit from the AUC.

(iv) Publish each individual criterion on the PLE's Web site and include an identifying title, authors (at a minimum, all members of the multidisciplinary AUC development team must be listed as authors), and key references used to establish the evidence.

(v) Identify each appropriate use criterion or AUC subset that are relevant to a priority clinical area with a statement on the PLE's Web site. To be identified as being relevant to a priority clinical area, the criterion or AUC subset must reasonably address the entire clinical scope of the corresponding priority clinical area.

(vi) Identify key points in an individual criterion as evidence-based or consensus-based, and grade such key points in terms of strength of evidence using a formal, published and widely recognized methodology.

(vii) Utilize a transparent process for the timely and continual updating of each criterion. Each criterion must be reviewed and, when appropriate, updated at least annually.

(viii) Publicly post the process for developing or modifying the AUC on the PLE's Web site.

(ix) Disclose parties external to the PLE when such parties have involvement in the AUC development process.

(2) *Process to identify qualifying PLEs*. PLEs must meet all of the following criteria:

(i) PLEs must submit an application to CMS for review that documents adherence to each of the AUC development requirements outlined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section;

(ii) Applications will be accepted by CMS only from PLEs that meet the definition of PLE in paragraph (b) of this section;

(iii) Applications must be received by CMS annually by January 1;

(iv) All approved qualified PLEs in each year will be included on the list of qualified PLEs posted to the CMS Web site by June 30 of that year; and
