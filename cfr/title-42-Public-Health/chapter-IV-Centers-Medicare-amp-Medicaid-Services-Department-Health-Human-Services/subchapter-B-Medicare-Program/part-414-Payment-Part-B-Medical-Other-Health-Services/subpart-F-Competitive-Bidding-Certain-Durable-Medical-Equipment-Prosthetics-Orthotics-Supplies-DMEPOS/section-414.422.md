(i) A successor entity -

(A) Meets all requirements applicable to contract suppliers for the applicable competitive bidding program;

(B) Submits to CMS the documentation described under § 414.414(b) through (d) if documentation has not previously been submitted by the successor entity or if the documentation is no longer sufficient for CMS to make a financial determination.

(1) A contract supplier must agree to furnish items under its contract to any beneficiary who maintains a permanent residence in, or who visits, the CBA and who requests those items from that contract supplier.

(2) A skilled nursing facility defined under section 1819(a) of the Act or a nursing facility defined under section 1919(a) of the Act that has elected to furnish items only to its own residents and that is also a contract supplier may furnish items under a competitive bidding program to its own patients to whom it would otherwise furnish Part B services.
