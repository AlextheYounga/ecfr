Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 47853, Sept. 10, 2019.

(a) *Reasons for denial.* CMS may deny a provider's or supplier's enrollment in the Medicare program for the following reasons:

(1) *Noncompliance.* The provider or supplier is determined to not be in compliance with the enrollment requirements in this subpart P or in the enrollment application applicable for its provider or supplier type, and has not submitted a plan of corrective action as outlined in part 488 of this chapter.

(2) *Provider or supplier conduct.* A provider, supplier, an owner, managing employee, an authorized or delegated official, medical director, supervising physician, or other health care personnel furnishing Medicare reimbursable services who is required to be reported on the enrollment application, in accordance with section 1862(e)(1) of the Act, is -

(i) Excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid and any other Federal health care programs, as defined in § 1001.2 of this chapter, in accordance with section 1128, 1128A, 1156, 1842, 1862, 1867 or 1892 of the Act.

(ii) Debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded from participating in any other Federal procurement or nonprocurement activity in accordance with section 2455 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA).

(3) *Felonies.* The provider, supplier, or any owner or managing employee of the provider or supplier was, within the preceding 10 years, convicted (as that term is defined in 42 CFR 1001.2) of a Federal or State felony offense that CMS determines is detrimental to the best interests of the Medicare program and its beneficiaries.

(i) Offenses include, but are not limited in scope or severity to -

(A) Felony crimes against persons, such as murder, rape, assault, and other similar crimes for which the individual was convicted, including guilty pleas and adjudicated pretrial diversions.

(B) Financial crimes, such as extortion, embezzlement, income tax evasion, insurance fraud and other similar crimes for which the individual was convicted, including guilty pleas and adjudicated pretrial diversions.

(C) Any felony that placed the Medicare program or its beneficiaries at immediate risk, such as a malpractice suit that results in a conviction of criminal neglect or misconduct.

(D) Any felonies that would result in mandatory exclusion under section 1128(a) of the Act.

(ii) Denials based on felony convictions are for a period to be determined by the Secretary, but not less than 10 years from the date of conviction if the individual has been convicted on one previous occasion for one or more offenses.

(4) *False or misleading information.* The provider or supplier has submitted false or misleading information on the enrollment application to gain enrollment in the Medicare program. (Offenders may be referred to the Office of Inspector General for investigation and possible criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions.)

(5) *On-site review.* Upon on-site review or other reliable evidence, CMS determines that the provider or supplier:

(i) Is not operational to furnish Medicare-covered items or services; or

(ii) Otherwise fails to satisfy any Medicare enrollment requirement.

(6) *Medicare debt.* (i) The enrolling provider, supplier, or owner thereof (as defined in § 424.502), has an existing Medicare debt.

(ii) The enrolling provider, supplier, or owner (as defined in § 424.502) thereof was previously the owner (as defined in § 424.502) of a provider or supplier that had a Medicare debt that existed when the latter's enrollment was voluntarily terminated, involuntarily terminated, or revoked, and all of the following criteria are met:

(A) The owner left the provider or supplier with the Medicare debt within 1 year before or after that provider or supplier's voluntary termination, involuntary termination or revocation.

(B) The Medicare debt has not been fully repaid.

(C) CMS determines that the uncollected debt poses an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse. In making this determination, CMS considers the following factors:

(*1*) The amount of the Medicare debt.

(*2*) The length and timeframe that the enrolling provider, supplier, or owner thereof was an owner of the prior entity.

(*3*) The percentage of the enrolling provider, supplier, or owner's ownership of the prior entity.

(*4*) Whether the Medicare debt is currently being appealed.

(*5*) Whether the enrolling provider, supplier, or owner thereof was an owner of the prior entity at the time the Medicare debt was incurred.

(iii) A denial of Medicare enrollment under this paragraph (a)(6) can be avoided if the enrolling provider, supplier or owner thereof does either of the following:

(A)(*1*) Satisfies the criteria set forth in § 401.607; and

(*2*) Agrees to a CMS-approved extended repayment schedule for the entire outstanding Medicare debt.

(B) Repays the debt in full.

(7) *Payment suspension.* The current owner (as defined in § 424.502), physician or nonphysician practitioner has been placed under a Medicare payment suspension as defined in § 405.370 through § 405.372 of this subchapter.

(8) *Initial Reserve Operating Funds.* (i) CMS or its designated Medicare contractor may deny Medicare billing privileges if, within 30 days of a CMS or Medicare contractor request, a home health agency (HHA) cannot furnish supporting documentation which verifies that the HHA meets the initial reserve operating funds requirement found in § 489.28(a) of this title.

(ii) CMS may deny Medicare billing privileges upon an HHA applicant's failure to satisfy the initial reserve operating funds requirement found in 42 CFR 489.28(a).

(9) *Application fee/hardship exception.* An institutional provider's or supplier's hardship exception request is not granted, and the provider or supplier does not submit the application fee within 30 days of notification that the hardship exception request was not approved.

(10) *Temporary moratorium.* A provider or supplier submits an enrollment application for a practice location in a geographic area where CMS has imposed a temporary moratorium.

(11) *Prescribing authority.* (i) A physician or eligible professional's Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Certificate of Registration to dispense a controlled substance is currently suspended or revoked; or

(ii) The applicable licensing or administrative body for any State in which a physician or eligible professional practices has suspended or revoked the physician or eligible professional's ability to prescribe drugs, and such suspension or revocation is in effect on the date the physician or eligible professional submits his or her enrollment application to the Medicare contractor.

(b) *Resubmission after denial.* A provider or supplier that is denied enrollment in the Medicare program cannot submit a new enrollment application until the following has occurred if the denial:

(1) Was not appealed, the provider or supplier may reapply after its appeal rights have lapsed.

(2) Was appealed, the provider or supplier may reapply after notification that the determination was upheld.

(c) *Reversal of denial.* If the denial was due to adverse activity (sanction, exclusion, debt, felony) of an owner, managing employee, an authorized or delegated official, medical director, supervising physician, or other health care personnel of the provider or supplier furnishing Medicare reimbursable services, the denial may be reversed if the provider or supplier terminates and submits proof that it has terminated its business relationship with that individual or organization within 30 days of the denial notification.

(d) *Additional review.* When a provider or supplier is denied enrollment in Medicare, CMS automatically reviews all other related Medicare enrollment files that the denied provider or supplier has an association with (for example, as an owner or managing employee) to determine if the denial warrants an adverse action of the associated Medicare provider or supplier.

(e) *Effective date of denial.* Denial becomes effective within 30 days of the initial denial notification.
