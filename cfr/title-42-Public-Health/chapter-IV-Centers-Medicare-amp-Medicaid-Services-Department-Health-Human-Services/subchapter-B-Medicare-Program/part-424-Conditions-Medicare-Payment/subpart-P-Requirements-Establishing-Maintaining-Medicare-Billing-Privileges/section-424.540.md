##### § 424.540 Deactivation of Medicare billing privileges. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 47856, Sept. 10, 2019.

(a) *Reasons for deactivation.* CMS may deactivate the Medicare billing privileges of a provider or supplier for any of the following reasons:

(1) The provider or supplier does not submit any Medicare claims for 12 consecutive calendar months. The 12 month period will begin the 1st day of the 1st month without a claims submission through the last day of the 12th month without a submitted claim.

(2) The provider or supplier does not report a change to the information supplied on the enrollment application within 90 calendar days of when the change occurred. Changes that must be reported include, but are not limited to, a change in practice location, a change of any managing employee, and a change in billing services. A change in ownership or control must be reported within 30 calendar days as specified in §§ 424.520(b) and 424.550(b).

(3) The provider or supplier does not furnish complete and accurate information and all supporting documentation within 90 calendar days of receipt of notification from CMS to submit an enrollment application and supporting documentation, or resubmit and certify to the accuracy of its enrollment information.

(b) *Reactivation of billing privileges.* (1) When deactivated for any reason other than nonsubmission of a claim, the provider or supplier must complete and submit a new enrollment application to reactivate its Medicare billing privileges or, when deemed appropriate, at a minimum, recertify that the enrollment information currently on file with Medicare is correct.

(2) Providers and suppliers deactivated for nonsubmission of a claim are required to recertify that the enrollment information currently on file with Medicare is correct and furnish any missing information as appropriate. The provider or supplier must meet all current Medicare requirements in place at the time of reactivation, and be prepared to submit a valid Medicare claim.

(3) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, reactivation of Medicare billing privileges does not require a new certification of the provider or supplier by the State survey agency or the establishment of a new provider agreement.

(i) An HHA whose Medicare billing privileges are deactivated under the provisions found at paragraph (a) of this section must obtain an initial State survey or accreditation by an approved accreditation organization before its Medicare billing privileges can be reactivated.

(ii) [Reserved]

(c) *Effect of deactivation.* Deactivation of Medicare billing privileges is considered an action to protect the provider or supplier from misuse of its billing number and to protect the Medicare Trust Funds from unnecessary overpayments. The deactivation of Medicare billing privileges does not have any effect on a provider or supplier's participation agreement or any conditions of participation.
