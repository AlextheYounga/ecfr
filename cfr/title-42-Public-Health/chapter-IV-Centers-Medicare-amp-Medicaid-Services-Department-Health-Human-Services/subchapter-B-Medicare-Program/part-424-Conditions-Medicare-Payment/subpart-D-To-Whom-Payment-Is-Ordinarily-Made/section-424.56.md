##### ยง 424.56 Payment to a beneficiary and to a supplier. #####

(a) *Conditions for split payment.* If the beneficiary assigns the claim after paying part of the bill, payment may be made partly to the beneficiary and partly to the supplier.

(b) *Payment to the supplier.* Payment to the supplier who submits the assigned claim is for whichever of the following amounts is less:

(1) The reasonable charge minus the amount the beneficiary had already paid to the supplier; or

(2) The full Part B benefit due for the services furnished.

(c) *Payment to the beneficiary.* Any part of the Part B benefit which, on the basis of paragraph (b) of this section, is not payable to the supplier, is paid to the beneficiary.

(d) *Examples.*

Example 1.An assigned bill of $300 on which partial payment of $100 has been made is submitted to the carrier. The carrier determines that $300 is the reasonable charge for the service furnished. Total payment due is 80 percent of $300 or $240. Of this amount, $200 (the difference between the $100 partial payment and the $300 reasonable charge) is paid to the supplier. The remaining $40 is paid to the beneficiary.Example 2.An assigned bill of $325 on which partial payment of $275 has been made is submitted to the carrier. The carrier determines that $275 is the reasonable charge for the services. Total payment due is 80 percent of $275 or $220. The $220 is paid to the beneficiary, since any payment to the supplier, when added to the $275 partial payment would exceed the reasonable charge for the services furnished.[53 FR 6641, Mar. 2, 1988; 53 FR 12945, Apr. 20, 1988]
