(1) The nature of the conduct.

(2) The degree of culpability of the Part D sponsor.

(3) The adverse effect to enrollees which resulted or could have resulted from the conduct of the Part D sponsor.

(4) The financial condition of the Part D sponsor.

(5) The history of prior offenses by the Part D sponsor or principals of the Part D sponsor.

(6) Such other matters as justice may require.

(b) *Amount of penalty.* CMS may impose civil money penalties in the following amounts:

(1) If the deficiency on which the determination is based has directly adversely affected (or has the substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) one or more Part D enrollees - up to $25,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 for each determination.

(2) If the deficiency on which the determination is based has directly adversely affected (or has the substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) one or more Part D enrollees, CMS may calculate a CMP of up to $25,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 for each Part D enrollee directly adversely affected (or with a substantial likelihood of being adversely affected) by a deficiency .

(3) For each week that a deficiency remains uncorrected after the week in which the Part D sponsor receives CMS' notice of the determination - up to $10,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102.

(4) If CMS makes a determination that a Part D sponsor has terminated its contract other than in a manner described under 423.510 and that the Part D sponsor has therefore failed to substantially carry out the terms of the contract, $250 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 per Medicare enrollee from the terminated Part D sponsor or plans at the time the Part D sponsor terminated its contract, or $100,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102, whichever is greater.

(3) Plus with respect to a determination made under § 423.752(a)(2), double the excess amount charged in violation of such paragraph (and the excess amount charged must be deducted from the penalty and returned to the individual concerned).

(4) Plus with respect to a determination made under § 423.752(a)(4), $15,000 as adjusted annually under 45 CFR part 102 for each individual not enrolled as a result of the practice involved.
