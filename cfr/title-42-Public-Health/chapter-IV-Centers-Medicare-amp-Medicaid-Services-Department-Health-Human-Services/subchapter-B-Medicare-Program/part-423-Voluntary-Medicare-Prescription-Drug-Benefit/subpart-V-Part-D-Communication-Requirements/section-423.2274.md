(7) Submit agent or broker marketing materials to CMS through HPMS prior to use, following the requirements for marketing materials in this subpart.

(8) Ensure beneficiaries are not charged marketing consulting fees when considering enrollment in Part D plans.

(9) Establish and maintain a system for confirming that:

(ii) Part D sponsors must pay pro-rated initial enrollment year compensation for:

(A) A beneficiary's plan change(s) during their initial enrollment year.

(B) A beneficiary's selection of an “unlike plan type” change. In that case, the new plan would only pay the months that the beneficiary is enrolled, and the previous plan would recoup the months that the beneficiary was not in the plan.

(3) *Renewal compensation.* For each enrollment in a renewal year, Part D sponsors may pay compensation at an amount up to 50 percent of FMV.

(i) Part D sponsors may pay compensation for a renewal year:

(ii) When a beneficiary enrolls in both a section 1876 Cost Plan and a stand-alone PDP, the 1876 Cost Plan sponsor may pay compensation for the cost plan enrollment and the Part D sponsor must pay compensation for the Part D enrollment.

(iii) When a beneficiary enrolls in a MA-only plan and a PDP, the MA plan may pay for the MA plan enrollment and the Part D sponsor may pay for the PDP enrollment.

(5) *Additional compensation, payment, and compensation recovery requirements (Charge-backs).* (i) Part D sponsors must retroactively pay or recoup funds for retroactive beneficiary changes for the current and previous calendar years. Part D sponsors may choose to recoup or pay compensation for years prior to the previous calendar year, but they must do both (recoup amounts owed and pay amounts due) during the same year.

(ii) Compensation recovery is required when:

(A) A beneficiary makes any plan change (regardless of the parent organization) within the first three months of enrollment (known as rapid disenrollment), except as provided in paragraph (d)(5)(iii) of this section.

(B) Any other time period a beneficiary is not enrolled in a plan, but the plan paid compensation based on that time period.

(iii) Rapid disenrollment compensation recovery does not apply when:

(A) A beneficiary enrolls effective October 1, November 1, or December 1 and subsequently uses the Annual Election Period to change plans for an effective date of January 1.

(B) A beneficiary's enrollment change is not in the best interests of the Medicare program, including for the following reasons:

(*1*) Other creditable coverage *(*for example, an employer plan).

(*2*) Moving into or out of an institution.

(*3*) Gain or loss of employer/union sponsored coverage.

(*4*) Plan termination, non-renewal, or CMS imposed sanction.

(*5*) To coordinate with Part D enrollment periods or the State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program.

(*6*) Becoming LIS or dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.

(*7*) Qualifying for another plan based on special needs.

(*8*) Due to an auto, facilitated, or passive enrollment.

(*9*) Death.

(*10*) Moving out of the service area.

(*11*) Non-payment of premium.

(*12*) Loss of entitlement or retroactive notice of entitlement.

(*13*) Moving into a 5-star plan.

(iv)(A) When rapid disenrollment compensation recovery applies, the entire compensation must be recovered.

(B) For other compensation recovery, plans must recover a pro-rated amount of compensation (whether paid for an initial enrollment year or renewal year) from an agent or broker equal to the number of months not enrolled.

(*1*) If a plan has paid full initial compensation, and the enrollee disenrolls prior to the end of the enrollment year, the total number of months not enrolled (including months prior to the effective date of enrollment) must be recovered from the agent or broker.

(*2*) Example: A beneficiary enrolls upon turning 65 effective April 1 and disenrolls September 30 of the same year. The plan paid full initial enrollment year compensation. Recovery is equal to 6/12ths of the initial enrollment year compensation (for January through March and October through December).

(e) *Payments other than compensation (administrative payments).* (1) Payments made for services other than enrollment of beneficiaries (for example, training, customer service, agent recruitment, operational overhead, or assistance with completion of health risk assessments) must not exceed the value of those services in the marketplace.

(2) Administrative payments can be based on enrollment provided payments are at or below the value of those services in the marketplace.

(f) *Payments for referrals.* Payments may be made to individuals for the referral (including a recommendation, provision, or other means of referring beneficiaries), recommendation, provision, or other means of referring beneficiaries to an agent, broker or other entity for potential enrollment into a plan. The payment may not exceed $100 for a referral into an MA or MA-PD plan and $25 for a referral into a PDP plan.
