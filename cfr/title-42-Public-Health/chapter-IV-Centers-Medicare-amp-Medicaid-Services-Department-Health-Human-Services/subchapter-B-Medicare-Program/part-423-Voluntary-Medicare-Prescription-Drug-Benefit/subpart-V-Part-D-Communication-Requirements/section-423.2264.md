##### § 423.2264 Guidelines for CMS review. #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 6124, Jan. 19, 2021.

In reviewing marketing material or election forms under § 423.2262, CMS determines that the materials -

(a) Provide to Medicare beneficiaries interested in enrolling, adequate written description of rules (including any limitations on the providers from whom services can be obtained), procedures, basic benefits and services, and fees and other charges in a format (and, where appropriate, print size) and using standard terminology that may be specified by CMS.

(b) Notify the general public of its enrollment period in an appropriate manner, through appropriate media, throughout its service area.

(c) Include in written materials notice that the Part D sponsor is authorized by law to refuse to renew its contract with CMS, that CMS also may refuse to renew the contract, and that termination or non-renewal may result in termination of the beneficiary's enrollment in the Part D plan. In addition, the Part D plan may reduce its service area and no longer be offered in the area where a beneficiary resides.

(d) Ensure that materials are not materially inaccurate or misleading or otherwise make material misrepresentations.
