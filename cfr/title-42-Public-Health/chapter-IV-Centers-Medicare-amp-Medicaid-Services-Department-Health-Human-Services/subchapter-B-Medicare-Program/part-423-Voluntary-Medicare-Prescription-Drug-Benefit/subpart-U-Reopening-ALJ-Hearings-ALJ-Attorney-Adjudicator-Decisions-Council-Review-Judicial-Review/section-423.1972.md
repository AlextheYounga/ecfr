(b) *When to file a request.* (1) Except when an ALJ or attorney adjudicator extends the timeframe as provided in § 423.2014(d), the enrollee must file a request for a hearing within 60 calendar days of receipt of the notice of an IRE reconsideration determination. The time and place for a hearing before an ALJ will be set in accordance with § 423.2020.

(2) For purposes of this section, the date of receipt of the reconsideration determination is presumed to be 5 calendar days after the date of the written reconsideration determination, unless there is evidence to the contrary.

(c) *Insufficient amount in controversy.* (1) If a request for a hearing clearly shows that the amount in controversy is less than that required under § 423.1970, the ALJ or attorney adjudicator dismisses the request.

(2) If, after a hearing is initiated, the ALJ finds that the amount in controversy is less than the amount required under § 423.1970, the ALJ discontinues the hearing and does not rule on the substantive issues raised in the appeal.
