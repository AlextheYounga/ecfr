##### ยง 423.2264 Guidelines for CMS review. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 16755, April 16, 2018.

In reviewing marketing material or enrollment forms under ยง 423.2262, CMS determines (unless otherwise specified in additional guidance) that the marketing materials -

(a) Provide, in a format (and, where appropriate, print size), and using standard terminology that may be specified by CMS, the following information to Medicare beneficiaries interested in enrolling:

(1) Adequate written description of rules (including any limitations on the providers from whom services can be obtained), procedures, basic benefits and services, and fees and other charges;

(2) Adequate written explanation of the grievance and appeals process, including differences between the two, and when it is appropriate to use each; and

(3) Any other information necessary to enable beneficiaries to make an informed decision about enrollment.

(b) Notify the general public of its enrollment period in an appropriate manner, through appropriate media, throughout its service area.

(c) Include in the written materials notice that the Part D plan is authorized by law to refuse to renew its contract with CMS, that CMS also may refuse to renew the contract, and that termination or non-renewal may result in termination of the beneficiary's enrollment in the Part D plan. In addition, the Part D plan may reduce its service area and no longer be offered in the area where a beneficiary resides.

(d) Ensure that materials are not materially inaccurate or misleading or otherwise make material misrepresentations.

(e) For markets with a significant non-English speaking population, provide materials in the language of these individuals. Specifically, Part D plan sponsors must translate marketing materials into any non-English language that is the primary language of at least 5 percent of the individuals in a plan benefit package (PBP) service area.
