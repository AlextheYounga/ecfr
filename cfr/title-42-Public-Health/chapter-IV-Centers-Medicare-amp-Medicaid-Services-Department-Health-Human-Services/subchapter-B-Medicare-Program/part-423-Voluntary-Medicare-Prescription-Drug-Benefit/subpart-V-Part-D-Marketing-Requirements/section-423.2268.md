Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 16755, April 16, 2018.

In conducting marketing activities, a Part D plan may not -

(a) Provide cash or other remuneration as an inducement for enrollment or otherwise.

(b) Offer gifts to potential enrollees, unless the gifts are of nominal (as defined in the CMS Marketing Guidelines) value, are offered to all potential enrollees without regard to whether or not the beneficiary enrolls, and are not in the form of cash or other monetary rebates.

(c) Engage in any discriminatory activity such as, for example, attempts to recruit Medicare beneficiaries from higher income areas without making comparable efforts to enroll Medicare beneficiaries from lower income areas.

(d) Solicit door-to-door for Medicare beneficiaries or through other unsolicited means of direct contact, including calling a beneficiary without the beneficiary initiating the contact.

(e) Engage in activities that could mislead or confuse Medicare beneficiaries, or misrepresent the Part D sponsor or its Part D plan. The Part D organization may not claim that it is recommended or endorsed by CMS or Medicare or that CMS or Medicare recommends that the beneficiary enroll in the Part D plan. The Part D organization may explain that the organization is approved for participation in Medicare.

(f) Market non-health care related products to prospective enrollees during any MA or Part D sales activity or presentation. This is considered cross-selling and is prohibited.

(g) Market any health care related product during a marketing appointment beyond the scope agreed upon by the beneficiary, and documented by the plan, prior to the appointment (48 hours in advance, when practicable).

(h) Market additional health related lines of plan business not identified prior to an individual appointment without a separate scope of appointment identifying the additional lines of business to be discussed.

(i) Distribute marketing materials for which, before expiration of the 45-day period, the PDP Sponsor receives from CMS written notice of disapproval because it is inaccurate or misleading, or misrepresents the PDP Sponsor, its marketing representatives, or CMS.

(j) Use providers, provider groups, or pharmacies to distribute printed information for beneficiaries to use when comparing the benefits of different Part D plans unless providers, provider groups or pharmacies accept and display materials from all Part D plan sponsors with which the providers, provider groups or pharmacies contract. The use of publicly available comparison information is permitted if approved by CMS in accordance with the Medicare marketing guidelines.

(k) Conduct sales presentations or distribute and accept Part D plan enrollment forms in provider offices, pharmacies or other areas where health care is delivered to individuals, except in the case where such activities are conducted in common areas in health care settings.

(l) Conduct sales presentations or distribute and accept plan applications at educational events.

(m) Employ Part D plan names that suggest that a plan is not available to all Medicare beneficiaries.

(n) Display the names and/or logos of co-branded network providers on the organization's member identification card. Other marketing materials (as defined in ยง 423.2260) that include names and/or logos of provider co-branding partners must clearly indicate that other providers are available in the network.

(o) Engage in any other marketing activity prohibited by CMS in its marketing guidance.

(p) Provide meals for potential enrollees, which are prohibited, regardless of value.

(q) Use a plan name that does not include the plan type. The plan type should be included at the end of the plan name.
