##### ยง 423.2106 Where a request for review may be filed. #####

When a request for a MAC review is filed after an ALJ has issued a written decision or dismissal, the request for review must be submitted to the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action. If the request for review is timely filed with an entity other than the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action, the MAC's adjudication period to conduct a review begins on the date the request for review is received by the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action. Upon receipt of a request for review from an entity other than the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action, the MAC sends written notice to the enrollee of the date of receipt of the request and commencement of the adjudication timeframe.
