Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 5137, Jan. 17, 2017.

(a)(1) An enrollee to the ALJ hearing may request a MAC review if the enrollee files a written request for a MAC review within 60 calendar days after receipt of the ALJ's written decision or dismissal.

(2) An enrollee may request that MAC review be expedited if the appeal involves an issue specified in ยง 423.566(b) but does not include solely a request for payment of Part D drugs already furnished.

(i) If an enrollee is requesting that the MAC review be expedited, the enrollee submits an oral or written request within 60 calendar days after the receipt of the ALJ's written decision or dismissal. A prescribing physician or other prescriber may provide oral or written support for an enrollee's request for expedited review.

(ii) The MAC must document all oral requests for expedited review in writing and maintain the documentation in the case files.

(3) For purposes of this section, the date of receipt of the ALJ's written decision or dismissal is presumed to be 5 calendar days after the date of the notice of the decision or dismissal, unless there is evidence to the contrary.

(4) The request is considered as filed on the date it is received by the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action.

(b) An enrollee requesting a review may ask that the time for filing a request for MAC review be extended if -

(1) The request for an extension of time is in writing or, for expedited reviews, in writing or oral. The MAC must document all oral requests in writing and maintain the documentation in the case file.

(2) The request explains why the request for review was not filed within the stated time period. If the MAC finds that there is good cause for missing the deadline, the time period will be extended. To determine whether good cause exists, the MAC uses the standards outlined at ยง 405.942(b)(2) and ยง 405.942(b)(3).

(c) An enrollee does not have the right to seek MAC review of an ALJ's remand or an ALJ's affirmation of an IRE's dismissal of a request for reconsideration.
