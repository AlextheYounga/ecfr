##### § 423.2062 Applicability of policies not binding on the ALJ and MAC. #####

(a) ALJs and the MAC are not bound by CMS program guidance, such as program memoranda and manual instructions, but will give substantial deference to these policies if they are applicable to a particular case.

(b) If an ALJ or MAC declines to follow a policy in a particular case, the ALJ or MAC decision must explain the reasons why the policy was not followed. An ALJ or MAC decision to disregard a policy applies only to the specific coverage determination being considered and does not have precedential effect.
