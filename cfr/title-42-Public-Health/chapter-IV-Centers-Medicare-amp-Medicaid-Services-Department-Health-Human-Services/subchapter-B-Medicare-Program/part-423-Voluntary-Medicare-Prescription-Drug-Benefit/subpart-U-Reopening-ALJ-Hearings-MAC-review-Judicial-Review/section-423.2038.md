(b) *Enrollee does not wish to appear.* (1) The ALJ may decide a case on the record and not conduct a hearing if -

(i) The enrollee indicates in writing or, for expedited hearings orally or in writing, that he or she does not wish to appear before the ALJ at a hearing, including a hearing conducted by telephone or video teleconferencing, if available. The ALJ hearing office must document all oral requests not to appear at a hearing in writing and maintain the documentation in the case files; or

(ii) The enrollee lives outside the United States and does not inform the ALJ that he or she wants to appear.

(2) When a hearing is not held, the decision of the ALJ must refer to the evidence in the record on which the decision was based.
