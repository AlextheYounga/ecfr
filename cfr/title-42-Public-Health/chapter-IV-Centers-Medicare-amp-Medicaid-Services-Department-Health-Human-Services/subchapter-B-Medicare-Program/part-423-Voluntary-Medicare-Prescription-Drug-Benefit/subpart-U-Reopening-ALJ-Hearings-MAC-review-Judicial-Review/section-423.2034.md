##### § 423.2034 When an ALJ may remand a case. #####

(a) *General.* (1) If an ALJ believes that the written record is missing information that is essential to resolving the issues on appeal and that information can be provided only by CMS, the IRE, and/or the Part D plan sponsor, then the ALJ may either:

(i) Remand the case to the IRE that issued the reconsideration or

(ii) Retain jurisdiction of the case and request that the CMS, the IRE, and/or the Part D plan sponsor forward the missing information to the appropriate hearing office.

(2) If the information is not information that can be provided only by CMS, the IRE, and or the Part D plan sponsor, the ALJ must retain jurisdiction of the case and obtain the information on his or her own, or directly from the enrollee.

(3) “Can be provided only by CMS, the IRE, and/or the Part D plan sponsor” means the information is not publicly available, is not in the possession of the enrollee, and cannot be requested and obtained by the enrollee. Information that is publicly available is information that is available to the general public via the Internet or in a printed publication. It includes, but is not limited to, information available on a CMS, IRE or Part D Plan sponsor website or information in an official CMS or HHS publication.

(b) *ALJ remands a case to an IRE.* (1) Consistent with § 423.2004(b), the ALJ will remand a case to the appropriate IRE if the ALJ determines that an IRE's dismissal of a request for reconsideration was in error.

(2) The ALJ will remand a case to the appropriate Part D IRE if the ALJ determines that the enrollee wishes evidence on his or her change in condition after the coverage determination to be considered in the appeal.
