##### § 423.1980 Reopenings of coverage determinations, redeterminations, reconsiderations, hearings and reviews. #####

(a) *General rules.* (1) A reopening is a remedial action taken to change a binding determination or decision, even though the binding determination or decision may have been correct at the time it was made based on the evidence of record. Consistent with § 423.1978(a), that action may be taken by -

(i) A Part D plan sponsor to revise the coverage determination or redetermination;

(ii) An IRE to revise the reconsideration;

(iii) An ALJ to revise the hearing decision; or

(iv) The MAC to revise the hearing or review decision.

(2) When an enrollee has filed a valid request for an appeal of a coverage determination, redetermination, reconsideration, hearing, or MAC review, no adjudicator has jurisdiction to reopen an issue that is under appeal until all appeal rights for that issue are exhausted. Once the appeal rights for the issue have been exhausted, the Part D plan sponsor, IRE, ALJ, or MAC may reopen as set forth in this section.

(3) Consistent with § 423.1978(b), the filing of a request for reopening does not relieve the Part D plan sponsor of its obligation to make payment or provide benefits as specified in § 423.636 or § 423.638.

(4) Consistent with § 423.1978(d), the Part D plan sponsor's, IRE's, ALJ's, or MAC's decision on whether to reopen is binding and not subject to appeal.

(5) A determination under the Medicare secondary payer provisions of section 1862(b) of the Act that Medicare has an MSP recovery claim for drug claims that were already reimbursed by the Part D plan sponsor is not a reopening.

(b) *Timeframes and requirements for reopening coverage determinations and redeterminations initiated by a Part D plan sponsor.* A Part D plan sponsor may reopen its coverage determination or redetermination on its own motion:

(1) Within 1 year from the date of the coverage determination or redetermination for any reason.

(2) Within 4 years from the date of the coverage determination or redetermination for good cause as defined in § 423.1986.

(3) At any time if there exists reliable evidence as defined in § 405.902 of this chapter that the coverage determination was procured by fraud or similar fault as defined in § 405.902.

(c) *Timeframe and requirements for reopening coverage determinations and redeterminations requested by an enrollee.* (1) An enrollee may request that a Part D plan sponsor reopen its coverage determination or redetermination within 1 year from the date of the coverage determination or redetermination for any reason.
