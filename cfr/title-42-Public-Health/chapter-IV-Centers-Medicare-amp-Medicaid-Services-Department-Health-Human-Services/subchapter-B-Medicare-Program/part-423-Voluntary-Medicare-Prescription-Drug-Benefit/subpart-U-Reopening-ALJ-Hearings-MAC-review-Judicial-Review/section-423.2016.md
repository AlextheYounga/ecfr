##### ยง 423.2016 Timeframes for deciding an Appeal before an ALJ. #####

(a) *Hearings.* (1) When a request for an ALJ hearing is filed after an IRE has issued a written reconsideration, the ALJ must issue a decision, dismissal order, or remand, as appropriate, no later than the end of the 90 calendar day period beginning on the date the request for hearing is received by the entity specified in the IRE's notice of reconsideration, unless the 90 calendar day period has been extended as provided in this subpart.

(2) The adjudication period specified in paragraph (a) of this section begins on the date that a timely filed request for hearing is received by the entity specified in the IRE's reconsideration, or, if it is not timely filed, the date that the ALJ grants any extension to the filing deadline.

(b) *Expedited hearings.* (1) Standard for expedited hearing. The ALJ must provide an expedited hearing decision if the appeal involves an issue specified in ยง 423.566(b), but is not solely a request for payment of Part D drugs already furnished, and the enrollee's prescribing physician or other prescriber indicates, or the ALJ determines that applying the standard timeframe for making a decision may seriously jeopardize the enrollee's life, health or ability to regain maximum function. The ALJ may consider this standard as met if a lower level adjudicator has granted a request for an expedited hearing.

(2) Grant of a request. If the ALJ grants a request for expedited hearing, the ALJ must -

(i) Make the decision to grant an expedited hearing within 5 calendar days of receipt of the request for expedited hearing;

(ii) Give the enrollee prompt oral notice of this decision; and

(iii) Subsequently send to the enrollee at his or her last known address and to the Part D plan sponsor written notice of the decision. This notice may be provided within the written notice of hearing.

(3) Denial of a request. If the ALJ denies a request for expedited hearing, the ALJ must -

(i) Make this decision within 5 calendar days of receipt of the request for expedited hearing;

(ii) Give the enrollee prompt oral notice of the denial that informs the enrollee of the denial and explains that the ALJ will process the enrollee's request using the 90 calendar day timeframe for non-expedited ALJ hearings; and

(iii) Subsequently send to the enrollee at his or her last known address and to the Part D plan sponsor an equivalent written notice of the decision within 3 calendar days after the oral notice.

(4) A decision on a request for expedited hearing may not be appealed.

(5) Timeframe for adjudication. (i) If the ALJ accepts a request for expedited hearing, the ALJ must issue a written decision, dismissal order or remand, as expeditiously as the enrollee's health condition requires, but no later than the end of the 10 calendar day period beginning on the date the request for hearing is received by the entity specified in the IRE's written notice of reconsideration, unless the 10 calendar day period has been extended as provided in this subpart.

(ii) The adjudication period specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section begins on the date that a timely provided request for hearing is received by the entity specified in the IRE's reconsideration, or, if it is not timely provided, the date that the ALJ grants any extension to the filing deadline.
