Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 5124, Jan. 17, 2017.

When a Federal district court remands a case to the Secretary for further consideration, unless the court order specifies otherwise, the MAC, acting on behalf of the Secretary, may make a decision, or it may remand the case to an ALJ with instructions to take action and either issue a decision, take other action, or return the case to the MAC with a recommended decision. If the MAC remands a case, the procedures specified in § 405.1140 will be followed.
