(a)(1) A party to the ALJ hearing may request a MAC review if the party files a written request for a MAC review within 60 calendar days after receipt of the ALJ's decision or dismissal.

(2) For purposes of this section, the date of receipt of the ALJ's decision or dismissal is presumed to be 5 calendar days after the date of the notice of the decision or dismissal, unless there is evidence to the contrary.

(3) The request is considered as filed on the date it is received by the entity specified in the notice of the ALJ's action.

(b) A party requesting a review may ask that the time for filing a request for MAC review be extended if -

(1) The request for an extension of time is in writing;

(2) It is filed with the MAC; and

(3) It explains why the request for review was not filed within the stated time period. If the MAC finds that there is good cause for missing the deadline, the time period will be extended. To determine whether good cause exists, the MAC uses the standards outlined at §§ 405.942(b)(2) and 405.942(b)(3).

(c) A party does not have the right to seek MAC review of an ALJ's remand to a QIC or an ALJ's affirmation of a QIC's dismissal of a request for reconsideration.
