Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 5123, Jan. 17, 2017.

(a) The request for MAC review must be filed with the MAC or appropriate ALJ hearing office. The request for review must be in writing and may be made on a standard form. A written request that is not made on a standard form is accepted if it contains the beneficiary's name; Medicare health insurance claim number; the specific service(s) or item(s) for which the review is requested; the specific date(s) of service; the date of the ALJ's decision or dismissal order, if any; if the party is requesting escalation from the ALJ to the MAC, the hearing office in which the appellant's request for hearing is pending; and the name and signature of the party or the representative of the party; and any other information CMS may decide.

(b) The request for review must identify the parts of the ALJ action with which the party requesting review disagrees and explain why he or she disagrees with the ALJ's decision, dismissal, or other determination being appealed. For example, if the party requesting review believes that the ALJ's action is inconsistent with a statute, regulation, CMS Ruling, or other authority, the request for review should explain why the appellant believes the action is inconsistent with that authority.

(c) The MAC will limit its review of an ALJ's actions to those exceptions raised by the party in the request for review, unless the appellant is an unrepresented beneficiary. For purposes of this section only, we define a representative as anyone who has accepted an appointment as the beneficiary's representative, except a member of the beneficiary's family, a legal guardian, or an individual who routinely acts on behalf of the beneficiary, such as a family member or friend who has a power of attorney.
