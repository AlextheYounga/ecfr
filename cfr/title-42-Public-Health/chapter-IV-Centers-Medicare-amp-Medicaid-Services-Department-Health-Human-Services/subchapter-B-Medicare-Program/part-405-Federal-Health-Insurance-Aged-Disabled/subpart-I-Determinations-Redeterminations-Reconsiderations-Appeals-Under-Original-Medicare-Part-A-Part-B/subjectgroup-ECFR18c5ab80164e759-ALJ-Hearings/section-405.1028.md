##### ยง 405.1028 Prehearing case review of evidence submitted to the ALJ. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 5115, Jan. 17, 2017.

(a) *Examination of any new evidence.* After a hearing is requested but before it is held, the ALJ will examine any new evidence submitted with the request for hearing (or within 10 calendar days of receiving the notice of hearing) as specified in ยง 405.1018, by a provider, supplier, or beneficiary represented by a provider or supplier to determine whether the provider, supplier, or beneficiary represented by a provider or supplier had good cause for submitting the evidence for the first time at the ALJ level.

(b) *Determining if good cause exists.* An ALJ finds good cause, for example, when the new evidence is material to an issue addressed in the QIC's reconsideration and that issue was not identified as a material issue prior to the QIC's reconsideration.

(c) *If good cause does not exist.* If the ALJ determines that there was not good cause for submitting the evidence for the first time at the ALJ level, the ALJ must exclude the evidence from the proceeding and may not consider it in reaching a decision.

(d) *Notification to all parties.* As soon as possible, but no later than the start of the hearing, the ALJ must notify all parties that the evidence is excluded from the hearing.
