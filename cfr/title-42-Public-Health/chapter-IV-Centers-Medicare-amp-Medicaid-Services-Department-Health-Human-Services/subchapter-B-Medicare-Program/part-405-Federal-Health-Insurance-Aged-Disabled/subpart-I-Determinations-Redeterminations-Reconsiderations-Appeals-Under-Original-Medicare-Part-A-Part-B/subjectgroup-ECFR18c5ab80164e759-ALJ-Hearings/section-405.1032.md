##### § 405.1032 Issues before an ALJ. #####

(a) *General rule.* The issues before the ALJ include all the issues brought out in the initial determination, redetermination, or reconsideration that were not decided entirely in a party's favor. (For purposes of this provision, the term “party” does not include a representative of CMS or one of its contractors that may be participating in the hearing.) However, if evidence presented before the hearing causes the ALJ to question a favorable portion of the determination, he or she notifies the parties before the hearing and may consider it an issue at the hearing.

(b) *New issues* - (1) *General.* The ALJ may consider a new issue at the hearing if he or she notifies all of the parties about the new issue any time before the start of the hearing. The new issue may include issues resulting from the participation of CMS at the ALJ level of adjudication and from any evidence and position papers submitted by CMS for the first time to the ALJ. The ALJ or any party may raise a new issue; however, the ALJ may only consider a new issue if its resolution -

(i) Could have a material impact on the claim or claims that are the subject of the request for hearing; and

(ii) Is permissible under the rules governing reopening of determinations and decisions (see § 405.980).

(2) [Reserved]

(c) *Adding claims to a pending appeal.* An ALJ cannot add any claim, including one that is related to an issue that is appropriately before an ALJ, to a pending appeal unless it has been adjudicated at the lower appeals levels and all parties are notified of the new issue(s) before the start of the hearing.
