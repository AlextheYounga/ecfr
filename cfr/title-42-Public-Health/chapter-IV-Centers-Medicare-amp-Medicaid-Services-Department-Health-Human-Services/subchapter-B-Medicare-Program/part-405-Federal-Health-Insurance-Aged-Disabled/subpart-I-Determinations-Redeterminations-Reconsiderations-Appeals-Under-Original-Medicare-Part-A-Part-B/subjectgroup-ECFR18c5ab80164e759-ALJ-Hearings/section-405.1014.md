##### § 405.1014 Request for an ALJ hearing. #####

(a) *Content of the request.* The request for an ALJ hearing must be made in writing. The request must include all of the following -

(1) The name, address, and Medicare health insurance claim number of the beneficiary whose claim is being appealed.

(2) The name and address of the appellant, when the appellant is not the beneficiary.

(3) The name and address of the designated representatives if any.

(4) The document control number assigned to the appeal by the QIC, if any.

(5) The dates of service.

(6) The reasons the appellant disagrees with the QIC's reconsideration or other determination being appealed.

(7) A statement of any additional evidence to be submitted and the date it will be submitted.

(b) *When and where to file.* The request for an ALJ hearing after a QIC reconsideration must be filed -

(1) Within 60 calendar days from the date the party receives notice of the QIC's reconsideration;

(2) With the entity specified in the QIC's reconsideration. The appellant must also send a copy of the request for hearing to the other parties. Failure to do so will toll the ALJ's 90 calendar day adjudication deadline until all parties to the QIC reconsideration receive notice of the requested ALJ hearing. If the request for hearing is timely filed with an entity other than the entity specified in the QIC's reconsideration, the deadline specified in § 405.1016 for deciding the appeal begins on the date the entity specified in the QIC's reconsideration receives the request for hearing. If the request for hearing is filed with an entity, other than the entity specified in the QIC's reconsideration, the ALJ hearing office must notify the appellant of the date of receipt of the request and the commencement of the 90 calendar day adjudication time frame.

(c) *Extension of time to request a hearing.* (1) If the request for hearing is not filed within 60 calendar days of receipt of the QIC's reconsideration, an appellant may request an extension for good cause (See §§ 405.942(b)(2) and 405.942(b)(3)).

(2) Any request for an extension of time must be in writing, give the reasons why the request for a hearing was not filed within the stated time period, and must be filed with the entity specified in the notice of reconsideration.

(3) If the ALJ finds there is good cause for missing the deadline, the time period for filing the hearing request will be extended. To determine whether good cause for late filing exists, the ALJ uses the standards set forth in §§ 405.942(b)(2) and 405.942(b)(3).

(4) If a request for hearing is not timely filed, the adjudication period in § 405.1016 begins the date the ALJ grants the request to extend the filing deadline.
