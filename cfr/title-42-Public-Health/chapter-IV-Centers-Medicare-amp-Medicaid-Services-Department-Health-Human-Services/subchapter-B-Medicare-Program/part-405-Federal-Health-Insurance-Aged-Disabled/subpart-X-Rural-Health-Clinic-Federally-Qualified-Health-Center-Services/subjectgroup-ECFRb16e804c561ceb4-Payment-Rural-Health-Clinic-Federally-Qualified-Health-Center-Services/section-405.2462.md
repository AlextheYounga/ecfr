##### § 405.2462 Payment for RHC and FQHC services. #####

(a) *Payment to provider-based RHCs that are authorized to bill under the reasonable cost system.* A RHC that is authorized to bill under the reasonable cost system is paid in accordance with parts 405 and 413 of this subchapter, as applicable, if the RHC is -

(1) An integral and subordinate part of a hospital, skilled nursing facility or home health agency participating in Medicare (that is, a provider of services); and

(2) Operated with other departments of the provider under common licensure, governance and professional supervision.

(b) *Payment to independent RHCs that are authorized to bill under the reasonable cost system.* (1) RHCs that are authorized to bill under the reasonable cost system are paid on the basis of an all-inclusive rate for each beneficiary visit for covered services. This rate is determined by the MAC, in accordance with this subpart and general instructions issued by CMS.

(2) The amount payable by the MAC for a visit is determined in accordance with paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section.

(c) *Payment to FQHCs that are authorized to bill under the PPS.* A FQHC that is authorized to bill under the PPS is paid a single, per diem rate based on the prospectively set rate for each beneficiary visit for covered services. Except as noted in paragraph (d) of this section, this rate is adjusted for the following:

(1) Geographic differences in cost based on the Geographic Practice Cost Indices (GPCIs) in accordance with section 1848(e) of the Act and 42 CFR 414.2 and 414.26 are used to adjust payment under the physician fee schedule during the same period, limited to only the work and practice expense GPCIs.

(2) Furnishing of care to a beneficiary that is a new patient with respect to the FQHC, including all sites that are part of the FQHC. A new patient is one that has not been treated by the FQHC's organization within the previous 3 years.

(3) Furnishing of care to a beneficiary receiving a comprehensive initial Medicare visit (that is an initial preventive physical examination or an initial annual wellness visit) or a subsequent annual wellness visit.

(d) *Payment to grandfathered tribal FQHCs.* (1) A “grandfathered tribal FQHC” is a FQHC that:

(i) Is operated by a tribe or tribal organization under the Indian Self-Determination Education and Assistance Act (ISDEAA);

(ii) Was billing as if it were provider-based to an IHS hospital on or before April 7, 2000; and

(iii) Is not operating as a provider-based department of an IHS hospital.

(2) A grandfathered tribal FQHC is paid at the Medicare outpatient per visit rate as set annually by the IHS.

(3) The payment rate is not adjusted:

(i) By the FQHC Geographic Adjustment Factor;

(ii) For new patients, annual wellness visits, or initial preventive physical examinations; or

(iii) Annually by the Medicare Economic Index or a FQHC PPS market basket.

(4) The payment rate is adjusted annually by the IHS under the authority of sections 321(a) and 322(b) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 248 and 249(b)), Pub. L. 83-568 (42 U.S.C. 2001(a)), and the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1601 *et seq.*).

(e)(1) Except for preventive services for which Medicare pays 100 percent under § 410.152(l) of this chapter, Medicare pays -

(i) Eighty (80) percent of the lesser of the FQHC's actual charge or the PPS encounter rate for FQHCs authorized to bill under the PPS; or

(ii) Eighty (80) percent of the lesser of a grandfathered tribal FQHC's actual charge, or the outpatient rate for Medicare as set annually by the IHS for grandfathered tribal FQHCs that are authorized to bill at this rate.

(2) No deductible is applicable to FQHC services.

(f) For RHCs visits, payment is made in accordance with one of the following:

(1) If the deductible has been fully met by the beneficiary prior to the RHC visit, Medicare pays 80 percent of the all-inclusive rate.

(2) If the deductible has not been fully met by the beneficiary before the visit, and the amount of the RHC's reasonable customary charge for the services that is applied to the deductible is less than the all-inclusive rate, the amount applied to the deductible is subtracted from the all-inclusive rate and 80 percent of the remainder, if any, is paid to the RHC.

(3) If the deductible has not been fully met by the beneficiary before the visit, and the amount of the RHC's reasonable customary charge for the services that is applied to the deductible is equal to or exceeds the all-inclusive rate, no payment is made to the RHC.

(g) To receive payment, the FQHC or RHC must do all of the following:

(1) Furnish services in accordance with the requirements of subpart X of part 405 of this chapter and subpart A of part 491 of this chapter.

(2) File a request for payment on the form and manner prescribed by CMS.

(3) *HCPCS coding.* FQHCs and RHCs are required to submit HCPCS and other codes as required in reporting services furnished.
