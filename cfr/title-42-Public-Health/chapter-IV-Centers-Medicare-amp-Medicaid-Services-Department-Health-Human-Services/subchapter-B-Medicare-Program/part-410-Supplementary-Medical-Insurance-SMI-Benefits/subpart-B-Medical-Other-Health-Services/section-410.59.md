Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 63188, Nov. 15, 2019.

(a) *Basic rule.* Except as specified in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section, Medicare Part B pays for outpatient occupational therapy services only if they are furnished by an individual meeting the qualifications in part 484 of this chapter for an occupational therapist or an appropriately supervised occupational therapy assistant but only under the following conditions:

(1) They are furnished to a beneficiary while he or she is under the care of a physician who is a doctor of medicine, osteopathy, or podiatric medicine.

(2) They are furnished under a written plan of treatment that meets the requirements of § 410.61.

(3) They are furnished -

(i) By a provider as defined in § 489.2 of this chapter, or by others under arrangements with, and under the supervision of, a provider; or

(ii) By, or under the direct supervision of, an occupational therapist in private practice as described in paragraph (c) of this section; or

(iii) By, or incident to the service of, a physician, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or nurse practitioner when those professionals may perform occupational therapy services within the scope of State law. When an occupational therapy service is provided incident to the service of a physician, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or nurse practitioner, by anyone other than a physician, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or nurse practitioner, the service and the person who furnishes the service must meet the standards and conditions that apply to occupational therapy and occupational therapists, except that a license to practice occupational therapy in the State is not required.

(b) *Conditions for coverage of outpatient therapy services furnished to certain inpatients of a hospital or a CAH or SNF.* Medicare Part B pays for outpatient occupational therapy services furnished to an inpatient of a hospital, CAH, or SNF who requires them but who has exhausted or is otherwise ineligible for benefit days under Medicare Part A.

(c) *Special provisions for services furnished by occupational therapists in private practice* - (1) *Basic qualifications.* In order to qualify under Medicare as a supplier of outpatient occupational therapy services, each individual occupational therapist in private practice must meet the following requirements:

(i) Be legally authorized (if applicable, licensed, certified, or registered) to engage in the private practice of occupational therapy by the State in which he or she practices, and practice only within the scope of his or her license, certification, or registration.

(ii) Engage in the private practice of occupational therapy on a regular basis as an individual, in one of the following practice types: a solo practice, partnership, or group practice; or as an employee of one of these.

(iii) Bill Medicare only for services furnished in his or her private practice office space, or in the patient's home. A therapist's private practice office space refers to the location(s) where the practice is operated, in the State(s) where the therapist (and practice, if applicable) is legally authorized to furnish services, during the hours that the therapist engages in practice at that location. When services are furnished in private practice office space, that space must be owned, leased, or rented by the practice and used for the exclusive purpose of operating the practice. A patient's home does not include any institution that is a hospital, an CAH, or a SNF.

(iv) Treat individuals who are patients of the practice and for whom the practice collects fees for the services furnished.

(2) *Supervision of occupational therapy services.* Occupational therapy services are performed by, or under the direct supervision of, an occupational therapist in private practice. All services not performed personally by the therapist must be performed by employees of the practice, directly supervised by the therapist, and included in the fee for the therapist's services.

(d) *Excluded services.* No service is included as an outpatient occupational therapy service if it would not be included as an inpatient hospital service if furnished to a hospital or CAH inpatient.

(e) *Annual limitation on incurred expenses.* (1) Amount of limitation. (i) In 1999, 2000, and 2001, no more than $1,500 of allowable charges incurred in a calendar year for outpatient occupational therapy services are recognized incurred expenses.

(ii) In 2002 and thereafter, the limitation is determined by increasing the limitation in effect in the previous calendar year by the increase in the Medicare Economic Index for the current year.

(iii) The limitation is not applied for services furnished from December 8, 2003 through December 31, 2005.

(iv) Outpatient occupational therapy services furnished by a CAH directly or under arrangements must be counted towards the annual limitation on incurred expenses as if such services were paid under section 1834(k)(1)(b) of the Act.

(2) For purposes of applying the limitation, outpatient occupational therapy includes:

(i) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section, outpatient occupational therapy services furnished under this section;

(ii) Outpatient occupational therapy services furnished by a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility;

(iii) Outpatient occupational therapy services furnished by a physician or incident to a physician's service;

(iv) Outpatient occupational therapy services furnished by a nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician assistant or incident to their services; and

(v) Outpatient occupational therapy services furnished by a CAH directly or under arrangements.

(3) For purposes of applying the limitation, outpatient occupational therapy services excludes services furnished by a hospital directly or under arrangements.
