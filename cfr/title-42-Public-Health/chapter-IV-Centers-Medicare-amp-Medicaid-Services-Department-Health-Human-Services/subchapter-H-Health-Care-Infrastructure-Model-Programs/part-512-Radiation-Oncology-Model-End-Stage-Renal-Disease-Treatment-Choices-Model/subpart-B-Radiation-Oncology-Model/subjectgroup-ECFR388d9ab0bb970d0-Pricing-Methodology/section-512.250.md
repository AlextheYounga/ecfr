(1) CMS excludes claims from RT suppliers and RT providers in Maryland and Vermont and all inpatient and ASC claims from the construction of episodes and;

(2) CMS excludes the following:

(i) episodes with any RT services furnished by a CAH,

(ii) episodes that are not attributed to an RT provider or RT supplier, and

(iii) episodes in which either the PC or TC is attributed to an RT provider or RT supplier with a U.S. Territory service location.
