(a) *RO participants.* Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, any RO participant that furnishes included RT services in a 5-digit ZIP Code linked to a CBSA selected for participation to an RO beneficiary for an RO episode that begins on or after January 1, 2021, and ends on or before December 31, 2025, must participate in the RO Model.

(b) *Participant exclusions.* A PGP, freestanding radiation therapy center, or HOPD is excluded from participation in the RO Model if it:

(1) Furnishes RT services only in Maryland;

(2) Furnishes RT services only in Vermont;

(3) Furnishes RT services only in U.S. Territories;

(4) Is classified as an ambulatory surgery center (ASC), critical access hospital (CAH), or Prospective Payment System (PPS)-exempt cancer hospital; or

(5) Participates in or is identified by CMS as eligible to participate in the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model.

(c) *Low Volume Opt-Out.* A PGP, freestanding radiation therapy center, or HOPD, which would otherwise be required to participate in the RO Model may choose to opt-out of the RO Model for a given PY if it has fewer than 20 episodes of RT services across all CBSAs selected for participation in the most recent year with claims data available prior to the applicable PY. At least 30 days prior to the start of each PY, CMS notifies RO participants eligible for the low volume opt-out for the upcoming PY. The RO participant must attest to its intention of opting out of the RO Model prior to the start of the upcoming PY.

(d) *Selected CBSAs.* CMS randomly selects CBSAs to identify RT providers and RT suppliers to participate in the RO Model through a stratified sample design, allowing for participant and comparison groups to contain approximately 30 percent of all episodes in eligible geographic areas (CBSAs).
