Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 63994, Nov. 16, 2021.

(a) *RO participants.* Unless otherwise specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, any RO participant that furnishes included RT services in a 5-digit ZIP Code linked to a CBSA selected for participation to an RO beneficiary for an RO episode that begins on or after July 1, 2021, and ends on or before December 31, 2025, must participate in the RO Model.

(b) *Participant exclusions.* A PGP, freestanding radiation therapy center, or HOPD is excluded from participation in the RO Model if it:

(1) Furnishes RT services only in Maryland;

(2) Furnishes RT services only in Vermont;

(3) Furnishes RT services only in U.S. Territories;

(4) Is classified as an ambulatory surgery center (ASC), critical access hospital (CAH), or Prospective Payment System (PPS)-exempt cancer hospital; or

(5) Participates in or is identified by CMS as eligible to participate in the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model.

(c) *Low volume opt-out.* A PGP, freestanding radiation therapy center, or HOPD, which would otherwise be required to participate in the RO Model may choose to opt-out of the RO Model for a given PY if it has fewer than 20 episodes of RT services across all CBSAs selected for participation in the most recent year with claims data available prior to the applicable PY. At least 30 days prior to the start of each PY, CMS notifies RO participants eligible for the low volume opt-out for the upcoming PY. The RO participant must attest to its intention of opting out of the RO Model prior to the start of the upcoming PY. Low volume opt-out eligibility is determined as follows:

(1) *PY1.* Episodes from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 determine eligibility for the low volume opt-out for PY1.

(2) *PY2.* Episodes from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 determine eligibility for the low volume opt-out for PY2.

(3) *PY3.* Episodes from January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2021 and RO episodes from July 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021 determine eligibility for the low volume opt-out for PY3.

(4) *PY4.* RO episodes from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2022 determine low volume opt-out eligibility for PY4.

(5) *PY5.* RO episodes from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2023 determine low volume opt-out eligibility for PY5.

(d) *Selected CBSAs.* CMS randomly selects CBSAs to identify RT providers and RT suppliers to participate in the RO Model through a stratified sample design, allowing for participant and comparison groups to contain approximately 30 percent of all episodes in eligible geographic areas (CBSAs).
