(c) *List certification.* (1) Within 30 days of receipt of the individual practitioner list, and at such other times as specified by CMS, an individual with the authority to legally bind the RO participant must certify the accuracy, completeness, and truthfulness of the individual practitioner list to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and belief.

(2) All Medicare-enrolled individual practitioners that have reassigned their right to receive Medicare payment for provision of RT services to the TIN of the RO participant must be included on the RO participant's individual practitioner list and each individual practitioner must agree to comply with the requirements of the RO Model before the RO participant certifies the individual practitioner list.
