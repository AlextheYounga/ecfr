(a) *General.* For each MY, CMS separately assesses the home dialysis rate and the transplant rate for each ETC Participant based on the population of ESRD Beneficiaries and, if applicable, Pre-emptive LDT Beneficiaries attributed to the ETC Participant under ยง 512.360. Information used to calculate the home dialysis rate and the transplant rate includes Medicare claims data, Medicare administrative data, and data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.

(b) *Home dialysis rate.* CMS calculates the home dialysis rate for ESRD facilities and Managing Clinicians as follows.

(1) *Home dialysis rate for ESRD facilities.* (i) The denominator is the total dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY. Dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the denominator are composed of those months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home or in an ESRD facility, such that one beneficiary year is composed of 12 beneficiary months. Months during which attributed ESRD Beneficiaries received maintenance dialysis are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X.

(ii) The numerator is the total number of home dialysis treatment beneficiary years plus one half the total number of self dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY.

(A) Home dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the numerator are composed of those months during which attributed ESRD Beneficiaries received maintenance dialysis at home, such that one beneficiary year is comprised of 12 beneficiary months. Months in which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X and condition codes 74 or 76.

(B) Self dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the numerator are composed of those months during which attributed ESRD Beneficiaries received self dialysis in center, such that one beneficiary year is comprised of 12 beneficiary months. Months in which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received self dialysis are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X and condition code 72.

(iii) Information used to calculate the ESRD facility home dialysis rate includes Medicare claims data and Medicare administrative data.

(iv) The ESRD facility home dialysis rate is aggregated, as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(2) *Home dialysis rate for Managing Clinicians.* (i) The denominator is the total dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY. Dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the denominator are composed of those months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home or in an ESRD facility, such that one beneficiary year is comprised of 12 beneficiary months. Months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis are identified by claims with CPT codes 90957, 90958, 90959, 90960, 90961, 90962, 90965, or 90966.

(ii) The numerator is the total number of home dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY plus one half the total number of self dialysis treatment beneficiary years.

(A) Home dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the numerator are composed of those months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home, such that one beneficiary year is comprised of 12 beneficiary months. Months in which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home are identified by claims with CPT codes 90965 or 90966.

(B) Self-dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the numerator are composed of those months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received self dialysis in center, such that one beneficiary year is comprised of 12 beneficiary months. Months in which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received self dialysis are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X and condition code 72.

(iii) Information used to calculate the Managing Clinician home dialysis rate includes Medicare claims data and Medicare administrative data.

(iv) The Managing Clinician home dialysis rate is aggregated, as described in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

(c) *Transplant rate.* CMS calculates the transplant rate for ETC Participants as follows.

(1) *Transplant rate for ESRD facilities.* The transplant rate for ESRD facilities is the sum of the transplant waitlist rate for ESRD facilities, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and the living donor transplant rate for ESRD facilities, as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

(i) *Transplant waitlist rate for ESRD facilities.* (A) The denominator is the total dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY. Dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the denominator are composed of those months during which an attributed ESRD beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home or in an ESRD facility, such that one beneficiary year is comprised of 12 beneficiary months. Months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X, excluding claims for beneficiaries who were 75 years of age or older at any point during the month.

(B) The numerator is the total number of attributed beneficiary years for which attributed ESRD Beneficiaries were on the kidney transplant waitlist. Months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary was on the kidney transplant waitlist are identified using data from the SRTR database.

(ii) *Living donor transplant rate for ESRD facilities.* (A) The denominator is the total dialysis treatment beneficiary years for attributed ESRD Beneficiaries during the MY. Dialysis treatment beneficiary years included in the denominator are composed of those months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis at home or in an ESRD facility, such that one beneficiary year is comprised of 12 beneficiary months. Months during which an attributed ESRD Beneficiary received maintenance dialysis are identified by claims with Type of Bill 072X, excluding claims for beneficiaries who were 75 years of age or older at any point during the month.

(B) The numerator is the total number of attributed beneficiary years for LDT Beneficiaries during the MY. Beneficiary years for LDT Beneficiaries included in the numerator are composed of those months between the beginning of the MY up to and including the month of the transplant for LDT Beneficiaries attributed to an ESRD facility during the month of the transplant. LDT Beneficiaries are identified using information about living donor transplants from the SRTR Database and Medicare claims data.

(iii) The ESRD facility transplant waitlist rate is risk adjusted, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. The ESRD facility transplant rate is aggregated, as described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(2) *Transplant rate for Managing Clinicians.* The transplant rate for Managing Clinicians is the sum of the transplant waitlist rate for Managing Clinicians, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, and the living donor transplant rate for Managing Clinicians, as described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
