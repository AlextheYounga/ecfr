##### § 512.315 Composite quality scores for determining reconciliation payment eligibility and effective and applicable discount factors. #####

(a) *General.* An EPM participant's eligibility for a reconciliation payment under § 512.305, and the determination of effective discount factors and applicable discount factors for reconciliation and repayment, respectively, under paragraphs (b)(5), (c)(5), and (d)(5) of this section, for a performance year depend on the EPM participant's EPM composite quality score (including any quality performance points and quality improvement points earned) for that performance year.

(b) *AMI model* - (1) *AMI model composite quality score.* CMS calculates an AMI model composite quality score for each AMI model participant for each performance year, which equals the sum of the following:
