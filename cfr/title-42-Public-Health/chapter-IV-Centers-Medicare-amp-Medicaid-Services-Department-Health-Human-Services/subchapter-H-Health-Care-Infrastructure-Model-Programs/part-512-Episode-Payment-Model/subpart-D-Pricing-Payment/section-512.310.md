##### ยง 512.310 Appeals process. #####

(a) *Notice of calculation error (first level of appeal).* Subject to the limitations on review in subpart D of this part, if an EPM participant wishes to dispute calculations involving a matter related to payment, a CR incentive payment, reconciliation amounts, repayment amounts, the use of quality measure results in determining the composite quality score, or the application of the composite quality score during reconciliation, the EPM participant is required to provide written notice of the calculation error, in a form and manner specified by CMS.

(1) Unless the EPM participant provides such notice, CMS deems final the reconciliation report and CR incentive payment report 45 calendar days after the reconciliation report or CR incentive payment report is issued and proceeds with the payment or repayment processes as applicable.

(2) If CMS receives a notice of a calculation error within 45 calendar days of the issuance of the reconciliation report or CR incentive payment report, CMS responds in writing within 30 calendar days to either confirm that there was an error in the calculation or verify that the calculation is correct, although CMS reserves the right to an extension upon written notice to the EPM participant.

(3) Only EPM participants may use the notice of calculation error process described in this part.

(b) *Dispute resolution process (second level of appeal).* (1) If the EPM participant is dissatisfied with CMS' response to the notice of a calculation error, the EPM participant may request a reconsideration review in a form and manner as specified by CMS.

(2) The reconsideration request must provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the dispute and include supporting documentation for the EPM participant's assertion that CMS or its representatives did not accurately calculate the NPRA, the reconciliation payment, the CR incentive payment, or the repayment amount in accordance with subpart D of this part.

(3) If CMS does not receive a request for reconsideration from the EPM participant within 10 calendar days of the issue date of CMS' response to the EPM participant's notice of calculation error, then CMS' response to the calculation error is deemed final and CMS proceeds with the applicable processes, as described in subpart D of this part.

(4) The CMS reconsideration official notifies the EPM participant in writing within 15 calendar days of receiving the EPM participant's review request of the following:

(i) The date, time, and location of the review.

(ii) The issues in dispute.

(iii) The review procedures.

(c) *Exception to the notice of calculation error process.* If the EPM participant contests a matter that does not involve an issue contained in, or a calculation which contributes to, a reconciliation report or CR incentive payment report a notice of calculation error is not required. In these instances, if CMS does not receive a request for reconsideration from the EPM participant within 10 calendar days of the notice of the initial determination, the initial determination is deemed final and CMS proceeds with the action indicated in the initial determination. This does not apply to the limitations on review in paragraph (e) of this section.
