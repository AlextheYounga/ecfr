##### ยง 512.105 Geographic areas. #####

(a) The SHFFT model must be implemented in the same geographic areas as the CJR model as described under ยง 510.105 of the chapter.

(b) The geographic areas for inclusion in the CABG and AMI models will be obtained using a random sampling of certain MSAs in the United States. All counties within each of the selected MSAs are selected for inclusion in the AMI and CABG models. CMS excludes MSAs that met the following criteria between January 1, 2014 and December 31, 2014 from the possibility of being selected geographic areas. MSAs are excluded if they -

(1) Had fewer than 75 AMI episodes;

(2) Had fewer than 75 AMI episodes that were not attributable to BPCI Model 2 or 4, AMI, CABG or PCI episodes;

(3) Had more than 50 percent of otherwise qualifying (BPCI or non BPCI) episodes attributable to a BPCI Model 2 or 4 AMI, CABG or PCI episodes; or

(4) Are in Maryland, Vermont, or another state where CMS is implementing a state-wide all-payer model. In such situations all MSAs in the state may be excluded even if hospitals are otherwise being paid in accordance with the IPPS and would otherwise qualify as an eligible EPM participant.

(c) In all geographic areas where the AMI, CABG, or SHFFT models are being implemented, the accountable financial entity must be an acute care IPPS hospital.
