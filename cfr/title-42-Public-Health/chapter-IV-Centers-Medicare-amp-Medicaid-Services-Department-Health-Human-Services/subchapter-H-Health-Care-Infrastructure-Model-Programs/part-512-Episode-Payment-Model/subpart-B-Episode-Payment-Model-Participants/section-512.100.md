##### ยง 512.100 EPM episodes being tested. #####

(a) *Initiation of an episode.* An episode is initiated when an EPM participant admits a Medicare beneficiary described in ยง 512.230 for an anchor hospitalization.

(b) *Hospital exclusions.* (1) A hospital is excluded from participating in EPMs for EPM anchor MS-DRGs that are included in BPCI episodes in which the hospital currently participates.

(2) These exclusions cease to apply as of the date that the hospital no longer meets the conditions specified in this paragraph (b) or September 30, 2018, whichever date is sooner.

(c) *Types of EPM episodes.* An EPM episode is initiated by a beneficiary's admission to an EPM participant for an anchor hospitalization that is paid under an EPM anchor MS-DRG and, in the case of the AMI model, with an AMI ICD-10-CM diagnosis code if the admission is under a PCI MS-DRG. The EPM anchor MS-DRGs and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for the EPM episodes are as follows:

(1) *Acute myocardial infarction (AMI).* (i) Discharge under an AMI MS-DRG (MS-DRGs 280 to 282); or

(ii) Discharge under a PCI MS-DRG (MS-DRGs 246 to 251) with an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code of AMI on the claim for the anchor hospitalization in the principal or secondary diagnosis code position.

(2) *Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).* Discharge under a CABG MS-DRG (MS-DRGs 231 to 236).

(3) *Surgical hip/femur fracture treatment (SHFFT).* Discharge under a SHFFT MS-DRG (MS-DRGs 480 to 482).

(d) *Identifying AMI historical episodes and EPM episodes with AMI ICD-CM diagnosis codes.* CMS develops a list of AMI ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes that identify the initiation of historical episodes or initiate AMI model episodes when reported in the principal or secondary diagnosis code position on the inpatient hospital claim for a historical hospitalization or the anchor hospitalization discharged under PCI MS-DRGs (MS-DRGs 246 to 251). The list of ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes representing AMI is posted on the CMS Web site.

(1) On an annual basis, or more frequently as needed, CMS updates the list of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes representing AMI to reflect coding changes or other issues brought to CMS' attention.

(2) CMS applies the following standard when revising the list of ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes representing AMI: The ICD-10-CM diagnosis code is sufficiently specific that it represents an AMI.

(3) CMS posts the following to the CMS Web site:

(i) Potential AMI ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for public comment; and

(ii) A final AMI ICD-10-CM diagnosis code list after consideration of public comment.

(4) CMS excludes AMI historical episodes with PCI MS-DRGs and inpatient claims that contain intracardiac ICD-9-CM procedure codes. CMS excludes historical AMI model episodes discharged under PCI MS-DRGs with an AMI ICD-9-CM diagnosis code in the principal or secondary diagnosis code position on the inpatient hospital claim from the AMI historical episodes that set episode benchmark prices if there is an intracardiac ICD-9-CM procedure code in any procedure code field on the inpatient hospital claim. The intracardiac ICD-9-CM procedure codes are as follows:

(i) 35.52 (Repair of atrial septal defect with prosthesis, closed technique).

(ii) 35.96 (Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty).

(iii) 35.97 (Percutaneous mitral valve repair with implant).

(iv) 37.26 (Catheter based invasive electrophysiologic testing).

(v) 37.27 (Cardiac mapping).

(vi) 37.34 (Excision or destruction of other lesion or tissue of heart, endovascular approach).

(vii) 37.36 (Excision, destruction, or exclusion of left atrial appendage).

(viii) 37.90 (Insertion of left atrial appendage device).
