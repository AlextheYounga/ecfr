##### § 512.500 Sharing arrangements under the EPM. #####

(a) *General.* (1) An EPM participant may enter into a sharing arrangement with an EPM collaborator to make a gainsharing payment, or to receive an alignment payment, or both. An EPM participant must not make a gainsharing payment or receive an alignment payment except in accordance with a sharing arrangement.

(2) A sharing arrangement must comply with the provisions of this section and all other applicable laws and regulations, including the applicable fraud and abuse laws and all applicable payment and coverage requirements.

(3) The EPM participant must develop, maintain, and use a set of written policies for selecting individuals and entities to be EPM collaborators. These policies must contain criteria related to, and inclusive of, the quality of care delivered by the potential EPM collaborator. The selection criteria cannot be based directly or indirectly on the volume or value of past or anticipated referrals or business otherwise generated by, between or among the EPM participant, any EPM collaborator, any collaboration agent, any downstream collaboration agent, or any individual or entity affiliated with an EPM participant, EPM collaborator, collaboration agent, or downstream collaboration agent. A selection criterion that considers whether a potential EPM collaborator has performed a reasonable minimum number of services that would qualify as EPM activities will be deemed not to violate the volume or value standard if the purpose of the criterion is to ensure the quality of care furnished to EPM beneficiaries.

(4) If an EPM participant enters into a sharing arrangement, its compliance program must include oversight of sharing arrangements and compliance with the applicable requirements of the EPM.

(b) *Requirements.* (1) A sharing arrangement must be in writing and signed by the parties, and entered into before care is furnished to EPM beneficiaries under the sharing arrangement.

(2) Participation in a sharing arrangement must be voluntary and without penalty for nonparticipation.

(3) The sharing arrangement must require the EPM collaborator and its employees, contractors (including collaboration agents), and subcontractors (including downstream collaboration agents) to comply with all of the following:

(i) The applicable provisions of this part (including requirements regarding beneficiary notifications, access to records, record retention, and participation in any evaluation, monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities performed by CMS or its designees).

(ii) All applicable Medicare provider enrollment requirements at § 424.500 of this chapter, including having a valid and active TIN or NPI, during the term of the sharing arrangement.

(iii) All other applicable laws and regulations.

(4) The sharing arrangement must require the EPM collaborator to have or be covered by a compliance program that includes oversight of the sharing arrangement and compliance with the requirements of the EPM that apply to its role as an EPM collaborator, including any distribution arrangements.

(5) The sharing arrangement must not pose a risk to beneficiary access, beneficiary freedom of choice, or quality of care.

(6) The board or other governing body of the EPM participant must have responsibility for overseeing the EPM participant's participation in the EPM, its arrangements with EPM collaborators, its payment of gainsharing payments, its receipt of alignment payments, and its use of beneficiary incentives in the EPM.

(7) The written agreement memorializing a sharing arrangement must specify the following:

(i) The purpose and scope of the sharing arrangement;

(ii) The identities and obligations of the parties, including specified EPM activities and other services to be performed by the parties under the sharing arrangement;

(iii) The date of the sharing arrangement.

(iv) The financial or economic terms for payment, including the following:

(A) Eligibility criteria for a gainsharing payment.

(B) Eligibility criteria for an alignment payment.

(E) Methodology and accounting formula for determining the amount of an alignment payment.

(8) The sharing arrangement must not -

(i) Induce the EPM participant, EPM collaborator, or any employees, contractors, or subcontractors of the EPM participant or EPM collaborator to reduce or limit medically necessary services to any Medicare beneficiary; or

(ii) Restrict the ability of an EPM collaborator to make decisions in the best interests of its patients, including the selection of devices, supplies, and treatments.

(c) *Gainsharing payment, alignment payment, and internal cost savings conditions and restrictions.* (1) Gainsharing payments, if any, must -

(i) Be derived solely from reconciliation payments, or internal cost savings, or both;

(2)(i) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment, an EPM collaborator must meet quality of care criteria for the performance year for which the EPM participant accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment. The quality of care criteria must be established by the EPM participant and directly related to EPM episodes.

(ii) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment, or to be required to make an alignment payment, an EPM collaborator other than an ACO, PGP, NPPGP, or TGP must have directly furnished a billable item or service to an EPM beneficiary during an EPM episode that occurred in the same performance year for which the EPM participant accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment or was assessed a repayment amount.

(iv) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment, or to be required to make an alignment payment, an EPM collaborator that is an ACO must meet the following criteria:

(A) The ACO must have had an ACO provider/supplier that directly furnished, or an ACO participant that billed for, an item or service that was rendered to an EPM beneficiary during an EPM episode that occurred during the same performance year for which the EPM participant accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment or was assessed a repayment amount; and

(B) The ACO must have contributed to EPM activities and been clinically involved in the care of EPM beneficiaries during the same performance year for which the EPM participant accrued the internal cost savings or earned the reconciliation payment that comprises the gainsharing payment or was assessed a repayment amount.
