##### ยง 512.610 Waiver of SNF 3-day rule. #####

(a) *Applicability of the SNF 3-day rule waiver.* CMS determines that the SNF 3-day rule is -

(1) Waived for the AMI model;

(2) Not waived for the CABG model; and

(3) Not waived for the SHFFT model.

(b) *Waiver of the SNF 3-day rule.* For episodes being tested in those EPMs where the SNF 3-day rule is waived under paragraph (a) of this section, CMS waives the SNF 3-day rule for coverage of a SNF stay for a beneficiary who is an EPM beneficiary on the date of discharge from the anchor hospitalization on or after October 4, 2018, but only if the SNF is identified on the applicable calendar quarter list of qualified SNFs at the time of EPM beneficiary admission to the SNF.

(1) CMS determines the qualified SNFs for each calendar quarter based on a review of the most recent rolling 12 months of overall star ratings on the Five-Star Quality Rating System for SNFs on the Nursing Home Compare Web site. Qualified SNFs are rated an overall of 3 stars or better for at least 7 of the 12 months.

(2) CMS posts to the CMS Web site the list of qualified SNFs in advance of the calendar quarter and the waiver only applies for a beneficiary who has been discharged from an anchor hospitalization if the SNF is included on the applicable calendar quarter list for the date of the beneficiary's admission to the SNF.

(c) *Financial liability for uncovered SNF services.* CMS will determine the financial liability for uncovered SNF services if, subsequent to an EPM hospital applying the SNF 3-day rule waiver under this section, an EPM hospital incorrectly applies the SNF 3-day rule waiver.

(1) If the EPM hospital discharges a beneficiary to a SNF that is not a qualified SNF under paragraph (b) of this section and provides the beneficiary with a discharge planning notice, as described at ยง 512.450(b)(3), to the beneficiary at the time of discharge to a SNF then the SNF coverage requirements apply and the beneficiary may be financially liable for uncovered SNF services.

(2) The EPM hospital will be financially liable for the SNF stay and the SNF must not bill the beneficiary for the costs of the uncovered SNF services furnished during the SNF stay if, subsequent to an EPM hospital applying the SNF 3-day rule waiver under this section, CMS determines the EPM hospital discharges a beneficiary -

(i) To a SNF that is not a qualified SNF under paragraph (b) of this section and the EPM hospital does not provide the beneficiary with a discharge planning notice, as described at ยง 512.450(b)(3)

(ii) That is in an EPM where the SNF 3-day rule waiver is not applicable under paragraph (a) of this section; or

(iii) Prior to October 4, 2018, where the SNF 3-day rule waiver is not applicable under paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) *Other requirements.* All other Medicare rules for coverage and payment of Part A-covered SNF services continue to apply.
