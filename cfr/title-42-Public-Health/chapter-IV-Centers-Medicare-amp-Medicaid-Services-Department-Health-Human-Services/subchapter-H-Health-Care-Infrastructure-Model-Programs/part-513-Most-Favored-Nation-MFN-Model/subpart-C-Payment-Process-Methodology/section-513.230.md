(ii) The MFN participant's excess reduction amount per beneficiary (as determined in paragraph (d)(6) of this section), is greater than zero.

(d) *Excess reduction amount per beneficiary.* CMS calculates the MFN participant's excess reduction amount per beneficiary using available final action claims data where Medicare was the primary payer that is estimated to be more than 90 percent complete in accordance with the following steps:

(1) CMS calculates, separately for dates of service within the performance year and prior year, the MFN participant's total allowed charges for separately payable Medicare Part B drugs, and the total number of beneficiaries that had at least one claim for a service furnished by the MFN participant with a Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B allowed charge greater than $0.

(2) CMS divides the MFN participant's total allowed charges for separately payable Medicare Part B drugs for dates of service within the performance year by the total number of beneficiaries that had at least one claim for a service furnished by the MFN participant with a Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B allowed charge greater than $0 with a service date within the performance year, to calculate the MFN participant's average per beneficiary total allowed charges for separately payable Medicare Part B drugs for the performance year.

(3) CMS divides the MFN participant's total allowed charges for separately payable Medicare Part B drugs for dates of service within the prior year by the total number of beneficiaries that had at least one claim for a service furnished by the MFN participant with a Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B allowed charge greater than $0 with a service date within the prior year, to calculate the MFN participant's average per beneficiary total allowed charges for separately payable Medicare Part B drugs for the prior year.

(4) CMS subtracts the MFN participant's average per beneficiary total allowed charges for separately payable Medicare Part B drugs for the performance year (as calculated in paragraph (d)(2) of this section) from the MFN participant's average per beneficiary total allowed charges for separately payable Medicare Part B drugs for the prior year (as calculated in paragraph (d)(3) of this section).

(5) CMS calculates 25 percent of the MFN participant's total allowed charges for all Medicare Part A and Part B claims with dates of service within the prior year and divides that amount by the total number of beneficiaries that had at least one claim for a service furnished by the MFN participant with a Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B allowed charge greater than $0 with a service date within the prior year, to calculate 25 percent of the MFN participant's average per beneficiary total allowed charges for all Medicare Part A and Part B claims with dates of service within the prior year.

(6) CMS subtracts 25 percent of the MFN participant's average per beneficiary total allowed charges for all Medicare Part A and Part B claims with dates of service within the prior year (as calculated in paragraph (d)(5) of this section) from the difference calculated in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, to calculate the MFN participant's excess reduction amount per beneficiary.

(e) *Reconciliation payment.* (1) If CMS in its sole discretion grants a financial hardship exemption to an MFN participant for a performance year, CMS provides such MFN participant a reconciliation payment for the performance year that equals the amount calculated by multiplying the excess reduction amount per beneficiary specified in paragraph (d)(6) of this section by the total number of beneficiaries that had at least one claim for a service furnished by the MFN participant with a Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B allowed charge greater than $0 with a service date within the performance year.

(2) The amount of a reconciliation payment provided in accordance with this section is -

(i) Not subject to appeal;

(ii) Not subject to beneficiary cost-sharing, including any deductible or coinsurance; and

(iii) Made by CMS (or a CMS contractor) as soon as practical.
