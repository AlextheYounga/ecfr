##### § 513.410 Beneficiary protections. #####

(a) *Beneficiary choice.*

(1) MFN participants must not restrict beneficiaries' ability to choose to receive care from any Medicare participating provider or supplier or any provider or supplier who has opted out of Medicare.

(2) The MFN participant must not commit any act or omission, nor adopt any policy that inhibits a beneficiary from exercising his or her freedom to choose to receive care from any Medicare participating provider or supplier or any provider or supplier who has opted out of Medicare. Notwithstanding the foregoing, MFN participants may communicate to beneficiaries the benefits of receiving care from an MFN participant, if otherwise consistent with the requirements of this part and applicable law.

(b) *Appeals.* An MFN beneficiary and his or her assignees retain their right to appeal claims in accordance with part 405 subpart I of this chapter.

(c) *Availability of services.* MFN participants must not take any action to select or avoid treating beneficiaries based on their diagnoses, care needs, income levels or other factors that would render the beneficiary an “at-risk beneficiary” as defined at § 425.20 of this chapter.
