##### ยง 513.130 MFN Model drugs, updates, categories and excluded drugs. #####

(a) *MFN Model drugs.* CMS creates and periodically updates the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List as described in this section. The MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List designates the MFN Model drugs, which are subject to the MFN Model payments specified in subpart C of this part.

(1) *Initial MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List.* For the beginning of performance year 1, CMS identifies the top 50 drugs by HCPCS code with the highest aggregate 2019 Medicare Part B total allowed charges after making the exclusions specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, and adds the remaining HCPCS codes, after updating such HCPCS codes for any applicable changes, to the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List. Final action claims with dates of service within calendar year 2019 and allowed charges greater than $0 are used to determine aggregate 2019 Medicare Part B total allowed charges.

(2) *Annual Update of the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List.* For the start of each subsequent performance year, using Medicare Part B total allowed charge from the next subsequent calendar year, CMS identifies the top 50 drugs by HCPCS code with the highest aggregate Medicare Part B total allowed charges, after making the exclusions specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, for the most recent full calendar year, and adds any remaining HCPCS codes not already on the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List to the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List, after updating such HCPCS codes for any applicable changes, effective on the first day of the performance year.

(3) *Removal.* No more frequently than quarterly, CMS removes HCPCS codes from the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List when CMS becomes aware that all of the National Drug Codes assigned to the HCPCS code have been permanently withdrawn from the U.S. market and the drug has been permanently withdrawn from the U.S. market, the specific HCPCS code included on the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List is terminated with no replacement code available or planned, or an exclusion in paragraph (b)(1) of this section applies.

(4) *Maintenance.* No more frequently than quarterly, CMS revises HCPCS codes on the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List as necessary to reflect quarterly HCPCS code updates that are applicable to the HCPCS codes on the MFN Model Drug HCPCS Codes List, including adding replacement codes for HCPCS codes that were terminated.
