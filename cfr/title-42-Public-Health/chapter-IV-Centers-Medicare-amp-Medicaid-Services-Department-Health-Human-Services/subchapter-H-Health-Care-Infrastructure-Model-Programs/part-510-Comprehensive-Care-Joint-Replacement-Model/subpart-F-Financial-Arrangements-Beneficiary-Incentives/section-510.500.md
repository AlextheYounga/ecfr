(a) *General.* (1) A participant hospital may elect to enter into sharing arrangements.

(2) A participant hospital must not make a gainsharing payment or receive an alignment payment except in accordance with a sharing arrangement. Any gainsharing payments or alignment payments made in accordance with a sharing arrangement must be made only from the participant hospital to the CJR collaborator with whom the participant hospital has signed a collaborator agreement containing a sharing arrangement.

(3) CMS may review any sharing arrangement for compliance with the requirements of this part and to ensure that it does not pose a risk to beneficiary access, beneficiary freedom of choice, or quality of care.

(4) The participant hospital has ultimate responsibility for fully complying with all provisions of the CJR model.

(5) If a participant hospital enters into a sharing arrangement, it must update its compliance program to include oversight of sharing arrangements and compliance with the requirements of the CJR model.

(6) The board or other governing body of the participant hospital must have responsibility for overseeing the participant hospital's participation in the CJR model, its arrangements with CJR collaborators, its payment of gainsharing payments and receipt of alignment payments, and its use of beneficiary incentives in the CJR model.

(7) Participant hospitals must develop and maintain a written set of policies for selecting providers and suppliers for sharing gains and risk as CJR collaborators. This set of policies must contain criteria for selection of CJR collaborators related to, and inclusive of, the quality of care to be delivered by the CJR collaborator to beneficiaries during a CJR episode. The selection criteria cannot be based directly or indirectly on the volume or value of referrals or business otherwise generated by, between or among the participant hospital, CJR collaborators, and any individual or entity affiliated with a participant hospital or CJR collaborator. All collaborator agreements must require the CJR collaborator to have met, or agree to meet, the quality criteria for selection.

(b) *Sharing arrangement requirements.* Each sharing arrangement must comply with the following criteria:

(1) The sharing arrangement must be set forth in a collaborator agreement that complies with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) The sharing arrangement must comply with all relevant laws and regulations, including the applicable fraud and abuse laws and all applicable payment and coverage requirements.

(3) An individual or entity's participation in a sharing arrangement must be voluntary and without penalty for nonparticipation.

(4) The parties must enter into a sharing arrangement before care is furnished to CJR beneficiaries under the terms of the sharing arrangement.

(5)(i) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment, a CJR collaborator must meet quality criteria for the calendar year for which the gainsharing payment is determined by the participant hospital. The quality criteria must be established by the participant hospital and directly related to CJR episodes of care.

(ii) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment or make an alignment payment, a CJR collaborator other than a PGP must directly furnish a billable service to a CJR beneficiary during a CJR episode that occurred in the calendar year in which the savings or loss was created.

(iii) To be eligible to receive a gainsharing payment, a PGP that is a CJR collaborator must meet the following criteria:

(A) The PGP must have billed for an item or service that was rendered by one or more members of the PGP to a CJR beneficiary during a CJR episode that occurred during the calendar year in which the participant hospital's internal cost savings was generated, or to which the NPRA applied, the latter of which is contained in a reconciliation payment.

(B) The PGP must contribute to a participant hospital's care redesign in the CJR model and be clinically involved in the care of CJR beneficiaries. The following is a non-exhaustive list of ways in which a PGP might be clinically involved in the care of CJR beneficiaries:

(*1*) Provide care coordination services to CJR beneficiaries during and/or after inpatient admission.

(*2*) Engage with a participant hospital in care redesign strategies, and actually perform a role in implementing such strategies, that are designed to improve the quality of care for LEJR episodes and reduce the LEJR episode spending.

(*3*) In coordination with other providers and suppliers (such as members of the PGP, participant hospitals, post-acute care providers), implement strategies designed to address and manage the comorbidities of CJR beneficiaries.

(6) No entity or individual, whether a party to a collaborator agreement or not, may condition the opportunity to make or receive gainsharing payments or to make or receive alignment payments on the volume or value of referrals or business otherwise generated by, between or among the participant hospital, CJR collaborators, and any individual or entity affiliated with a participant hospital or CJR collaborator.

(7) Gainsharing payments, if any, must be -

(v) Be clearly identified and comply with all provisions in this part, as well as all applicable laws, statutes, and rules.

(8) Alignment payments from a CJR collaborator to a participant hospital may be made at any interval that is agreed upon by both parties, and must -

(i) Not be issued, distributed, or paid prior to the calculation by CMS of a repayment amount reflected in a reconciliation report; and

(ii) Not be a loan, advance payments, or payments for referrals or other business.

(9) A participant hospital must not make a gainsharing payment to a CJR collaborator that is subject to any action for noncompliance with this part or the fraud and abuse laws, or for the provision of substandard care in CJR episodes or other integrity problems.

(10) In a calendar year, the aggregate amount of all gainsharing payments distributed by a participant hospital that are derived from a CJR reconciliation payment may not exceed the amount of the reconciliation payment the participant hospital receives from CMS.

(11) In a calendar year, the aggregate amount of all alignment payments received by the participant hospital must not exceed 50 percent of the participant hospital's repayment amount. No alignment payments may be collected by a participant hospital if it does not owe a repayment amount.

(14) A sharing arrangement must not restrict the ability of a CJR collaborator to make decisions in the best interests of its patients, including the selection of devices, supplies, and treatments.

(15) The methodology for determining gainsharing payments must be based, at least in part, on criteria related to, and inclusive of, the quality of care to be delivered to CJR beneficiaries during an episode and must not directly account for the volume or value of referrals or business otherwise generated by, between or among the participant hospital, CJR collaborators, and any individual or entity affiliated with a participant hospital or CJR collaborator.

(16) The methodology for determining alignment payments must not directly account for the volume or value of referrals or business otherwise generated by, between or among the participant hospital, CJR collaborators, and any individual or entity affiliated with a participant hospital or CJR collaborator.

(17) The total amount of a gainsharing payment for a calendar year paid to an individual physician or nonphysician practitioner who is a CJR collaborator must not exceed 50 percent of the total Medicare approved amounts under the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) for services furnished to the participant hospital's CJR beneficiaries during a CJR episode by that physician or nonphysician practitioner.

(18) The total amount of gainsharing payments for a calendar year paid to a PGP that is a CJR collaborator must not exceed 50 percent of the total Medicare approved amounts under the Physician Fee Schedule for services that are billed by the PGP and furnished during a calendar year by members of the PGP to the participant hospital's CJR beneficiaries during CJR episodes.

(19) The participant hospital's determination of internal cost savings must satisfy the following criteria:

(i) Internal cost savings are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and Government Auditing Standards (The Yellow Book).
