(a) *Waiver of the SNF 3-day rule.* For episodes being tested in the CJR model in performance years 2 through 5, CMS waives the SNF 3-day rule for coverage of a SNF stay for a CJR beneficiary following the anchor hospitalization, but only if the SNF is identified on the applicable calendar quarter list of qualified SNFs at the time of CJR beneficiary admission to the SNF.

(1) CMS determines the qualified SNFs for each calendar quarter based on a review of the most recent rolling 12 months of overall star ratings on the Five-Star Quality Rating System for SNFs on the Nursing Home Compare Web site. Qualified SNFs are rated an overall of 3 stars or better for at least 7 of the 12 months.

(2) CMS posts to the CMS Web site the list of qualified SNFs in advance of the calendar quarter and the waiver only applies for a beneficiary who has been discharged from an anchor hospitalization if the SNF is included on the applicable calendar quarter list for the date of the beneficiary's admission to the SNF.

(b) *Other requirements.* All other Medicare rules for coverage and payment of Part A-covered SNF services continue to apply.
