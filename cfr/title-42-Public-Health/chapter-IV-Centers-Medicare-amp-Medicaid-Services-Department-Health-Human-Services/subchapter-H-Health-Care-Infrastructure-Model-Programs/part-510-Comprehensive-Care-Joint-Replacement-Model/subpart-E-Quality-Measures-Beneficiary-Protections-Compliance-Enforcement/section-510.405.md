(a) *Beneficiary choice.* The CJR model does not restrict Medicare beneficiaries' ability to choose any Medicare enrolled provider or supplier, or any physician or practitioner who has opted out of Medicare.

(1) As part of discharge planning and referral, participant hospitals must inform beneficiaries of all Medicare participating post-acute care providers in an area and must identify those post-acute care providers with whom they have sharing arrangements. Participant hospitals may recommend preferred providers and suppliers, consistent with applicable statutes and regulations. Participant hospitals may not limit beneficiary choice to any list of providers or suppliers in any manner other than that permitted under applicable statutes and regulations. Participant hospitals must respect patient and family preferences when they are expressed.

(2) Participant hospitals may not charge any CJR collaborator a fee to be included on any list of preferred providers or suppliers, nor may the participant hospital accept such payments.

(b) *Required beneficiary notification* - (1) *Hospital detailed notification.* Each participant hospital must provide written notice to any Medicare beneficiary that meets the criteria in § 510.205 of his or her inclusion in the CJR model. The notice must be upon admission to the participant hospital or immediately following the decision to schedule an LEJR surgery, whichever occurs later. The beneficiary notification must contain all of the following:

(i) A detailed explanation of the model and how it might be expected to affect the beneficiary's care.

(ii) Notification that the beneficiary retains freedom of choice to choose providers and services.

(iii) Explanation of how patients can access care records and claims data through an available patient portal, and how they can share access to their Blue Button® electronic health information with caregivers.

(iv) A statement that all existing Medicare beneficiary protections continue to be available to the beneficiary. These include the ability to report concerns of substandard care to Quality Improvement Organizations and 1-800-MEDICARE.

(v) A list of the providers and suppliers with whom the participant hospital has a collaborator agreement.

(2) *Physician provision of notice.* A participant hospital must require any physician that is a CJR collaborator to provide written notice of the structure of the model and the existence of the physician's sharing arrangement with the participant hospital to any Medicare beneficiary that meets the criteria specified in § 510.205. The notice must be provided at the time that the decision to undergo LEJR surgery is made.

(3) *PAC provider/supplier notification.* A participant hospital must require any provider or supplier, other than the treating physician discussed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, with whom it has executed a collaborator agreement to provide written notice of the existence of its sharing arrangement with the participant hospital to any Medicare beneficiary that meets the criteria specified in § 510.205. The notice must be provided no later than the time at which the beneficiary first receives services from the provider or supplier during the CJR episode.

(4) *Discharge planning notice.* A participant hospital must provide the beneficiary with a written notice of any potential financial liability, associated with non-covered services recommended or presented as an option as part of discharge planning, no later than the time that the beneficiary discusses a particular PAC option or at the time the beneficiary is discharged, whichever occurs earlier.

(i) If the hospital knows or should have known that the beneficiary is considering or has decided to receive a non-covered post-acute service or other non-covered associated service or supply, the hospital must notify the beneficiary that the service would not be covered by Medicare.

(ii) If the hospital is discharging a beneficiary to a SNF prior to the occurrence of a 3 day hospital stay, and the beneficiary is being transferred to or is considering a SNF that would not qualify under the SNF 3-day waiver in § 510.610, the hospital notify the beneficiary in accordance with paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section that the beneficiary will be responsible for costs associated with that stay except those which would be covered by Medicare Part B during a non-covered inpatient SNF stay.
