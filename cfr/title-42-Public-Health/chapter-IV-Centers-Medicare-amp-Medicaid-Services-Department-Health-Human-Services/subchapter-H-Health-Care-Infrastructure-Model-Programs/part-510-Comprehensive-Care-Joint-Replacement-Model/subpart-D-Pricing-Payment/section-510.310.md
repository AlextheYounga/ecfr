(a) *Notice of calculation error (first level of appeal).* Subject to the limitations on review in subpart d of this part, if a participant hospital wishes to dispute the calculation that involves a matter related to payment, reconciliation amounts, repayment amounts, or determinations associated with quality measures affecting payment, the hospital is required to provide written notice of the error, in a form and manner specified by CMS.

(1) Unless the participant hospital provides such notice, the CJR reconciliation report is deemed final 45 calendar days after it is issued.

(2) If CMS receives a timely notice of a calculation error, CMS responds in writing within 30 calendar days to either confirm that there was an error in the calculation or verify that the calculation is correct, although CMS reserves the right to an extension upon written notice to the participant hospital.

(3) If a participant hospital does not submit timely notice of a calculation error in accordance with the timelines and processes specified by CMS, then CMS deems final the CJR reconciliation report and proceeds with the payment or repayment processes, as applicable.

(4) Only participant hospitals may use the dispute resolution process described in this part.

(b) *Dispute resolution process (second level of appeal).* (1) If the participant hospital is dissatisfied with CMS's response to the notice of a calculation error, the participant hospital may request a reconsideration review in a form and manner as specified by CMS.

(2) The reconsideration review request must provide a detailed explanation of the basis for the dispute and include supporting documentation for the participant hospital's assertion that CMS or its representatives did not accurately calculate the NPRA, the reconciliation payment, or the repayment amount in accordance with ยง 510.305.

(3) If CMS does not receive a request for reconsideration from the participant hospital within 10 calendar days of the issue date of CMS's response to the participant hospital's notice of calculation error, then CMS's response to the calculation error is deemed final and CMS proceeds with reconciliation payment or repayment processes, as applicable, as described in ยง 510.305.

(4) A CMS reconsideration official notifies the participant hospital in writing within 15 calendar days of receiving the participant hospital's review request of the following:

(i) The date, time, and location of the review.

(ii) The issues in dispute.

(iii) The review procedures.

(iv) The procedures (including format and deadlines) for submission of evidence.

(5) The CMS reconsideration official takes all reasonable efforts to schedule the review to occur no later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the notification.

(6) The provisions at ยง 425.804(b), (c), and (e) of this chapter are applicable to reviews conducted in accordance with the reconsideration review process for CJR.

(7) The CMS reconsideration official issues a written determination within 30 days of the review. The determination is final and binding.

(c) *Exception to the process.* If the participant hospital contests a matter that does not involve an issue contained in, or a calculation which contributes to, a CJR reconciliation report, a notice of calculation error is not required. An example of such a matter is termination of the participant hospital from the model. In those instances, if CMS does not receive a request for reconsideration from the participant hospital within 10 calendar days of the notice of the initial determination, the initial determination is deemed final and CMS proceeds with action indicated in the initial determination.

(3) The elements, parameters, scope, and duration of such models for testing or dissemination.

(4) Determinations regarding budget neutrality under section 1115A(b)(3) of Act.

(5) The termination or modification of the design and implementation of a model under section 1115A(b)(3)(B) of Act.

(6) Decisions about expansion of the duration and scope of a model under section 1115A(c) of the Act, including the determination that a model is not expected to meet criteria described in paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section.
