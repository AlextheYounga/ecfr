(a) After an individual appellant has submitted a request for a hearing, the ALJ determines the amount in controversy in accordance with § 405.740(a) of this chapter for Part A services or § 405.817(a) of this chapter for Part B services. When two or more appellants submit a request for hearing, the ALJ determines the amount in controversy in accordance with § 405.740(b) of this chapter for Part A services and § 405.817(b) of this chapter for Part B services.

(c) At the end of the 15-day period, if the ALJ determines that the amount in controversy is less than $200, the ALJ, without holding a hearing, dismisses the request for a hearing without ruling on the substantive issues involved in the appeal and notifies the parties to the hearing and the QIO that the QIO reconsidered determination is conclusive for Medicare payment purposes.
