(a) The agency may provide Medicaid to any group or groups of individuals specified under ยง 435.201 (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) who would meet the income and resource requirements under the State's approved AFDC plan if their work-related child care costs were paid from their earnings rather than by a State agency as a service expenditure.

(b) The agency may use this option only if the State's AFDC plan deducts work-related child care costs from income to determine the amount of AFDC.
