(a) The agency may provide Medicaid to any group or groups of individuals specified under ยง 435.210 (a)(4), (a)(5), and (a)(6) who:

(1) Would be eligible for AFDC if the State's AFDC plan included individuals whose coverage under title IV-A is optional (for example, Medicaid may be provided to members of families with an unemployed parent even though AFDC is not available to them under the State's AFDC plan); or
