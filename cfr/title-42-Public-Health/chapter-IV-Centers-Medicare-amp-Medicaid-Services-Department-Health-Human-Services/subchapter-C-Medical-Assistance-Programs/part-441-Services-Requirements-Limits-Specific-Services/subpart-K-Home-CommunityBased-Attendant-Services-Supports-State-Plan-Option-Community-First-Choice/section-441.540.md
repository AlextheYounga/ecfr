(7) Includes a method for the individual to request updates to the plan.

(8) Records the alternative home and community-based settings that were considered by the individual.

(b) *The person-centered service plan.* The person-centered service plan must reflect the services and supports that are important for the individual to meet the needs identified through an assessment of functional need, as well as what is important to the individual with regard to preferences for the delivery of such services and supports. Commensurate with the level of need of the individual, and the scope of services and supports available under Community First Choice, the plan must:

(6) Reflect risk factors and measures in place to minimize them, including individualized backup plans.

(7) Be understandable to the individual receiving services and supports, and the individuals important in supporting him or her.
