##### ยง 431.822 Resolution of differences in State and Federal case eligibility or payment findings. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 31184, July 5, 2017.

(a) When a difference exists between State and Federal case eligibility or payment findings, the Regional Office will notify the agency by a difference letter.

(b) The agency must return the difference letter to the Regional Office within 28 calendar days of the date of the letter indicating either agreement with the Federal finding or reasons for disagreement and if the agency desires a conference to resolve the difference. This period may be shortened if the Regional Office finds that it is necessary to do so in order to meet a case completion deadline, and the State still has a reasonable period of time in which to respond to the letter. If the agency fails to submit the difference letter indicating its agreement or disagreement with the Federal findings within the 28 calendar days (or the shorter period designated as described above), the Federal findings will be sustained.

(c) If the Regional Office disagrees with the agency's response, a difference conference will be scheduled within 20 days of the request of the agency. If a difference cannot be resolved, the State may request a direct presentation of its position to the Regional Administrator. The Regional Administrator has final authority for resolving the difference.
