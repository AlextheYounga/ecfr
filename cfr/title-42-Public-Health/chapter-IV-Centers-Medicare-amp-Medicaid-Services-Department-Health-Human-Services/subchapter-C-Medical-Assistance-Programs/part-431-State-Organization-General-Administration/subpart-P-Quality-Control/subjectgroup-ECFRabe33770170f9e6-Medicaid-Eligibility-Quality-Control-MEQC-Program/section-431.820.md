##### ยง 431.820 Corrective action under the MEQC program. #####

The agency must -

(a) Take action to correct any active or negative case action errors found in the sample cases;

(b) Take administrative action to prevent or reduce the incidence of those errors; and

(c) By September 15 each year, submit to CMS a report on its error rate analysis and a corrective action plan based on that analysis. The agency must submit revisions to the plan within 60 days of identification of additional error-prone areas, other significant changes in the error rate (that is, changes that the State experiences that increase or decrease its error rate and necessitate immediate corrective action or discontinuance of corrective actions that effectively control the cause of the error rate change), or changes in planned corrective action.
