(iv) Examine the evidence in the case file that supports categorical and financial eligibility for the category of coverage in which the case is assigned, and independently verify information that is missing, outdated (older than 12 months) and likely to change, or otherwise as needed, to verify eligibility.

(v) For managed care cases, also verify residency and eligibility for and actual enrollment in the managed care plan during the month under review.

(2) *Active cases - CHIP.* In addition to the procedures for active cases as set forth in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (e)(1)(vii) of this section, the agency must verify that the case is not eligible for Medicaid by determining that the child has income above the Medicaid levels in accordance with the requirements in § 457.350 of this chapter. Upon verification, the agency must -

(e) *Negative cases - Medicaid and CHIP.* The agency must -

(2) Examine the evidence in the case file to determine whether the State agency's denial or termination was correct or whether there is any reason the case should have been denied or terminated; and

(ii) Record the case as an error if there is no valid reason for the denial or termination.

(f) *Substitution of MEQC data.* (1) A State in their PERM year may elect to substitute the random sample of selected cases, eligibility review findings, and payment review findings, as qualified by paragraphs (d)(2) and (d)(3) of this section, which are obtained through MEQC reviews conducted in accordance with section 1903(u) of the Act for data required in this section, as long as the State MEQC reviews meet the requirements of the MEQC Sampling Plan and Procedures at § 431.814 of this part, and if the only exclusions are those set forth in section 1902(e)(13) of the Act, § 431.814(c)(4), and § 431.978(d)(1) of this part.
