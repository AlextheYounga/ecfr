##### ยง 431.992 Corrective action plan. #####

(b) In developing a corrective action plan, the State must take the following actions:

(1) *Data analysis.* States must conduct data analysis such as reviewing clusters of errors, general error causes, characteristics, and frequency of errors that are associated with improper payments.

(2) *Program analysis.* States must review the findings of the data analysis to determine the specific programmatic causes to which errors are attributed (for example, provider lack of understanding of the requirement to provide documentation) and to identify root error causes.

(3) *Corrective action planning.* States must determine the corrective actions to be implemented that address the root error causes.

(4) *Implementation and monitoring.*
