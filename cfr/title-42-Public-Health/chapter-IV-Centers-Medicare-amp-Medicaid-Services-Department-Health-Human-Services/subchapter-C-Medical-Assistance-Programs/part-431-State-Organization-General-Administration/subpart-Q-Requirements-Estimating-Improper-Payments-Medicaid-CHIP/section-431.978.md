##### ยง 431.978 Eligibility sampling plan and procedures. #####

(a) *Plan approval.* For each review year, the agency must -

(1) Submit its Medicaid or CHIP sampling plan (or revisions to a current plan) for both active and negative cases to CMS for approval by the August 1 before the review year; and

(2) Have its sampling plan approved by CMS before the plan is implemented.

(b) *Maintain current plan.* The agency must do both of the following:

(1) Keep its plan current, for example, by making adjustments to the plan when necessary due to fluctuations in the universe.

(2) Review its plan each review year. If it is determined that the approved plan is -

(i) Unchanged from the previous review year, the agency must notify CMS that it is using the plan from the previous review year; or

(ii) Changed from the previous review year, the agency must submit a revised plan for CMS approval.

(c) *Sample size.* (1) *Precision and confidence levels.* Annual sample size for eligibility reviews should be estimated to achieve within a 3 percent precision level at 95 percent confidence interval for the eligibility component of the program.

(2) *Base year sample size.* Annual sample size for each State's base year of PERM is -

(i) Five hundred four active cases and 204 negative cases drawn from the active and negative universes; or

(ii) If the active case universe or negative case universe of Medicaid or CHIP beneficiaries from which the annual sample is drawn is less than 10,000, the State may request to reduce its sample size by the finite population correction factor for the relevant PERM cycle.

(3) *Subsequent year sample size.* In PERM cycles following the base year the annual sample size may increase or decrease based on the State's prior results of the previous cycle PERM error rate information. The State may provide information to CMS in the eligibility sampling plan due to CMS by the August 1 prior to the start of the review year to support the calculation of a reduced annual sample size for the next PERM cycle.

(i) CMS considers the error rate from the State's previous PERM cycle to determine the State's annual sample size for the current PERM cycle.

(ii) The maximum sample size is 1,000 for the active cases and negative cases, respectively.

(iii) If the active case universe or negative case universe of Medicaid or CHIP beneficiaries from which the annual sample is drawn is less than 10,000, the State may request to reduce its sample size by the finite population correction factor for the relevant PERM cycle.

(iv) If a State measured in the FY 2007 or FY 2008 cycle elects to reject its PERM CHIP rate as determined during those cycles, information from those cycles is not used to calculate the State's sample size in subsequent PERM cycles and the State's sample size in its base year is 504 active cases and 204 negative cases.

(d) *Sample selection.* The sample must be stratified in accordance with ยง 431.978(d)(3). Cases must be selected each month throughout the fiscal year under review. Each month throughout the year and before commencing the eligibility reviews, States must submit to CMS a monthly sample selection list that identifies the cases selected in that month.

(1) *Eligibility universe-active cases* - (i) *Medicaid.* (A) The Medicaid active universe consists of all active Medicaid cases funded through Title XIX for the sample month.

(B) The following types of cases are excluded from the Medicaid active universe:

(*1*) Cases for which the Social Security Administration, under section 1634 of the Act agreement with a State, determines Medicaid eligibility for Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries.

(*2*) All foster care and adoption assistance cases under Title IV-E of the Act are excluded from the universe in all States.

(*3*) Cases under active fraud investigation.

(*4*) Cases in which eligibility was determined under section 1902(e)(13) of the Act for States' Express Lane Eligibility option.

(C) If the State cannot identify cases that meet the exclusion criteria specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section before sample selection, the State must drop these cases from review if they are selected in the sample and are later determined to meet the exclusion criteria specified in paragraph (d)(1)(i)(B) of this section.

(ii) *CHIP.* (A) The CHIP active universe consists of all active case CHIP and Title XXI Medicaid expansion cases that are funded through Title XXI for the sample month.

(B) The following types of cases are excluded from the CHIP active universe:

(*1*) Cases under active fraud investigation.

(*2*) Cases in which eligibility was determined under section 2107(e)(1) of the Act for States' Express Lane Eligibility option.

(C) If the State cannot identify cases that meet the exclusion criteria specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section before sample selection, the State must drop these cases from review if it is later determined that the cases meet the exclusion criteria specified in paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section.

(2) *Eligibility universe - negative cases.* The Medicaid and CHIP negative universe consists of all negative cases for the sample month. The negative case universe is not stratified.

(3) *Stratifying the universe.* States have the option to stratify the active case universe.

(i) Each month, the State may stratify the Medicaid and CHIP active case universe into three strata:

(A) Program applications completed by the beneficiaries in which the State took action in the sample month to approve such beneficiaries for Medicaid or CHIP based on the eligibility determination.

(B) Redeterminations of eligibility in which the State took action in the sample month to approve the beneficiaries for Medicaid or CHIP based on information obtained through a completed redetermination.

(C) All other cases.

(ii) States that do not stratify the universe will sample from the entire active case universe each month.

(4) *Sample selection.* Each month, an equal number of cases are selected for review from one of the following:

(i) Each stratum as described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.

(ii) The entire active case universe if opting not to stratify cases under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section.

(iii) Otherwise provided for in the State's sampling plan approved by CMS.
