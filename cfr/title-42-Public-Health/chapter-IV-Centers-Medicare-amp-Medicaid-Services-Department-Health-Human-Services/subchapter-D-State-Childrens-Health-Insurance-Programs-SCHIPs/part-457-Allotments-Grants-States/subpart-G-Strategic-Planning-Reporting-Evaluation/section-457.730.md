(d) *Documentation requirements for APIs.* For each API implemented in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, a State must make publicly accessible, by posting directly on its website or via publicly accessible hyperlink(s), complete accompanying documentation that contains, at a minimum the information listed in this paragraph. For the purposes of this section, “publicly accessible” means that any person using commonly available technology to browse the internet could access the information without any preconditions or additional steps, such as a fee for access to the documentation; a requirement to receive a copy of the material via email; a requirement to register or create an account to receive the documentation; or a requirement to read promotional material or agree to receive future communications from the organization making the documentation available;

(2) Makes this determination using objective, verifiable criteria that are applied fairly and consistently across all apps and developers through which parties seek to access electronic health information, as defined in 45 CFR 171.102, including but not limited to criteria that rely on automated monitoring and risk mitigation tools.

(g) *Beneficiary resources regarding privacy and security.* A State must provide in an easily accessible location on its public website and through other appropriate mechanisms through which it ordinarily communicates with current and former beneficiaries seeking to access their health information held by the State CHIP agency, educational resources in non-technical, simple and easy-to-understand language explaining at a minimum—

(1) General information on steps the individual may consider taking to help protect the privacy and security of their health information, including factors to consider in selecting an application including secondary uses of data, and the importance of understanding the security and privacy practices of any application to which they will entrust their health information; and
