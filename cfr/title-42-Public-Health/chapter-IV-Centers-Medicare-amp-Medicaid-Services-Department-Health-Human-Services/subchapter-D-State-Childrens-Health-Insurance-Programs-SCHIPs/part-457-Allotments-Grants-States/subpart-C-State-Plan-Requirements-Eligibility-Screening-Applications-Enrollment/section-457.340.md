Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 86464, Nov. 30, 2016.

(a) Application and renewal assistance, availability of program information, and Internet Web site. The terms of §§ 435.905, 435.906, 435.907(h), 435.908, and 435.1200(f) of this chapter apply equally to the State in administering a separate CHIP.

(b) *Use of Social Security number.* The terms of §§ 435.910 and 435.907(e) of this chapter regarding the provision and use of Social Security Numbers and non-applicant information apply equally to the State in administering a separate CHIP.

(c) *Notice of rights and responsibilities.* A State must inform applicants at the time of application, in writing and orally if appropriate, about the application and eligibility requirements, the time frame for determining eligibility, and the right to review of eligibility determinations as described in § 457.1130.

(d) *Timely determination of eligibility.* (1) The terms in § 435.912 of this chapter apply equally to CHIP, except that standards for transferring electronic accounts to other insurance affordability programs are pursuant to § 457.350 and the standards for receiving applications from other insurance affordability programs are pursuant to § 457.348 of this part.

(2) In applying timeliness standards, the State must define “date of application” and must count each calendar day from the date of application to the day the agency provides notice of its eligibility decision.

(3) In the case of individuals subject to a period of uninsurance under this part, the state must identify and implement processes to facilitate enrollment of CHIP-eligible children who have satisfied a period of uninsurance (as described under § 457.805). To minimize burden on individuals, a state may not require a new application or information already provided by a family immediately preceding the beginning of a waiting period. States must also ensure that the proper safeguards are in place to prevent a disruption in coverage for children transitioning from coverage under another insurance affordability program after the completion of a period of uninsurance.

(e) *Notice of decision concerning eligibility.* A State must provide each applicant or enrollee a written notice of any decision on the application or other determination concerning eligibility.

(1) If eligibility is approved, the notice must include information on the enrollee's rights and responsibilities under the program, including the opportunity for review of matters described in § 457.1130.

(2) If eligibility is denied, suspended or terminated, the State must provide notice in accordance with § 457.1180. In the case of a suspension or termination of eligibility, the State must provide sufficient notice to enable the child's parent or caretaker to take any appropriate actions that may be required to allow coverage to continue without interruption.

(f) *Effective date of eligibility.* A State must specify a method for determining the effective date of eligibility for CHIP, which can be determined based on the date of application or through any other reasonable method that ensures coordinated transition of children between CHIP and other insurance affordability programs as family circumstances change and avoids gaps or overlaps in coverage.
