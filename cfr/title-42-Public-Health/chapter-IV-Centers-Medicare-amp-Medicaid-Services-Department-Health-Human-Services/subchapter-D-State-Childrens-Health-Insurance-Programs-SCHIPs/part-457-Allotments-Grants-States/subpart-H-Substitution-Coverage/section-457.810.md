##### § 457.810 Premium assistance programs: Required protections against substitution. #####

A State that operates a premium assistance program, as defined at § 457.10, must provide the protections against substitution of CHIP coverage for coverage under group health plans specified in this section. The State must describe these protections in the State plan; and report on results of monitoring of substitution in its annual reports.

(a) *Period without coverage under a group health plan.* For health benefits coverage provided through premium assistance for group health plans, the following rules apply:

(1) Any waiting period imposed under the state child health plan prior to the provision of child health assistance to a targeted low-income child under the state plan shall apply to the same extent to the provision of a premium assistance subsidy for the child and shall not exceed 90 days.

(2) States must permit the same exemptions to the required waiting period for premium assistance as specified under the state plan at § 457.805(a)(2), and § 457.805(a)(3) for the provision of child health assistance to a targeted low-income child.

(b) *Employer contribution.* For health benefits coverage obtained through premium assistance for group health plans, the employee who is eligible for the coverage must apply for the full premium contribution available from the employer.

(c) *Cost effectiveness.* In establishing cost effectiveness—

(1) The State's cost for coverage for children under premium assistance programs must not be greater than the cost of other CHIP coverage for these children; and

(2) The State may base its demonstration of cost effectiveness on an assessment of the cost of coverage for children under premium assistance programs to the cost of other CHIP coverage for these children, done on a case-by-case basis, or on the cost of premium assisted coverage in the aggregate.

(d) *State evaluation.* The State must evaluate and report in the annual report (in accordance with § 457.750(b)(2)) the amount of substitution that occurs as a result of premium assistance programs and the effect of those programs on access to coverage.
