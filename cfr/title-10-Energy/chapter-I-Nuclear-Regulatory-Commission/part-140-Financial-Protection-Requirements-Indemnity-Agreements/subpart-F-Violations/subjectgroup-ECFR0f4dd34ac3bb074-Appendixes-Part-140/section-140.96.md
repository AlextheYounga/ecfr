##### § 140.96 Appendix F—Indemnity locations. #####

(a) *Geographical boundaries of indemnity locations.* (1) In every indemnity agreement between the Commission and a licensee which affords indemnity protection for the preoperational storage of fuel at the site of a nuclear power reactor under construction, the geographical boundaries of the indemnity location will include the entire construction area of the nuclear power reactor, as determined by the Commission. Such area will not necessarily be coextensive with the indemnity location which will be established at the time an operating license or combined license under 10 CFR part 52 is issued for such additional nuclear power reactors.

(2) In every indemnity agreement between the Commission and a licensee which affords indemnity protection for an existing nuclear power reactor, the geographical boundaries of the indemnity location shall include the entire construction area of any additional nuclear power reactor as determined by the Commission, built as part of the same power station by the same licensee. Such area will not necessarily be coextensive with the indemnity location which will be established at the time an operating license or combined license is issued for such additional nuclear power reactors.

(3) This section is effective May 1, 1973, as to construction permits issued before March 2, 1973, and, as to construction permits and combined licenses issued on or after March 2, 1973, the provisions of this section will apply no later than such time as a construction permit or combined license is issued authorizing construction of any additional nuclear power reactor.

(b) [Reserved]
