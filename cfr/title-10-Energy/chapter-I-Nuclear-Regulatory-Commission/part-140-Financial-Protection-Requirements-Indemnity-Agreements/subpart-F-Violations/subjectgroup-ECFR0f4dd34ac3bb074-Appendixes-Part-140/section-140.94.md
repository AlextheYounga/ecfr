(e) Shall be effective only with respect to those obligations set forth in this agreement;

(f) Shall not apply to, or prejudice the prosecution or defense of, any claim or portion of claim which is not within the protection afforded under (1) the limit of liability provisions under subsection 170(e), of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and (2) the terms of this agreement.
