Previous examinations of these welds can be credited for baseline examinations only if they were performed within the re-inspection period for the weld item in Table 1 of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-2 and the examination of each weld meets the examination requirements of paragraphs -2500(a) or -2500(b) of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-2 as conditioned in this section. Other previous examinations that do not meet these requirements can be used to meet the baseline examination requirement, provided NRC approval in accordance with paragraph (z)(1) or (2) of this section, is granted prior to the end of the next refueling outage.

(*4*) *Examination coverage.* When implementing Paragraph -2500(a) of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-2, essentially 100 percent of the required volumetric examination coverage shall be obtained, including greater than 90 percent of the volumetric examination coverage for circumferential flaws. Licensees are prohibited from using Paragraphs -2500(c) and -2500(d) of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-2 to meet examination requirements.

(*5*) *Inlay/onlay inspection frequency.* All hot-leg operating temperature welds in Inspection Items G, H, J, and K shall be inspected each inspection interval. A 25 percent sample of Inspection Items G, H, J, and K cold-leg operating temperature welds shall be inspected whenever the core barrel is removed (unless it has already been inspected within the past 10 years) or within 20 years, whichever is less.

(*6*) *Reporting requirements.* For any mitigated weld whose volumetric examination detects growth of existing flaws in the required examination volume that exceed the previous IWB-3600 flaw evaluations or new flaws, a report summarizing the evaluation, along with inputs, methodologies, assumptions, and causes of the new flaw or flaw growth is to be provided to the NRC prior to the weld being placed in service other than modes 5 or 6.

(*7*) *Defining “t”.* For Inspection Items G, H, J, and K, when applying the acceptance standards of ASME BPV Code, Section XI, IWB-3514, for planar flaws contained within the inlay or onlay, the thickness “t” in IWB-3514 is the thickness of the inlay or onlay. For planar flaws in the balance of the dissimilar metal weld examination volume, the thickness “t” in IWB-3514 is the combined thickness of the inlay or onlay and the dissimilar metal weld.

(*8*) *Optimized weld overlay examination.* Initial inservice examination of Inspection Item C-2 welds shall be performed between the third refueling outage and no later than 10 years after application of the overlay.

(*9*) *Deferral.* Note (11)(b)(1) in ASME BPV Code Case N-770-2 shall not be used to defer the initial inservice examination of optimized weld overlays (*i.e.,* Inspection Item C-2 of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-2).

(*10*) *Examination technique.* Note 14(b) of Table 1 and Note (b) of Figure 5(a) of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-2 may only be implemented if the requirements of Note 14(a) of Table 1 of ASME BPV Code Case N-770-2 cannot be met.

(*11*) *Cast stainless steel.* Examination of ASME BPV Code Class 1 piping and vessel nozzle butt welds involving cast stainless steel materials, shall be performed with Appendix VIII, Supplement 9 qualifications, or qualifications similar to Appendix VIII, Supplement 2 or 10 using cast stainless steel mockups no later than the next scheduled weld examination after January 1, 2022, in accordance with the requirements of Paragraph -2500(a).

(*12*) *Stress improvement inspection coverage.* Under Paragraph I.5.1, for cast stainless steel items, the required examination volume shall be examined by Appendix VIII procedures to the maximum extent practical including 100 percent of the susceptible material volume.

(*13*) *Encoded ultrasonic examination.* Ultrasonic examinations of non-mitigated or cracked mitigated dissimilar metal butt welds in the reactor coolant pressure boundary must be performed in accordance with the requirements of Table 1 for Inspection Item A-1, A-2, B, E, F-2, J, and K for 100 percent of the required inspection volume using an encoded method.

(h) *Protection and safety systems.* Protection systems of nuclear power reactors of all types must meet the requirements specified in this paragraph. Each combined license for a utilization facility is subject to the following conditions.

(1) [Reserved]

(2) *Protection systems.* For nuclear power plants with construction permits issued after January 1, 1971, but before May 13, 1999, protection systems must meet the requirements in IEEE Std 279-1968, “Proposed IEEE Criteria for Nuclear Power Plant Protection Systems,” or the requirements in IEEE Std 279-1971, “Criteria for Protection Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” or the requirements in IEEE Std 603-1991, “Criteria for Safety Systems for Nuclear Power Generating Stations,” and the correction sheet dated January 30, 1995. For nuclear power plants with construction permits issued before January 1, 1971, protection systems must be consistent with their licensing basis or may meet the requirements of IEEE Std. 603-1991 and the correction sheet dated January 30, 1995.

(3) *Safety systems.* Applications filed on or after May 13, 1999, for construction permits and operating licenses under this part, and for design approvals, design certifications, and combined licenses under part 52 of this chapter, must meet the requirements for safety systems in IEEE Std. 603-1991 and the correction sheet dated January 30, 1995.

(i)-(y) [Reserved]

(z) *Alternatives to codes and standards requirements.* Alternatives to the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (h) of this section or portions thereof may be used when authorized by the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, or Director, Office of New Reactors, as appropriate. A proposed alternative must be submitted and authorized prior to implementation. The applicant or licensee must demonstrate that:

(1) *Acceptable level of quality and safety.* The proposed alternative would provide an acceptable level of quality and safety; or

(2) *Hardship without a compensating increase in quality and safety.* Compliance with the specified requirements of this section would result in hardship or unusual difficulty without a compensating increase in the level of quality and safety. Footnotes to § 50.55a:

1 USAS and ASME Code addenda issued prior to the winter 1977 Addenda are considered to be “in effect” or “effective” 6 months after their date of issuance and after they are incorporated by reference in paragraph (a) of this section. Addenda to the ASME Code issued after the summer 1977 Addenda are considered to be “in effect” or “effective” after the date of publication of the addenda and after they are incorporated by reference in paragraph (a) of this section.

2-3 [Reserved].

4 For ASME Code editions and addenda issued prior to the winter 1977 Addenda, the Code edition and addenda applicable to the component is governed by the order or contract date for the component, not the contract date for the nuclear energy system. For the winter 1977 Addenda and subsequent editions and addenda the method for determining the applicable Code editions and addenda is contained in Paragraph NCA 1140 of Section III of the ASME Code.

5-6 [Reserved].
