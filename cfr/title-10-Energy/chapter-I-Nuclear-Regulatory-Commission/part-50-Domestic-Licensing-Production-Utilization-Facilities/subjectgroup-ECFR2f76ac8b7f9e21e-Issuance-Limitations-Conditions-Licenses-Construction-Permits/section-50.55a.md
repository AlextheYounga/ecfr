(B) *Augmented ISI requirements: Submitting containment ISI programs.* Licensees do not have to submit to the NRC for approval of their containment inservice inspection programs that were developed to satisfy the requirements of Subsection IWE and Subsection IWL with specified conditions. The program elements and the required documentation must be maintained on site for audit.

(C) *Augmented ISI requirements: Implementation of Appendix VIII to Section XI.* (*1*) Appendix VIII and the supplements to Appendix VIII to Section XI, Division 1, 1995 Edition with the 1996 Addenda of the ASME BPV Code must be implemented in accordance with the following schedule: Appendix VIII and Supplements 1, 2, 3, and 8 - May 22, 2000; Supplements 4 and 6 - November 22, 2000; Supplement 11 - November 22, 2001; and Supplements 5, 7, and 10 - November 22, 2002.

(*2*) Licensees implementing the 1989 Edition and earlier editions and addenda of IWA-2232 of Section XI, Division 1, of the ASME BPV Code must implement the 1995 Edition with the 1996 Addenda of Appendix VIII and the supplements to Appendix VIII of Section XI, Division 1, of the ASME BPV Code.

(D) *Augmented ISI requirements: Reactor vessel head inspections* - (*1*) All licensees of pressurized water reactors must augment their inservice inspection program with ASME Code Case N-729-1, subject to the conditions specified in paragraphs (g)(6)(ii)(D)(*2*) through (*6*) of this section. Licensees of existing operating reactors as of September 10, 2008, must implement their augmented inservice inspection program by December 31, 2008. Once a licensee implements this requirement, the First Revised NRC Order EA-03-009 no longer applies to that licensee and shall be deemed to be withdrawn.

(*2*) Note 9 of ASME Code Case N-729-1 must not be implemented.

(*3*) Instead of the specified “examination method” requirements for volumetric and surface examinations in Note 6 of Table 1 of Code Case N-729-1, the licensee must perform volumetric and/or surface examination of essentially 100 percent of the required volume or equivalent surfaces of the nozzle tube, as identified by Figure 2 of ASME Code Case N-729-1. A demonstrated volumetric or surface leak path assessment through all J-groove welds must be performed. If a surface examination is being substituted for a volumetric examination on a portion of a penetration nozzle that is below the toe of the J-groove weld [Point E on Figure 2 of ASME Code Case N-729-1], the surface examination must be of the inside and outside wetted surface of the penetration nozzle not examined volumetrically.

(*4*) By September 1, 2009, ultrasonic examinations must be performed using personnel, procedures, and equipment that have been qualified by blind demonstration on representative mockups using a methodology that meets the conditions specified in paragraphs (g)(6)(ii)(D)(*4*)(*i*) through (*iv*), instead of the qualification requirements of Paragraph -2500 of ASME Code Case N-729-1. References herein to Section XI, Appendix VIII, must be to the 2004 Edition with no addenda of the ASME BPV Code.

(*i*) The specimen set must have an applicable thickness qualification range of + 25 percent to −40 percent for nominal depth through-wall thickness. The specimen set must include geometric and material conditions that normally require discrimination from primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) flaws.

(*ii*) The specimen set must have a minimum of ten (10) flaws that provide an acoustic response similar to PWSCC indications. All flaws must be greater than 10 percent of the nominal pipe wall thickness. A minimum of 20 percent of the total flaws must initiate from the inside surface and 20 percent from the outside surface. At least 20 percent of the flaws must be in the depth ranges of 10-30 percent through-wall thickness and at least 20 percent within a depth range of 31-50 percent through-wall thickness. At least 20 percent and no more than 60 percent of the flaws must be oriented axially.

(*iii*) Procedures must identify the equipment and essential variables and settings used for the qualification, in accordance with Subarticle VIII-2100 of Section XI, Appendix VIII. The procedure must be requalified when an essential variable is changed outside the demonstration range as defined by Subarticle VIII-3130 of Section XI, Appendix VIII, and as allowed by Articles VIII-4100, VIII-4200, and VIII-4300 of Section XI, Appendix VIII. Procedure qualification must include the equivalent of at least three personnel performance demonstration test sets. Procedure qualification requires at least one successful personnel performance demonstration.

(*iv*) Personnel performance demonstration test acceptance criteria must meet the personnel performance demonstration detection test acceptance criteria of Table VIII - S10-1 of Section XI, Appendix VIII, Supplement 10. Examination procedures, equipment, and personnel are qualified for depth sizing and length sizing when the RMS error, as defined by Subarticle VIII-3120 of Section XI, Appendix VIII, of the flaw depth measurements, as compared to the true flaw depths, do not exceed1/8 inch (3 mm) and the root mean square (RMS) error of the flaw length measurements, as compared to the true flaw lengths, do not exceed3/8 inch (10 mm), respectively.

(*5*) If flaws attributed to PWSCC have been identified, whether acceptable or not for continued service under Paragraphs -3130 or -3140 of ASME Code Case N-729-1, the re-inspection interval must be each refueling outage instead of the re-inspection intervals required by Table 1, Note (8), of ASME Code Case N-729-1.

(*6*) Appendix I of ASME Code Case N-729-1 must not be implemented without prior NRC approval.

(E) *Augmented ISI requirements: Reactor coolant pressure boundary visual inspections*10 - (*1*) All licensees of pressurized water reactors must augment their inservice inspection program by implementing ASME Code Case N-722-1, subject to the conditions specified in paragraphs (g)(6)(ii)(E)(*2*) through (*4*) of this section. The inspection requirements of ASME Code Case N-722-1 do not apply to components with pressure retaining welds fabricated with Alloy 600/82/182 materials that have been mitigated by weld overlay or stress improvement.

(*2*) If a visual examination determines that leakage is occurring from a specific item listed in Table 1 of ASME Code Case N-722-1 that is not exempted by the ASME Code, Section XI, IWB-1220(b)(1), additional actions must be performed to characterize the location, orientation, and length of a crack or cracks in Alloy 600 nozzle wrought material and location, orientation, and length of a crack or cracks in Alloy 82/182 butt welds. Alternatively, licensees may replace the Alloy 600/82/182 materials in all the components under the item number of the leaking component.

(*3*) If the actions in paragraph (g)(6)(ii)(E)(*2*) of this section determine that a flaw is circumferentially oriented and potentially a result of primary water stress corrosion cracking, licensees must perform non-visual NDE inspections of components that fall under that ASME Code Case N-722-1 item number. The number of components inspected must equal or exceed the number of components found to be leaking under that item number. If circumferential cracking is identified in the sample, non-visual NDE must be performed in the remaining components under that item number.

(*4*) If ultrasonic examinations of butt welds are used to meet the NDE requirements in paragraphs (g)(6)(ii)(E)(*2*) or (*3*) of this section, they must be performed using the appropriate supplement of Section XI, Appendix VIII, of the ASME BPV Code.

(F) *Augmented ISI requirements: Examination requirements for Class 1 piping and nozzle dissimilar-metal butt welds* - (*1*) Licensees of existing, operating pressurized-water reactors as of July 21, 2011, must implement the requirements of ASME Code Case N-770-1, subject to the conditions specified in paragraphs (g)(6)(ii)(F)(*2*) through (*10*) of this section, by the first refueling outage after August 22, 2011.

(*2*) Full structural weld overlays authorized by the NRC staff may be categorized as Inspection Items C or F, as appropriate. Welds that have been mitigated by the Mechanical Stress Improvement Process (MSIPTM) may be categorized as Inspection Items D or E, as appropriate, provided the criteria in Appendix I of the Code Case have been met. For ISI frequencies, all other butt welds that rely on Alloy 82/182 for structural integrity must be categorized as Inspection Items A-1, A-2 or B until the NRC staff has reviewed the mitigation and authorized an alternative Code Case Inspection Item for the mitigated weld, or until an alternative Code Case Inspection Item is used based on conformance with an ASME mitigation Code Case endorsed in Regulatory Guide 1.147 with conditions, if applicable, and incorporated by reference in this section.

(*3*) Baseline examinations for welds in Table 1, Inspection Items A-1, A-2, and B, must be completed by the end of the next refueling outage after January 20, 2012. Previous examinations of these welds can be credited for baseline examinations if they were performed within the re-inspection period for the weld item in Table 1 using Section XI, Appendix VIII, requirements and met the Code required examination volume of essentially 100 percent. Other previous examinations that do not meet these requirements can be used to meet the baseline examination requirement, provided NRC approval of alternative inspection requirements in accordance with paragraphs (z)(1) or (2) of this section is granted prior to the end of the next refueling outage after January 20, 2012.

(*4*) The axial examination coverage requirements of Paragraph - 2500(c) may not be considered to be satisfied unless essentially 100 percent coverage is achieved.

(*5*) All hot-leg operating temperature welds in Inspection Items G, H, J, and K must be inspected each inspection interval. A 25 percent sample of Inspection Items G, H, J, and K cold-leg operating temperature welds must be inspected whenever the core barrel is removed (unless it has already been inspected within the past 10 years) or 20 years, whichever is less.

(*6*) For any mitigated weld whose volumetric examination detects growth of existing flaws in the required examination volume that exceed the previous IWB-3600 flaw evaluations or new flaws, a report summarizing the evaluation, along with inputs, methodologies, assumptions, and causes of the new flaw or flaw growth is to be provided to the NRC prior to the weld being placed in service other than modes 5 or 6.

(*7*) For Inspection Items G, H, J, and K, when applying the acceptance standards of ASME BPV Code, Section XI, IWB-3514, for planar flaws contained within the inlay or onlay, the thickness “t” in IWB-3514 is the thickness of the inlay or onlay. For planar flaws in the balance of the dissimilar metal weld examination volume, the thickness “t” in IWB-3514 is the combined thickness of the inlay or onlay and the dissimilar metal weld.

(*8*) Welds mitigated by optimized weld overlays in Inspection Items D and E are not permitted to be placed into a population to be examined on a sample basis and must be examined once each inspection interval.

(*9*) Replace the first two sentences of Extent and Frequency of Examination for Inspection Item D in Table 1 of Code Case N-770-1 with, “Examine all welds no sooner than the third refueling outage and no later than 10 years following stress improvement application.” Replace the first two sentences of Note (11)(b)(2) in Code Case N-770-1 with, “The first examination following weld inlay, onlay, weld overlay, or stress improvement for Inspection Items D through K must be performed as specified.”

(*10*) General Note (b) to Figure 5(a) of Code Case N-770-1 pertaining to alternative examination volume for optimized weld overlays may not be applied unless NRC approval is authorized under paragraphs (z)(1) or (2) of this section.
