(b) The NRC will search for agency records requested under ยง 9.23(b) without charges for the first two hours of search for any request not sought for commercial use and not covered in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The NRC will duplicate agency records requested under ยง 9.23(b) without charge for the first 100 pages of standard paper copies, or the equivalent cost of 100 pages of standard paper copies when providing the requester copies in microfiche or electronic form such as computer disks, if the requester is not a commercial use requester.

(d) The NRC may not bill any requester for fees if the cost of collecting the fee would be equal to or greater than the fee itself.

(e) The NRC may aggregate requests in determining search and duplication to be provided without charge as provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if the NRC finds a requester or group of requesters acting in concert, has filed multiple requests that actually constitute a single request, and that the requests involve clearly-related matters.
