(1) A Government agency or a Federally recognized Indian Tribe licensee who possesses and uses accelerator-produced radioactive material or discrete sources of radium-226 may continue to use such material for medical uses permitted under this part until the date of the NRC's final licensing determination, provided that the licensee submits an amendment application on or before June 2, 2008.

(2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, all other licensees who possess and use accelerator-produced radioactive material or discrete sources of radium-226 may continue to use those materials for medical uses permitted under this part until the date of the NRC's final licensing determination, provided that the person submits a medical use license amendment request within 6 months from the waiver expiration date of August 7, 2009 or within 6 months from the date of an earlier termination of the waiver as noticed by the NRC, whichever date is earlier.

(b) Before it permits anyone to work as an authorized user, authorized nuclear pharmacist, or authorized medical physicist under the license, except -

(1) For an authorized user, an individual who meets the requirements in §§ 35.59 and 35.190(a), 35.290(a), 35.390(a), 35.392(a), 35.394(a), 35.490(a), 35.590(a), and 35.690(a);

(3) For an authorized medical physicist, an individual who meets the requirements in §§ 35.51(a) and (c) and 35.59;

(4) An individual who is identified as an authorized user, an authorized nuclear pharmacist, or authorized medical physicist -

(i) On a Commission or Agreement State license or other equivalent permit or license recognized by NRC that authorizes the use of byproduct material in medical use or in the practice of nuclear pharmacy;

(ii) On a permit issued by a Commission or Agreement State specific license of broad scope that is authorized to permit the use of byproduct material in medical use or in the practice of nuclear pharmacy;

(iii) On a permit issued by a Commission master material licensee that is authorized to permit the use of byproduct material in medical use or in the practice of nuclear pharmacy; or

(iv) By a commercial nuclear pharmacy that has been authorized to identify authorized nuclear pharmacists.

(5) A physician, podiatrist, or dentist who used only accelerator-produced radioactive materials, discrete sources of radium-226, or both, for medical uses or a nuclear pharmacist who used only accelerator-produced radioactive materials in the practice of nuclear pharmacy at a Government agency or Federally recognized Indian Tribe before November 30, 2007 or at all other locations of use before August 8, 2009, or an earlier date as noticed by the NRC, and for only those materials and uses performed before these dates.
