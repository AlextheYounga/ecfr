##### § 1003.55 OHA evaluation. #####

(a)(1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any application for modification or rescission provided that the applicant is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating an application for modification or rescission, the OHA may convene a conference, on its own initiative, if, in its discretion, it considers that such conference will advance its evaluation of the application.

(2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request the necessary additional information is not submitted, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice. If the applicant fails to provide the notice required by § 1003.53, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice.

(b)(1) An application for modification or rescission of an order shall be processed only if -

(i) The application demonstrates that it is based on significantly changed circumstances; and

(ii) The period within which a person may file an appeal has lapsed or, if an appeal has been filed, a final order has been issued.

(2) For purposes of this subpart, the term “significantly changed circumstances” shall mean -

(i) The discovery of material facts that were not known or could not have been known at the time of the proceeding and action upon which the application is based;

(ii) The discovery of a law, rule, regulation, order or decision on appeal or exception that was in effect at the time of the proceeding upon which the application is based and which, if such had been made known to the OHA, would have been relevant to the proceeding and would have substantially altered the outcome; or

(iii) There has been a substantial change in the facts or circumstances upon which an outstanding and continuing order of the OHA affecting the applicant was issued, which change has occurred during the interval between issuance of such order and the date of the application and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control of the applicant.
