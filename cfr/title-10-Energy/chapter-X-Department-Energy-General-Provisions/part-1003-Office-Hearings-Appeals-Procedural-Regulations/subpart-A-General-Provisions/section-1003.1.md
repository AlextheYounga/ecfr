##### ยง 1003.1 Purpose and scope. #####

This part establishes the procedures to be utilized and identifies the sanctions that are available in most proceedings before the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. These procedures provide standard rules of practice in a variety of informal adjudications when jurisdiction is vested in the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Any or all of the procedures contained in this part may be incorporated by reference in another DOE rule or regulation which invokes the adjudicatory authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The procedures may also be made applicable at the direction of an appropriate DOE official if incorporated by reference in the delegation. These rules do not apply in instances in which DOE regulations themselves contain procedures governing OHA proceedings conducted under authority of those particular regulations. (E.g., 10 CFR part 708-DOE Contractor Employee Protection Program; 10 CFR part 710-Criteria and Procedures for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Matter or Special Nuclear Material.) These rules also do not apply to matters before the DOE Board of Contract Appeals or other procurement and financial assistance appeals boards, which are covered by their own rules.
