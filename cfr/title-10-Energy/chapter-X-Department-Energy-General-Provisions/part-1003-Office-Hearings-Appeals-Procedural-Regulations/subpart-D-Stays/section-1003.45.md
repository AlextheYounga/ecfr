##### ยง 1003.45 OHA evaluation. #####

(a)(1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in an application and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may order the submission of additional information, and may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to an application provided that the applicant is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating an application, the OHA may also consider any other source of information, and may conduct hearings or conferences either in response to requests by parties in the proceeding or on its own initiative.

(2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if upon request additional information is not submitted by the applicant, the OHA may dismiss the application without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the application with prejudice.

(3) The OHA shall process applications for stay as expeditiously as possible. When administratively feasible, the OHA shall grant or deny an Application for Stay within 10 business days after receipt of the application.

(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of the DOE regulations, the OHA may make a decision on any Application for Stay prior to the receipt of written comments.

(b) The criteria to be considered and weighed by the OHA in determining whether a stay should be granted are:

(1) Whether a showing has been made that an irreparable injury will result in the event that the stay is denied;

(2) Whether a showing has been made that a denial of the stay will result in a more immediate hardship or inequity to the applicant than a grant of the stay would cause to other persons affected by the proceeding;

(3) Whether a showing has been made that it would be desirable for public policy reasons to grant immediate relief pending a decision by OHA on the merits;

(4) Whether a showing has been made that it is impossible for the applicant to fulfill the requirements of an outstanding order or regulatory provision; and

(5) Whether a showing has been made that there is a strong likelihood of success on the merits.
