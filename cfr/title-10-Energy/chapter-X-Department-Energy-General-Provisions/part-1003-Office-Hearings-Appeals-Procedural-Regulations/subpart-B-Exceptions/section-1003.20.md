##### ยง 1003.20 Purpose and scope. #####

(a) This subpart establishes the procedures for applying for an exception or exemption, as provided for in section 504 (42 U.S.C. 7194) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 *et seq.*), from a rule, regulation or DOE action having the effect of a rule as defined by 5 U.S.C. 551(4), based on an assertion of serious hardship, gross inequity or unfair distribution of burdens, and for consideration of such application by the OHA. The procedures contained in this subpart may be incorporated by reference in another DOE rule or regulation which invokes the adjudicatory authority of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. The procedures may also be made applicable to proceedings undertaken at the direction of an appropriate DOE official if incorporated by reference in the delegation.

(b) The filing of an application for an exception shall not constitute grounds for noncompliance with the requirements from which an exception is sought, unless a stay has been issued in accordance with subpart D of this part.
