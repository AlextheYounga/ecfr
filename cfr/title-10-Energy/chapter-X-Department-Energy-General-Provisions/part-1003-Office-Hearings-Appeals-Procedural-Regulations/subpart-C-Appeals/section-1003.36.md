##### ยง 1003.36 OHA evaluation. #####

(a)(1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in an appeal and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any appeal provided that the appellant is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating an appeal, the OHA may consider any other source of information. The OHA on its own initiative may convene a conference or hearing if, in its discretion, it considers that such conference or hearing will advance its evaluation of the appeal.

(2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if, upon request, the necessary additional information is not submitted, the OHA may dismiss the appeal with leave to refile within a specified time. If the failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the appeal with prejudice. If the appellant fails to provide the notice required by ยง 1003.34, the OHA may dismiss the appeal without prejudice.

(1) The appeal was filed by a person aggrieved by a DOE action;

(2) The DOE's action was erroneous in fact or in law; or
