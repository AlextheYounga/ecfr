##### § 1003.35 Contents. #####

(a) The appeal shall contain a concise statement of grounds upon which it is brought and a description of the relief sought. It shall include a discussion of all relevant authorities, including, but not limited to, DOE rules, regulations, and decisions on appeals and exceptions relied upon to support the appeal. If the appeal includes a request for relief based on significantly changed circumstances, there shall be a complete description of the events, acts, or transactions that comprise the significantly changed circumstances, and the appellant shall state why, if the significantly changed circumstance is new or newly discovered facts, such facts were not or could not have been presented during the process that led to the issuance of the order from which the appeal has been taken. For purposes of this subpart, the term “significantly changed circumstances” shall mean -

(1) The discovery of material facts that were not known or could not have been known at the time of the process that led to the issuance of the order from which the appeal has been taken;

(2) The discovery of a law, rule, regulation, order or decision on an appeal or any exception that was in effect at the time of the process that led to the issuance of the order from which the appeal has been taken, and which, if such had been made known to DOE, would have been relevant and would have substantially altered the outcome; or

(3) A substantial change in the facts or circumstances upon which an outstanding and continuing order affecting the appellant was issued, which change has occurred during the interval between issuance of the order and the date of the appeal and was caused by forces or circumstances beyond the control of the appellant.

(b) A copy of the order that is the subject of the appeal shall be submitted with the appeal.

(c) The appellant shall state whether he requests or intends to request that there be a conference or hearing regarding the appeal. Any request not made at the time the appeal is filed shall be made as soon thereafter as possible. The request and the OHA determination on the request shall be made in accordance with subpart F of this part.
