##### § 1003.30 Purpose and scope. #####

This subpart establishes the procedures for the filing of an administrative appeal of a DOE order and for the consideration of the appeal by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Unless a program rule or regulation or a DOE delegation of authority provides otherwise, a person aggrieved by a DOE order appealable under this subpart has not exhausted his or her administrative remedies until an appeal has been filed under this subpart and an order granting or denying the appeal has been issued. A person filing an appeal must also file an “Application for Stay” under subpart D of this part if the grant of a stay is necessary under Section 10(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 704) to preclude judicial review pending final action on the appeal.
