##### § 1003.76 OHA evaluation of request. #####

(a)(1) The OHA may initiate an investigation of any statement in a petition and utilize in its evaluation any relevant facts obtained by such investigation. The OHA may solicit and accept submissions from third persons relevant to any petition provided that the petitioner is afforded an opportunity to respond to all third person submissions. In evaluating a petition, the OHA may consider any other source of information. The OHA on its own initiative may convene a conference, if, in its discretion, it considers that such will advance its evaluation of the petition.

(2) If the OHA determines that there is insufficient information upon which to base a decision and if, upon request, the necessary additional information is not submitted, the OHA may dismiss the petition without prejudice. If the failure to supply additional information is repeated or willful, the OHA may dismiss the petition with prejudice. If the petitioner fails to provide the notice required by § 1003.74, the OHA may dismiss the petition without prejudice.

(b)(1) The OHA will dismiss without prejudice a “Petition for Special Redress or Other Relief” if it determines that another more appropriate proceeding is provided by this part.

(2) The OHA will dismiss with prejudice a “Petition for Special Redress or Other Relief” filed by a person who has exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to any proceeding provided by this part, and received a final order therefrom that addresses the same issue or transaction.
