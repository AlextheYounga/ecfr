##### ยง 1045.41 Use of classified addendums. #####

(a) In order to maximize the amount of information available to the public and to simplify document handling procedures, document originators should segregate RD or FRD into an addendum whenever practical. When RD or FRD is segregated into an addendum, the originator shall acknowledge the existence of the classified addendum unless such an acknowledgment would reveal classified information.

(b) When segregation of RD or FRD into an addendum is not practical, document originators are encouraged to prepare separate unclassified versions of documents with significant public interest.

(c) When documents contain environmental, safety or health information and a separate unclassified version cannot be prepared, document originators are encouraged to provide a publicly releasable rationale for the classification of the documents.
