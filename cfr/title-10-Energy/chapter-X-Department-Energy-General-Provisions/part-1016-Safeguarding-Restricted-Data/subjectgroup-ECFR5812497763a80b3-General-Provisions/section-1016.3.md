(a) *Access authorization or security clearance.* An administrative determination by the DOE that an individual who is either a DOE employee, applicant for employment, consultant, assignee, other Federal department or agency employee (and other persons who may be designated by the Secretary of Energy), or a DOE contractor or subcontractor employee and an access permittee is eligible for access to Restricted Data. Access authorizations or security clearances granted by DOE are designated as “Q,” “Q(X),” “L,” “L(X),” “Top Secret,” or “Secret.” For the purpose of this chapter only “Q,” “Q(X),” “L,” and “L(X)” access authorizations or clearances will be defined.

(1) “Q” access authorizations or clearances are based upon full field investigations conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Office of Personnel Management, or another Government agency which conducts personnel security investigations. They permit an individual to have access, on a “need to know” basis, to Top Secret, Secret, and Confidential Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, National Security Information, or special nuclear material in Category I or II quantities as required in the performance of duties.

(2) “Q(X)” access authorizations or clearances are based upon the same full field investigations as described in § 1016.3(a)(1), above. When “Q” access authorizations or clearances are granted to access permittees they are identified as “Q(X)” access authorizations or clearances and authorize access only to the type of Secret Restricted Data as specified in the permit and consistent with appendix A, 10 CFR part 725, “Categories of Restricted Data Available.”

(3) “L” access authorizations or clearances are based upon National Agency Checks and Inquiries (NACI) for Federal employees, or National Agency Checks (NAC) for non-Federal employees, conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. They permit an individual to have access, on a “need to know” basis, to Confidential Restricted Data, Secret and Confidential Formerly Restricted Data, or Secret and Confidential National Security Information, required in the performance of duties, provided such information is not designated “CRYPTO” (classified cryptographic information), other classified communications security (“COMSEC”) information, or intelligence information.

(4) “L(X)” access authorizations or clearances are based upon the same National Agency Checks as described in paragraph (a)(3), of this section. When “L” access authorizations or clearances are granted to access permittees, they are identified as “L(X)” access authorizations or clearances and authorize access only to the type of Confidential Retricted Data as specified in the permit and consistent with appendix A, 10 CFR part 725, “Categories of Restricted Data Available.”
