##### § 1016.32 Classification and preparation of documents. #####

(a) *Classification.* Restricted Data generated or possessed by an Access Permit holder must be appropriately marked. CG-UF-3, “Guide to the Unclassified Fields of Research,” will be furnished each permittee. In the event a permittee originates classified information which falls within the definition of Restricted Data or information which he is not positive is not within that definition and CG-UF-3 does not provide positive classification guidance for such information, he shall designate the information as Confidential, Restricted Data and request classification guidance from the DOE through the Classification Officer at the cognizant DOE or NNSA office, who will refer the request to the Director, Office of Classification, HS-90/Germantown Building, Office of Health, Safety and Security, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585-1290 if he does not have authority to provide the guidance.

(b) *Classification consistent with content.* Each document containing Restricted Data shall be classified Secret or Confidential according to its own content.

(c) *Document which custodian believes improperly classified or lacking appropriate classification markings.* If a person receives a document which, in his opinion, is not properly classified, or omits the appropriate classification markings, he shall communicate with the sender and suggest the classification which he believes appropriate. Pending final determination of proper classification, such documents shall be safeguarded with the highest classification in question.

(d) *Classification markings.* Unless otherwise authorized below, the assigned classification of a document shall be conspicuously marked or stamped at the top and bottom of each page and on the front cover, if any, and the document shall bear the following additional markings on the first page and on the front cover:

(2) The series designation shall be a capital letter beginning with the letter “A” designating the original set of copies prepared. Each subsequent set of copies of the same documents shall be identified by the succeeding letter of the alphabet.

(f) *Letter of transmittal.* A letter of transmitting Restricted Data shall be marked with a classification at least as high as its highest classified enclosure.

The additional markings referred to in paragraph (d) of this section shall be placed on the first page and on the front cover.

(h) *Physically connected documents.* The classification of a file or group of physically connected documents shall be at least as high as that of the most highly classified document therein. It shall bear only one overall classification, although pages, paragraphs, sections, or components thereof may bear different classifications. Each document separated from the file or group shall be handled in accordance with its individual classification.
