##### § 433.201 Scope 1 Fossil fuel-generated energy consumption determination. #####

(a) The fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of a proposed building is calculated as follows:

Equation 2: Fossil fuel-generated energy consumption = Direct Scope 1 Fossil Fuel-Generated Consumption of Proposed Building/Floor AreaWhere:*Direct Scope 1 Fossil Fuel-Generated Energy Consumption of Proposed Building* equals the total Scope 1 fossil fuel-generated energy consumption of the proposed building calculated in accordance with the method required in § 433.101(a)(5) and measured in thousands of British thermal units per year (kBtu/yr), except that this term does not include fossil fuel consumption for emergency electricity generation. Agencies must include all on-site fossil fuel use or Scope 1 emissions associated with non-emergency generation from backup generators (such as those for peak shaving or peak shifting). Any energy generation or Scope 1 emissions associated with biomass fuels are excluded. Any emissions associated with natural gas for alternatively fueled vehicles (“AFVs”) (or any other alternative fuel defined at 42 U.S.C. 13211 that is provided at a Federal building) is excluded. For buildings with manufacturing or industrial process loads, the process loads should be accounted for in the analysis for the building's fossil fuel consumption and GHG emissions, but are not subject to the phase down targets.*Floor Area* is the area enclosed by the exterior walls of a building, both finished and unfinished, including indoor parking facilities, basements, hallways, lobbies, stairways, and elevator shafts.
