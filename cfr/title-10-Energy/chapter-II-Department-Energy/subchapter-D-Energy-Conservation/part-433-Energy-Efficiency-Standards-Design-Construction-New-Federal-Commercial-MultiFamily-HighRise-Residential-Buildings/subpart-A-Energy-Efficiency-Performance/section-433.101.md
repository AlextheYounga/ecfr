##### § 433.101 Performance level determination. #####

(a)(1) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after January 3, 2007, but before August 10, 2012, each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2004 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2004 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3), except the formula for calculating the Performance Rating in paragraph G1.2 shall read as follows:

(i) Percentage improvement = 100 × ((Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads) - (Proposed building consumption - Receptacle and process loads))/(Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads) (which simplifies as follows):

(ii) Percentage improvement = 100 × (Baseline building consumption - Proposed building consumption)/(Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads).

(2) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after August 10, 2012, but before July 9, 2014, each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2007 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2007 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3), except the formula for calculating the Performance Rating in paragraph G1.2 shall read as follows:

(i) Percentage improvement = 100 × ((Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads) - (Proposed building consumption - Receptacle and process loads))/(Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads) (which simplifies as follows):

(ii) Percentage improvement = 100 × (Baseline building consumption - Proposed building consumption)/(Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads).

(3) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after July 9, 2014, but before November 6, 2016 each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2010 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3), except the formula for calculating the Performance Rating in paragraph G1.2 shall read as follows:

(i) Percentage improvement = 100 × ((Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads) - (Proposed building consumption - Receptacle and process loads))/(Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads) (which simplifies as follows):

(ii) Percentage improvement = 100 × (Baseline building consumption - Proposed building consumption)/(Baseline building consumption - Receptacle and process loads).

(4) For Federal buildings for which design for construction began on or after before November 6, 2016 each Federal agency shall determine energy consumption levels for both the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2013 and proposed building by using the Performance Rating Method found in Appendix G of ASHRAE 90.1-2013 (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3), except the formula for calculating the Performance Rating in paragraph G1.2 shall read as follows:

(i) Percentage improvement = 100 × ((Baseline building consumption − Receptacle and process loads)− (Proposed building consumption − Receptacle and process loads))/(Baseline building consumption − Receptacle and process loads) (which simplifies as follows):

(ii) Percentage improvement = 100 × (Baseline building consumption − Proposed building consumption)/(Baseline building consumption − Receptacle and process loads).

(b) Energy consumption for the purposes of calculating the 30 percent savings requirements in § 433.100 shall include the building envelope and energy consuming systems normally specified as part of the building design by ASHRAE 90.1 such as space heating, space cooling, ventilation, service water heating, and lighting, but shall not include receptacle and process loads not within the scope of ASHRAE 90.1 such as specialized medical or research equipment and equipment used in manufacturing processes.
