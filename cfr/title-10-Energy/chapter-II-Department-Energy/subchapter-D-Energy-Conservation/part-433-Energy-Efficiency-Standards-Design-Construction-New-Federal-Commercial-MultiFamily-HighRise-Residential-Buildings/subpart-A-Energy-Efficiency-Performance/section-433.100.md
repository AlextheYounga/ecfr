Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 20294, Apr. 7, 2022.

(a) (1) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after January 3, 2007, but before August 10, 2012, to:

(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2004, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and

(ii) If life-cycle cost-effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2004.

(2) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after August 10, 2012, but before July 9, 2014, to:

(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2007, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and

(ii) If life-cycle cost-effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2007.

(3) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after July 9, 2014, but before November 6, 2016 to:

(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2010, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and

(ii) If life-cycle cost-effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2010.

(4) All Federal agencies shall design new Federal buildings that are commercial and multi-family high-rise residential buildings, for which design for construction began on or after November 6, 2016 to:

(i) Meet ASHRAE 90.1-2013, (incorporated by reference, see § 433.3); and

(ii) If life-cycle cost-effective, achieve energy consumption levels, calculated consistent with paragraph (b) of this section, that are at least 30 percent below the levels of the ASHRAE Baseline Building 2013.

(b) Energy consumption for the purposes of calculating the 30 percent savings requirements shall include the building envelope and energy consuming systems normally specified as part of the building design by ASHRAE 90.1 such as space heating, space cooling, ventilation, service water heating, and lighting, but shall not include receptacle and process loads not within the scope of ASHRAE 90.1 such as specialized medical or research equipment and equipment used in manufacturing processes.

(c) If a 30 percent reduction is not life-cycle cost-effective, the design of the proposed building shall be modified so as to achieve an energy consumption level at or better than the maximum level of energy efficiency that is life-cycle cost-effective, but at a minimum complies with paragraph (a) of this section.
