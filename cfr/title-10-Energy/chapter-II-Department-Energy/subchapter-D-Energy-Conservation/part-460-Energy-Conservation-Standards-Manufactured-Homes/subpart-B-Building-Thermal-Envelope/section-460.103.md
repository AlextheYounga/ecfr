|   Access hatches, panels, and doors   |Access hatches, panels, and doors between conditioned space and unconditioned space, such as attics and crawlspaces, must be insulated to a level equivalent to the insulation of the surrounding surface, must provide access to all equipment that prevents damaging or compressing the insulation, and must provide a wood-framed or equivalent baffle or retainer when loose fill insulation is installed within an exterior ceiling assembly to retain the insulation both on the access hatch, panel, or door and within the building thermal envelope.|

Baffles, when used in conjunction with eave venting, must be constructed using a solid material, maintain an opening equal or greater than the size of the vents, and extend over the top of the attic insulation.                                                                                                               |
