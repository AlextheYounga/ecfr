(b) *Prescriptive requirements.* (1) The building thermal envelope must meet the applicable minimum *R-*value (nominal value of insulation), and the glazing maximum *U-*factor and SHGC, requirements set forth in table 1 to § 460.102(b)(1) and table 2 to § 460.102(b)(2) or component U-values set forth in table 3 to § 460.102(b)(5) and table 4 to § 460.102(b)(5).

(2) For the purpose of compliance with the exterior ceiling insulation *R-*value requirement of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the truss heel height must be a minimum of 5.5 inches at the outside face of each exterior wall.

(3) A combination of *R-*21 batt insulation and *R-*14 blanket insulation may be used for the purpose of compliance with the floor insulation *R-*value requirement of table 2 to § 460.102(b)(1), Climate Zone 3.

(4) An individual skylight that has an SHGC that is less than or equal to 0.30 is not subject to the glazed fenestration SHGC requirements established in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Adapted from section R402 of the 2021 IECC.

(5) *U-*factor alternatives to *R-*value requirements. Compliance with the applicable requirements in paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be determined using the applicable maximum *U-*factor values set forth in table 3 to § 460.102(b)(5) and table 4 to § 460.102(b)(5), which reflect the thermal transmittance of the component, excluding fenestration, and not just the insulation of that component, as an alternative to the minimum nominal *R-*value requirements set forth in table 1 to § 460.102(b)(1) and table 2 to § 460.102(b)(1), respectively.
