(a) *Scope.* Pursuant to section 346(b)(1) of EPCA, this section provides the test procedures for measuring, pursuant to EPCA, the efficiency of small electric motors pursuant to EPCA. (42 U.S.C. 6317(b)(1)) For purposes of this part 431 and EPCA, the test procedures for measuring the efficiency of small electric motors shall be the test procedures specified in § 431.444(b).

(b) *Testing and Calculations.* Determine the energy efficiency and losses by using one of the following test methods:

(1) Single-phase small electric motors: Either IEEE Std 114-2010 or CSA C747 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.443);

(2) Polyphase small electric motors less than or equal to 1 horsepower (0.75 kW): Either IEEE Std 112-2004 Test Method A or CSA C747 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.443); or

(3) Polyphase small electric motors greater than 1 horsepower (0.75 kW): Either IEEE Std 112-2004 Test Method B or CSA C390-10 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.443).
