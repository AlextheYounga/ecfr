Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 23, Jan. 4, 2021.This amendment was delayed until Mar. 21, 2021, at 86 FR 7798, Feb. 2, 2021.

The following definitions are applicable to this subpart:

*Alternative efficiency determination method,* or AEDM, means, with respect to a small electric motor, a method of calculating the total power loss and average full-load efficiency.

*Average full-load efficiency* means the arithmetic mean of the full-load efficiencies of a population of small electric motors of duplicate design, where the full-load efficiency of each motor in the population is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the motor's useful power output to its total power input when the motor is operated at its full rated load, rated voltage, and rated frequency.

*Basic model* means, with respect to a small electric motor, all units of a given type of small electric motor (or class thereof) manufactured by a single manufacturer, and which have the same rating, have electrical characteristics that are essentially identical, and do not have any differing physical or functional characteristics that affect energy consumption or efficiency. For the purpose of this definition, “rating” means a combination of the small electric motor's group (i.e., capacitor-start, capacitor-run; capacitor-start, induction-run; or polyphase), horsepower rating (or standard kilowatt equivalent), and number of poles with respect to which § 431.446 prescribes nominal full load efficiency standards.

*CSA* means Canadian Standards Association.

*DOE* or *the Department* means the U.S. Department of Energy.

*EPCA* means the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6291-6317.

*IEC* means International Electrotechnical Commission.

*IEEE* means Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

*NEMA* means National Electrical Manufacturers Association.

*Small electric motor* means a NEMA general purpose alternating current single-speed induction motor, built in a two-digit frame number series in accordance with NEMA Standards Publication MG1-1987, including IEC metric equivalent motors.
