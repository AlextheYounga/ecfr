##### § 431.192 Definitions. #####

The following definitions apply for purposes of this subpart:

*Autotransformer* means a transformer that:

(1) Has one physical winding that consists of a series winding part and a common winding part;

(2) Has no isolation between its primary and secondary circuits; and

(3) During step-down operation, has a primary voltage that is equal to the total of the series and common winding voltages, and a secondary voltage that is equal to the common winding voltage.

*Auxiliary device* means a localized component of a distribution transformer that is a circuit breaker, switch, fuse, or surge/lightning arrester.

*Basic model* means a group of models of distribution transformers manufactured by a single manufacturer, that have the same insulation type (*i.e.,* liquid-immersed or dry-type), have the same number of phases (*i.e.,* single or three), have the same standard kVA rating, and do not have any differentiating electrical, physical or functional features that affect energy consumption. Differences in voltage and differences in basic impulse insulation level (BIL) rating are examples of differentiating electrical features that affect energy consumption.

(2) Has an output voltage of 600 V or less;

(3) Is rated for operation at a frequency of 60 Hz; and

(4) Has a capacity of 10 kVA to 2500 kVA for liquid-immersed units and 15 kVA to 2500 kVA for dry-type units; but

*Efficiency* means the ratio of the useful power output to the total power input.

*Excitation current* or *no-load current* means the current that flows in any winding used to excite the transformer when all other windings are open-circuited.

*Grounding transformer* means a three-phase transformer intended primarily to provide a neutral point for system-grounding purposes, either by means of:

(1) A grounded wye primary winding and a delta secondary winding; or

(2) A transformer with its primary winding in a zig-zag winding arrangement, and with no secondary winding.

*Liquid-immersed distribution transformer* means a distribution transformer in which the core and coil assembly is immersed in an insulating liquid.

*Load loss* means, for a distribution transformer, those losses incident to a specified load carried by the transformer, including losses in the windings as well as stray losses in the conducting parts of the transformer.

*Low-voltage dry-type distribution transformer* means a distribution transformer that has an input voltage of 600 volts or less and has the core and coil assembly immersed in a gaseous or dry-compound insulating medium.

*Machine-tool (control) transformer* means a transformer that is equipped with a fuse or other over-current protection device, and is generally used for the operation of a solenoid, contactor, relay, portable tool, or localized lighting.

*No-load loss* means those losses that are incident to the excitation of the transformer.

*Nonventilated transformer* means a transformer constructed so as to prevent external air circulation through the coils of the transformer while operating at zero gauge pressure.

*Per-unit load* means the fraction of rated load.

*Phase angle* means the angle between two phasors, where the two phasors represent progressions of periodic waves of either:

(1) Two voltages;

(2) Two currents; or

(3) A voltage and a current of an alternating current circuit.

*Phase angle correction* means the adjustment (correction) of measurement data to negate the effects of phase angle error.

*Phase angle error* means incorrect displacement of the phase angle, introduced by the components of the test equipment.

*Rectifier transformer* means a transformer that operates at the fundamental frequency of an alternating-current system and that is designed to have one or more output windings connected to a rectifier.

*Reference temperature* means the temperature at which the transformer losses are determined, and to which such losses are corrected if testing is done at a different point. (Reference temperature values are specified in the test method in appendix A to this subpart.)
