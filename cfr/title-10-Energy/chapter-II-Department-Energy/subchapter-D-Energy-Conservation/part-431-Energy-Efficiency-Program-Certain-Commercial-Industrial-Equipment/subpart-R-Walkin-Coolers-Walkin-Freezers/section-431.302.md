##### ยง 431.302 Definitions concerning walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 95801, Dec. 28, 2016.This amendment was delayed until Mar. 21, 2017, at 82 FR 8805, Jan. 31, 2017.

*Basic model* means all components of a given type of walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer (or class thereof) manufactured by one manufacturer, having the same primary energy source, and which have essentially identical electrical, physical, and functional (or hydraulic) characteristics that affect energy consumption, energy efficiency, water consumption, or water efficiency; and

(1) With respect to panels, which do not have any differing features or characteristics that affect U-factor.

(2) [Reserved]

*Display door* means a door that:

(1) Is designed for product display; or

(2) Has 75 percent or more of its surface area composed of glass or another transparent material.

*Display panel* means a panel that is entirely or partially comprised of glass, a transparent material, or both and is used for display purposes.

*Door* means an assembly installed in an opening on an interior or exterior wall that is used to allow access or close off the opening and that is movable in a sliding, pivoting, hinged, or revolving manner of movement. For walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers, a door includes the door panel, glass, framing materials, door plug, mullion, and any other elements that form the door or part of its connection to the wall.

*Envelope* means -

(1) The portion of a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer that isolates the interior, refrigerated environment from the ambient, external environment; and

(2) All energy-consuming components of the walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer that are not part of its refrigeration system.

*Freight door* means a door that is not a display door and is equal to or larger than 4 feet wide and 8 feet tall.

*K-factor* means the thermal conductivity of a material.

*Manufacturer of a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer* means any person who:

(1) Manufactures a component of a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer that affects energy consumption, including, but not limited to, refrigeration, doors, lights, windows, or walls; or

(2) Manufactures or assembles the complete walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer.

*Panel* means a construction component that is not a door and is used to construct the envelope of the walk-in, i.e., elements that separate the interior refrigerated environment of the walk-in from the exterior.

*Passage door* means a door that is not a freight or display door.

*Refrigerated* means held at a temperature at or below 55 degrees Fahrenheit using a refrigeration system.

*Refrigeration system* means the mechanism (including all controls and other components integral to the system's operation) used to create the refrigerated environment in the interior of a walk-in cooler or freezer, consisting of:

(1) A packaged dedicated system where the unit cooler and condensing unit are integrated into a single piece of equipment; or

(2) A split dedicated system with separate unit cooler and condensing unit sections; or

(3) A unit cooler that is connected to a multiplex condensing system.

*U-factor* means the heat transmission in a unit time through a unit area of a specimen or product and its boundary air films, induced by a unit temperature difference between the environments on each side.

*Walk-in cooler and walk-in freezer* mean an enclosed storage space refrigerated to temperatures, respectively, above, and at or below 32 degrees Fahrenheit that can be walked into, and has a total chilled storage area of less than 3,000 square feet; however the terms do not include products designed and marketed exclusively for medical, scientific, or research purposes.
