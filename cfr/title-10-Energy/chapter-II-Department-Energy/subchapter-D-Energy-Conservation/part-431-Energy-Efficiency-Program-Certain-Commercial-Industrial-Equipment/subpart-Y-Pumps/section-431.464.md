##### § 431.464 Test procedure for the measurement of energy efficiency, energy consumption, and other performance factors of pumps. #####

(a) *General pumps* - (1) *Scope.* This paragraph (a) provides the test procedures for determining the constant and variable load pump energy index for:

(i) The following categories of clean water pumps:

(A) End suction close-coupled (ESCC);

(B) End suction frame mounted/own bearings (ESFM);

(C) In-line (IL);

(D) Radially split, multi-stage, vertical, in-line casing diffuser (RSV); and

(E) Submersible turbine (ST) pumps.

(ii) With the following characteristics:

(A) Flow rate of 25 gpm or greater at BEP and full impeller diameter;

(B) Maximum head of 459 feet at BEP and full impeller diameter and the number of stages required for testing (see section 1.2.2 of appendix A of this subpart);

(C) Design temperature range from 14 to 248 °F;

(D) Designed to operate with either:

(*1*) A 2- or 4-pole induction motor; or

(*2*) A non-induction motor with a speed of rotation operating range that includes speeds of rotation between 2,880 and 4,320 revolutions per minute (rpm) and/or 1,440 and 2,160 rpm, and in either case, the driver and impeller must rotate at the same speed;

(E) For ST pumps, a 6-inch or smaller bowl diameter; and

(F) For ESCC and ESFM pumps, a specific speed less than or equal to 5,000 when calculated using U.S. customary units.

(iii) Except for the following pumps:

(A) Fire pumps;

(B) Self-priming pumps;

(C) Prime-assist pumps;

(D) Magnet driven pumps;

(E) Pumps designed to be used in a nuclear facility subject to 10 CFR part 50, “Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities”; and

(F) Pumps meeting the design and construction requirements set forth in Military Specifications: MIL-P-17639F, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Miscellaneous Service, Naval Shipboard Use” (as amended); MIL-P-17881D, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Boiler Feed, (Multi-Stage)” (as amended); MIL-P-17840C, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Close-Coupled, Navy Standard (For Surface Ship Application)” (as amended); MIL-P-18682D, “Pump, Centrifugal, Main Condenser Circulating, Naval Shipboard” (as amended); and MIL-P-18472G, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Condensate, Feed Booster, Waste Heat Boiler, And Distilling Plant” (as amended). Military specifications and standards are available for review at *http://everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS*.

(2) *Testing and calculations.* Determine the applicable constant load pump energy index (PEICL) or variable load pump energy index (PEIVL) using the test procedure set forth in appendix A of this subpart.

(b) *Dedicated-purpose pool pumps* - (1) *Scope.* This paragraph (b) provides the test procedures for determining the weighted energy factor (WEF), rated hydraulic horsepower, dedicated-purpose pool pump nominal motor horsepower, dedicated-purpose pool pump motor total horsepower, dedicated-purpose pool pump service factor, and other pump performance parameters for:

(i) The following varieties of dedicated-purpose pool pumps:

(A) Self-priming pool filter pumps;

(B) Non-self-priming pool filter pumps;

(C) Waterfall pumps; and

(D) Pressure cleaner booster pumps;

(ii) Served by single-phase or polyphase input power;

(iii) Except for:

(A) Submersible pumps; and

(B) Self-priming and non-self-priming pool filter pumps with hydraulic output power greater than or equal to 2.5 horsepower.

(2) *Testing and calculations.* Determine the weighted energy factor (WEF) using the test procedure set forth in appendix B or appendix C of this subpart, as applicable.
