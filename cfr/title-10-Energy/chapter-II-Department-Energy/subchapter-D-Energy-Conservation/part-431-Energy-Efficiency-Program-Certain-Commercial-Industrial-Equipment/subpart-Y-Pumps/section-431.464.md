##### § 431.464 Test procedure for measuring and determining energy consumption of pumps. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 36923, Aug. 7, 2017.

(a) *Scope.* This section provides the test procedures for determining the constant and variable load pump energy index for:

(1) The following categories of clean water pumps:

(i) End suction close-coupled (ESCC);

(ii) End suction frame mounted/own bearings (ESFM);

(iii) In-line (IL);

(iv) Radially split, multi-stage, vertical, in-line casing diffuser (RSV); and

(v) Submersible turbine (ST) pumps

(2) With the following characteristics:

(i) Flow rate of 25 gpm or greater at BEP and full impeller diameter;

(ii) Maximum head of 459 feet at BEP and full impeller diameter and the number of stages required for testing (see section 1.2.2 of appendix A of this subpart);

(iii) Design temperature range from 14 to 248 °F;

(iv) Designed to operate with either: (*1*) a 2- or 4-pole induction motor, or (*2*) a non-induction motor with a speed of rotation operating range that includes speeds of rotation between 2,880 and 4,320 revolutions per minute and/or 1,440 and 2,160 revolutions per minute, and in either case, the driver and impeller must rotate at the same speed;

(v) For ST pumps, a 6-inch or smaller bowl diameter; and

(vi) For ESCC and ESFM pumps, a specific speed less than or equal to 5000 when calculated using U.S. customary units.

(3) Except for the following pumps:

(i) Fire pumps;

(ii) Self-priming pumps;

(iii) Prime-assist pumps;

(iv) Magnet driven pumps;

(v) Pumps designed to be used in a nuclear facility subject to 10 CFR part 50, “Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities;” and

(vi) Pumps meeting the design and construction requirements set forth in Military Specifications: MIL-P-17639F, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Miscellaneous Service, Naval Shipboard Use” (as amended); MIL-P-17881D, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Boiler Feed, (Multi-Stage)” (as amended); MIL-P-17840C, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Close-Coupled, Navy Standard (For Surface Ship Application)” (as amended); MIL-P-18682D, “Pump, Centrifugal, Main Condenser Circulating, Naval Shipboard” (as amended); and MIL-P-18472G, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Condensate, Feed Booster, Waste Heat Boiler, And Distilling Plant” (as amended). Military specifications and standards are available for review at *http://everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS.*

(b) *Testing and calculations.* Determine the applicable constant load pump energy index (PEICL) or variable load pump energy index (PEIVL) using the test procedure set forth in appendix A of this subpart Y.
