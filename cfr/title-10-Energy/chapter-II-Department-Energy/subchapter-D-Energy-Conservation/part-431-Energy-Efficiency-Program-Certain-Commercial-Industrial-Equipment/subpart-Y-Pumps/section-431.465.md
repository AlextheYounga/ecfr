<sup>1</sup> Equipment class designations consist of a combination (in sequential order separated by periods) of: (1) An equipment family (ESCC = end suction close-coupled, ESFM = end suction frame mounted/own bearing, IL = in-line, RSV = radially split, multi-stage, vertical, in-line diffuser casing, ST = submersible turbine; all as defined in § 431.462); (2) nominal speed of rotation (1800 = 1800 rpm, 3600 = 3600 rpm); and (3) an operating mode (CL = constant load, VL = variable load). Determination of the operating mode is determined using the test procedure in appendix A to this subpart.

<sup>2</sup> For equipment classes ending in .CL, the relevant PEI is PEICL. For equipment classes ending in .VL, the relevant PEI is PEIVL.

<sup>3</sup> The C-values shown in this table must be used in the equation for PERSTD when calculating PEICL or PEIVL, as described in section II.B of appendix A to this subpart.

(c) The energy efficiency standards in paragraph (b) of this section do not apply to the following pumps:

(1) Fire pumps;

(2) Self-priming pumps;

(3) Prime-assist pumps;

(4) Magnet driven pumps;

(5) Pumps designed to be used in a nuclear facility subject to 10 CFR part 50, “Domestic Licensing of Production and Utilization Facilities”;

(6) Pumps meeting the design and construction requirements set forth in Military Specification MIL-P-17639F, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Miscellaneous Service, Naval Shipboard Use” (as amended); MIL-P-17881D, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Boiler Feed, (Multi-Stage)” (as amended); MIL-P-17840C, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Close-Coupled, Navy Standard (For Surface Ship Application)” (as amended); MIL-P-18682D, “Pump, Centrifugal, Main Condenser Circulating, Naval Shipboard” (as amended); MIL-P-18472G, “Pumps, Centrifugal, Condensate, Feed Booster, Waste Heat Boiler, And Distilling Plant” (as amended). Military specifications and standards are available for review at *http://everyspec.com/MIL-SPECS*.

(d) The energy conservation standards in paragraph (b) of this section apply only to pumps that have the following characteristics:

(1) Flow rate of 25 gpm or greater at BEP at full impeller diameter;

(2) Maximum head of 459 feet at BEP at full impeller diameter and the number of stages required for testing;

(3) Design temperature range from 14 to 248 °F;

(4) Designed to operate with either:

(i) A 2- or 4-pole induction motor; or

(ii) A non-induction motor with a speed of rotation operating range that includes speeds of rotation between 2,880 and 4,320 revolutions per minute and/or 1,440 and 2,160 revolutions per minute; and

(iii) In either case, the driver and impeller must rotate at the same speed;

(5) For ST pumps, a 6-inch or smaller bowl diameter; and

(6) For ESCC and ESFM pumps, specific speed less than or equal to 5,000 when calculated using U.S. customary units.
