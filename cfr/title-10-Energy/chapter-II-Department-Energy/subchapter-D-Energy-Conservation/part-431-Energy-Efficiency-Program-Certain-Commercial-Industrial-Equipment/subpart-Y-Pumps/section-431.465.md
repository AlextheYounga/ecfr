<sup>1</sup> Equipment class designations consist of a combination (in sequential order separated by periods) of: (1) An equipment family (ESCC = end suction close-coupled, ESFM = end suction frame mounted/own bearing, IL = in-line, RSV = radially split, multi-stage, vertical, in-line diffuser casing, ST = submersible turbine; all as defined in § 431.462); (2) nominal speed of rotation (1800 = 1800 rpm, 3600 = 3600 rpm); and (3) an operating mode (CL = constant load, VL = variable load). Determination of the operating mode is determined using the test procedure in appendix A to this subpart.

<sup>2</sup> For equipment classes ending in .CL, the relevant PEI is PEICL. For equipment classes ending in .VL, the relevant PEI is PEIVL.

<sup>3</sup> The C-values shown in this table must be used in the equation for PERSTD when calculating PEICL or PEIVL, as described in section II.B of appendix A to this subpart.
