##### § 431.86 Uniform test method for the measurement of energy efficiency of commercial packaged boilers. #####

(a) *Scope.* This section provides test procedures, pursuant to the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), as amended, which must be followed for measuring the combustion efficiency and/or thermal efficiency of a gas- or oil-fired commercial packaged boiler.

(b) *Testing and Calculations.* Determine the thermal efficiency or combustion efficiency of commercial packaged boilers by conducting the appropriate test procedure(s) indicated in Table 1 of this section.
