Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 89306, Dec. 9, 2016.

(a) Each commercial packaged boiler manufactured on or after January 1, 1994, and before March 2, 2012, must meet the following energy efficiency standard levels:

(1) For a gas-fired packaged boiler with a capacity (rated maximum input) of 300,000 Btu/h or more, the combustion efficiency at the maximum rated capacity must be not less than 80 percent.

(2) For an oil-fired packaged boiler with a capacity (rated maximum input) of 300,000 Btu/h or more, the combustion efficiency at the maximum rated capacity must be not less than 83 percent.

(b) Each commercial packaged boiler listed in Table 1 to § 431.87 and manufactured on or after the effective date listed in Table 1 of this section, must meet the applicable energy conservation standard in Table 1.
