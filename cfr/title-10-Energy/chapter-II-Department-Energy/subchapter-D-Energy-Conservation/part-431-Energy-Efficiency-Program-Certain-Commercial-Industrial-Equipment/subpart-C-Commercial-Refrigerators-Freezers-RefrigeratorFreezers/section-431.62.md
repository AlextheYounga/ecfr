(5) Has transparent or solid doors, sliding or hinged doors, a combination of hinged, sliding, transparent, or solid doors, or no doors;

(6) Is designed for pull-down temperature applications or holding temperature applications; and

(7) Is connected to a self-contained condensing unit or to a remote condensing unit.

*Door* means a movable panel that separates the interior volume of a unit of commercial refrigeration equipment from the ambient environment and is designed to facilitate access to the refrigerated space for the purpose of loading and unloading product. This includes hinged doors, sliding doors, and drawers. This does not include night curtains.

*Door angle* means:

(1) For equipment with flat doors, the angle between a vertical line and the line formed by the plane of the door, when the equipment is viewed in cross-section; and

(2) For equipment with curved doors, the angle formed between a vertical line and the straight line drawn by connecting the top and bottom points where the display area glass joins the cabinet, when the equipment is viewed in cross-section.

*Holding temperature application* means a use of commercial refrigeration equipment other than a pull-down temperature application, except a blast chiller or freezer.

*Horizontal Closed* means equipment with hinged or sliding doors and a door angle greater than or equal to 45°.

*Horizontal Open* means equipment without doors and an air-curtain angle greater than or equal to 80° from the vertical.

*Ice-cream freezer* means a commercial freezer that is designed to operate at or below −5 °F (±2 °F) (−21 °C ±1.1 °C) and that the manufacturer designs, markets, or intends for the storing, displaying, or dispensing of ice cream.

*Integrated average temperature* means the average temperature of all test package measurements taken during the test.

*Lighting occupancy sensor* means a device which uses passive infrared, ultrasonic, or other motion-sensing technology to automatically turn off or dim lights within the equipment when no motion is detected in the sensor's coverage area for a certain preset period of time.

*Lowest application product temperature* means the lowest integrated average temperature at which a given basic model is capable of consistently operating (*i.e.,* maintaining so as to comply with the steady-state stabilization requirements specified in ASHRAE 72-2005 (incorporated by reference, see § 431.63) for the purposes of testing under the DOE test procedure).

*Night curtain* means a device which is temporarily deployed to decrease air exchange and heat transfer between the refrigerated case and the surrounding environment.

*Operating temperature* means the range of integrated average temperatures at which a self-contained commercial refrigeration unit or remote-condensing commercial refrigeration unit with a thermostat is capable of operating or, in the case of a remote-condensing commercial refrigeration unit without a thermostat, the range of integrated average temperatures at which the unit is marketed, designed, or intended to operate.

*Pull-down temperature application* means a commercial refrigerator with doors that, when fully loaded with 12 ounce beverage cans at 90 degrees F, can cool those beverages to an average stable temperature of 38 degrees F in 12 hours or less.

*Rating temperature* means the integrated average temperature a unit must maintain during testing (i.e., either as listed in the table at § 431.66(d)(1) or the lowest application product temperature).

*Remote condensing unit* means a factory-made assembly of refrigerating components designed to compress and liquefy a specific refrigerant that is remotely located from the refrigerated equipment and consists of 1 or more refrigerant compressors, refrigerant condensers, condenser fans and motors, and factory supplied accessories.

*Scheduled lighting control* means a device which automatically shuts off or dims the lighting in a display case at scheduled times throughout the day.

*Self-contained condensing unit* means a factory-made assembly of refrigerating components designed to compress and liquefy a specific refrigerant that is an integral part of the refrigerated equipment and consists of 1 or more refrigerant compressors, refrigerant condensers, condenser fans and motors, and factory supplied accessories.

*Semivertical Open* means equipment without doors and an air-curtain angle greater than or equal to 10° and less than 80° from the vertical.

*Service over counter* means equipment that has sliding or hinged doors in the back intended for use by sales personnel, with glass or other transparent material in the front for displaying merchandise, and that has a height not greater than 66 inches and is intended to serve as a counter for transactions between sales personnel and customers. “*Service over the counter, self-contained, medium temperature commercial refrigerator”,* also defined in this section, is one specific equipment class within the service over counter equipment family.

*Service over the counter, self-contained, medium temperature commercial refrigerator* or *SOC-SC-M* means a commercial refrigerator—
