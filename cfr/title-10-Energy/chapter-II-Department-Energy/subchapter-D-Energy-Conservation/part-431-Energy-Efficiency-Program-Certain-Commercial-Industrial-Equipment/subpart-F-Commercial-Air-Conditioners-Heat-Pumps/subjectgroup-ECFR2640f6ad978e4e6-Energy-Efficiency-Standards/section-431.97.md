##### § 431.97 Energy efficiency standards and their compliance dates. #####

(a) All basic models of commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment must be tested for performance using the applicable DOE test procedure in § 431.96, be compliant with the applicable standards set forth in paragraphs (b) through (i) of this section, and be certified to the Department under 10 CFR part 429.

(b) Each air-cooled commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment (excluding air-cooled equipment with cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h and double-duct air conditioners or heat pumps) manufactured on or after January 1, 2023, and before January 1, 2029, must meet the applicable minimum energy efficiency standard level(s) set forth in table 1 to this paragraph (b). Each air-cooled commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment (excluding air-cooled equipment with cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h and double-duct air conditioners or heat pumps) manufactured on or after January 1, 2029, must meet the applicable minimum energy efficiency standard level(s) set forth in table 2 to this paragraph (b). Each water-cooled commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment manufactured on or after the compliance date listed in table 3 to this paragraph (b) must meet the applicable minimum energy efficiency standard level(s) set forth in table 3. Each evaporatively-cooled commercial air conditioning and heating equipment manufactured on or after the compliance date listed in table 4 to this paragraph (b) must meet the applicable minimum energy efficiency standard level(s) set forth in table 4. Each double-duct air conditioner or heat pump manufactured on or after January 1, 2010, must meet the applicable minimum energy efficiency standard level(s) set forth in table 5 to this paragraph (b).
