##### § 434.403 Building mechanical systems and equipment. #####

Mechanical systems and equipment used to provide heating, ventilating, and air conditioning functions as well as additional functions not related to space conditioning, such as, but not limited to, freeze protection in fire projection systems and water heating, shall meet the requirements of this section.

403.1 *Mechanical Equipment Efficiency.* When equipment shown in Tables 403.1a through 403.1f is used, it shall have a minimum performance at the specified rating conditions when tested in accordance with the specified reference standard. The reference standards listed in Tables 403.1a through 403.1f are incorporated by reference, see § 434.701. Omission of minimum performance requirements for equipment not listed in Tables 403.1a through 403.1f does not preclude use of such equipment.

|<sup>a</sup> Insulation R-values, measured in (h.ft <sup>2</sup>.°F)/Btu, are for the insulation as installed and do not include film resistance. The required minimum thickness do not consider water vapor transmission and possible surface condensation. The required minimum thicknesses do not consider water vapor transmission and condensation. For ducts that are designed to convey both heated and cooled air, duct insulation shall be as required by the most restrictive condition.

(a) Factory-installed plenums, casings, or ductwork furnished as a part of the HVAC equipment tested and rated in accordance with subsection 403.1

(b) Ducts within the conditioned space that they serve. (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701)ca a06oc0.186

403.2.9.3 *Duct and Plenum Construction.* All air-handling ductwork and plenums shall be constructed and erected in accordance with RS-34, RS-35, and RS-36 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701). Where supply ductwork and plenums designed to operate at static pressures from 0.25 in. wc to 2 in. wc, inclusive, are located outside of the conditioned space or in return plenums, joints shall be sealed in accordance with Seal Class C as defined in RS-34 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701). Pressure sensitive tape shall not be used as the primary sealant where such ducts are designed to operate at static pressures of 1 in. wc, or greater.

403.2.9.3.1 Ductwork designed to operate at static pressures in excess of 3 in. wc shall be leak-tested in accordance with Section 5 of RS-35, (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701), or equivalent. Test reports shall be provided in accordance with Section 6 of RS-35, (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701)m or equivalent. The tested duct leakage class at a test pressure equal to the design duct pressure class rating shall be equal to or less than leakage Class 6 as defined in Section 4.1 of RS-35 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701). Representative sections totaling at least 25% of the total installed duct area for the designated pressure class shall be tested.

403.2.10 *Completion.*

403.2.10.1 *Manuals.* Construction documents shall require an operating and maintenance manual provided to the Federal Agency. The manual shall include, at a minimum, the following:

(a) Submittal data stating equipment size and selected options for each piece of equipment requiring maintenance, including assumptions used in outdoor design calculations.

(b) Operating and maintenance manuals for each piece of equipment requiring maintenance. Required maintenance activity shall be specified.

(c) Names and addresses of at least one qualified service agency to perform the required periodic maintenance shall be provided.

(d) HVAC controls systems maintenance and calibration information, including wiring diagrams, schematics, and control sequence descriptions. Desired or field determined setpoints shall be permanently recorded on control drawings, at control devices, or, for digital control systems, in programming comments.

(e) A complete narrative, prepared by the designer, of how each system is intended to operate shall be included with the construction documents.

403.2.10.2 *Drawings.* Construction documents shall require that within 30 days after the date of system acceptance, record drawings of the actual installation be provided to the Federal agency. The drawings shall include details of the air barrier installation in every envelope component, demonstrating continuity of the air barrier at all joints and penetrations.

403.2.10.3 *Air System Balancing.* Construction documents shall require that all HVAC systems be balanced in accordance with the industry accepted procedures (such as National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB) Procedural Standards, Associated Air Balance Council (AABC) National Standards, or ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 111). Air and water flow rates shall be measured and adjusted to deliver final flow rates within 10% of design rates, except variable flow distribution systems need not be balanced upstream of the controlling device (VAV box or control valve).

403.2.10.3.1 Construction documents shall require a written balance report be provided to the Federal agency for HVAC systems serving zones with a total conditioned area exceeding 5,000 ft2.

403.2.10.3.2 Air systems shall be balanced in a manner to first minimize throttling losses, then fan speed shall be adjusted to meet design flow conditions or equivalent procedures. Exceptions are as follows: Damper throttling may be used for air system balancing;

(a) With fan motors of 1 hp (0.746 kW) or less, or

(b) Of throttling results in no greater than 1/3 hp (0.248 kW) fan horsepower draw above that required if the fan speed were adjusted.

403.2.10.4 *Hydronic System Balancing.* Hydronic systems shall be balanced in a manner to first minimize throttling losses; then the pump impeller shall be trimmed or pump speed shall be adjusted to meet design flow conditions. Exceptions are as follows:

(a) Pumps with pump motors of 10 hp (7.46 kW) or less.

(b) If throttling results in no greater than 3 hp (2.23 kW) pump horsepower draw above that required if the impeller were trimmed.

(c) To reserve additional pump pressure capability in open circuit piping systems subject to fouling. Valve throttling pressure drop shall not exceed that expected for future fouling.

403.2.10.5 *Control System Testing.* HVAC control systems shall be tested to assure that control elements are calibrated, adjusted, and in proper working condition. For projects larger than 50,000 ft2 conditioned area, detailed instructions for commissioning HVAC systems shall be provided by the designer in plans and specifications.
