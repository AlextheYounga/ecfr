##### § 434.508 Determination of the design energy consumption and design energy cost. #####

508.1 The Design Energy Consumption shall be calculated by modeling the Proposed Design using the same methods, assumptions, climate data, and simulation tool as were used to establish the Energy Cost Budget, except as explicitly stated in 509 through 534. The Design Energy Cost shall be calculated per Equation 508.1.

![](/graphics/er06oc00.027.gif)Based on:DECOSm = DECONml × ECOSml + . . . + DECONmi × ECOSmi (Equation 508.1.2)Where:DECOS = The annual Design Energy CostDECOSm = The monthly Design Energy CostDECONmi = The monthly Design Energy Consumption of the ith type of energyECOSmi = The monthly Energy Cost per unit of the ith type of energy

The DECONmi shall be calculated from the first day through the last day of the month, inclusive.
