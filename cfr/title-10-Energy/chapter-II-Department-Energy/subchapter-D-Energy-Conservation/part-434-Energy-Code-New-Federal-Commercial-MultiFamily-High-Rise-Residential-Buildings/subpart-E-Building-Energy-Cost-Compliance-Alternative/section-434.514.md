514.1 Interior Lighting Power Allowance (ILPA), for calculating the Energy Cost Budget shall be determined from subsection 401.3.2. The lighting power used to calculate the Design Energy Consumption shall be the actual adjusted power for lighting in the Proposed Design. If the lighting controls in the Proposed Design are more effective at saving energy than those required by subsection 401.3.1 and 401.3.2, the actual installed lighting power shall be used along with the schedules reflecting the action of the controls to calculate the Design Energy Consumption. This actual installed lighting power shall not be adjusted by the Power Adjustment Factors listed in Table 514.1.

|       Automatic control device(s)        |Standard PAF|
|------------------------------------------|------------|
|           (1) Occupancy Sensor           |    0.30    |
| (2) Daylight Sensing Continuous Dimming  |    0.30    |
|(3) Daylight Sensing Multiple Step Dimming|    0.20    |
|       (4) Daylight Sensing On/Off        |    0.10    |
|          (5) Lumen Maintenance           |    0.10    |

514.2 Table 513.2.b establishes default assumptions for the percentage of the lighting load switched-on in each Prototype or Reference Building by hour of the day. These default assumptions can be changed when calculating the Energy Cost Budget to provide, for example, a 12-hour rather than an 8-hour workday.
