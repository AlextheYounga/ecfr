##### § 434.402 Building envelope assemblies and materials. #####

The building envelope and its associated assemblies and materials shall meet the provisions of this section.

402.1 *Calculations and Supporting Information.*

402.1.1 *Material Properties.* Information on thermal properties, building envelope system performance, and component heat transfer shall be obtained from RS-4. When the information is not available from RS-4, (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) the data shall be obtained from manufacturer's information or laboratory or field test measurements using RS-5, RS-6, RS-7, or RS-8 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701).

402.1.1.1 The shading coefficient (SC) for fenestration shall be obtained from RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) or from manufacturer's test data. The shading coefficient of the fenestration, including both internal and external shading devices, is SCX and excludes the effect of external shading projections, which are calculated separately. The shading coefficient used for louvered shade screens shall be determined using a profile angle of 30 degrees as found in Table 41, Chapter 27 of RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701).

402.1.2 *Thermal Performance Calculations.* The overall thermal transmittance of the building envelope shall be calculated in accordance with Equation 402.1.2:

![](/graphics/er06oc00.022.gif)Where:Uo = the area-weighted average thermal transmittance of the gross area of the building envelope; *i.e.,* the exterior wall assembly including fenestration and doors, the roof and ceiling assembly, and the floor assembly, Btu/(h·ft2·°F)Ao = the gross area of the building envelope, ft2Ui = the thermal transmittance of each individual path of the building envelope, *i.e.,* the opaque portion or the fenestration, Btu/(h·ft2·°F)Ui = 1/Ri (where Ri is the total resistance to heat flow of an individual path through the building envelope)Ai = the area of each individual element of the building envelope, ft2

The thermal transmittance of each component of the building envelope shall be determined with due consideration of all major series and parallel heat flow paths through the elements of the component and film coefficients and shall account for any compression of insulation. The thermal transmittance of opaque elements of assemblies shall be determined using a series path procedure with corrections for the presence of parallel paths within an element of the envelope assembly (such as wall cavities with parallel paths through insulation and studs). The thermal performance of adjacent ground in below-grade applications shall be excluded from all thermal calculations.

402.1.2.1 Envelope Assemblies Containing Metal Framing. The thermal transmittance of the envelope assembly containing metal framing shall be determined from one of three methods:

(a) Laboratory or field test measurements based on RS-5, RS-6, RS-7, or RS-8 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701).

(b) The zone method described in Chapter 22 of RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) and the formulas on page 22.10.

(c) For metal roof trusses or metal studs covered by Tables 402.1.2.1a and b, the total resistance of the series path shall be calculated in accordance with the following Equations:

![](/graphics/er06oc00.023.gif)Where:Rt = the total resistance of the envelope assemblyRi = the resistance of the series elements (for i = 1 to n) excluding the parallel path element(s)Re = the equivalent resistance of the element containing the parallel path (R-value of insulation × Fc). Values for Fc and equivalent resistances shall be taken from Tables 402.1.2.1a or b.

402.1.2.2 *Envelope Assemblies Containing Nonmetal Framing.* The thermal transmittance of the envelope assembly shall be determined from laboratory or field test measurements based on RS-5, RS-6, RS-7, or RS-8 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) or from the series-parallel (isothermal planes) method provided in page 23.2 of Chapter 23 of RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701).

402.1.2.3 *Metal Buildings.* For elements with internal metallic structures bonded on one or both sides to a metal skin or covering, the calculation procedure specified in RS-9 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) shall be used.

402.1.2.4 *Fenestration Assemblies.* Determine the overall thermal transmittance of fenestration assemblies in accordance with RS-18 and RS-19 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) or by calculation. Calculation of the overall thermal transmittance of fenestration assemblies shall consider the center-of-glass, edge-of-glass, and frame components.

(a) The following equation 402.1.2.4a shall be used.

![](/graphics/er06oc00.024.gif)Where:Uof = the overall thermal transmittance of the fenestration assemblies, including the center-of-glass, edge-of-glass, and frame components, Btu/(h·ft2·°F)i = numerical subscript (1, 2, . . .n) refers to each of the various fenestration types present in the walln = the number of fenestration assemblies in the wall assemblyUcg = the thermal transmittance of the center-of-glass area, Btu/(h·ft2·°F)Acg = the center of glass area, that is the overall visible glass area minus the edge-of-glass area, ft2Ueg = the thermal transmittance of the edge of the visible glass area including the effects of spacers in multiple glazed units, Btu/(h·ft2·°F)Aeg = the edge of the visible glass area, that is the 2.5 in. perimeter band adjacent to the frame, ft2Uf = the thermal transmittance of the frame area, Btu/(h·ft2·°F)Af = the frame area that is the overall area of the entire glazing product minus the center-of-glass area and minus the edge-of-glass area, ft2

(b) Values of Uof shall be based on one of the following methods:

(1) Results from laboratory test of center-of-glass, edge-of-glass, and frame assemblies tested as a unit at winter conditions. One of the procedures in Section 8.3.2 of RS-1 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) shall be used.

(2) Overall generic product C (commercial) in Table 13, Chapter 27, of the RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701). The generic product C in Table 13, Chapter 27, is based on a product of 24 ft2. Larger units will produce lower U-values and thus it is recommended to use the calculation procedure detailed in Equation 402.1.2.4a.

(3) Calculations based on the actual area for center-of-glass, edge-of-glass, and frame assemblies and on the thermal transmittance of components derived from 402.1.2.4a, 402.1.2.4b or a combination of the two.

402.1.3 *Gross Areas of Envelope Components.*

402.1.3.1 *Roof Assembly.* The gross area of a roof assembly shall consist of the total surface of the roof assembly exposed to outside air or unconditioned spaces and is measured from the exterior faces of exterior walls and centerline of walls separating buildings. The roof assembly includes all roof or ceiling components through which heat may flow between indoor and outdoor environments, including skylight surfaces but excluding service openings. For thermal transmittance purposes when return air ceiling plenums are employed, the roof or ceiling assembly shall not include the resistance of the ceiling or the plenum space as part of the total resistance of the assembly.

402.1.3.2 *Floor Assembly.* The gross area of a floor assembly over outside or unconditioned spaces shall consist of the total surface of the floor assembly exposed to outside air or unconditioned space and is measured from the exterior face of exterior walls and centerline of walls separating buildings. The floor assembly shall include all floor components through which heat may flow between indoor and outdoor or unconditioned space environments.

402.1.3.3 *Wall Assembly.* The gross area of exterior walls enclosing a heated or cooled space is measured on the exterior and consists of the opaque walls, including between-floor spandrels, peripheral edges of flooring, window areas (including sash), and door areas but excluding vents, grilles, and pipes.

402.2 *Air Leakage and Moisture Mitigation.* The requirements of this section shall apply only to those building components that separate interior building conditioned space from the outdoors or from unconditioned space or crawl spaces. Compliance with the criteria for air leakage through building components shall be determined by tests conducted in accordance with RS-10 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701).

402.2.1 *Air Barrier System.* A barrier against leakage shall be installed to prevent the leakage of air through the building envelope according to the following requirements:

(a) The air barrier shall be continuous at all plumbing and heating penetrations of the building opaque wall.

(b) The air barrier shall be sealed at all penetrations of the opaque building wall for electrical and telecommunications equipment.

The position of the vapor retarder shall be determined taking into account local climate and indoor humidity levels. The methodologies presented in Chapter 20 of RS-4 (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) shall be used to determine temperature and water vapor profiles through the envelope systems to assess the potential for condensation within the envelope and to determine the position of the vapor retarder within the envelope system.

(b) The vapor retarder shall be installed over the entire building envelope.

(c) The perm rating requirements of the vapor retarder shall be determined using the methodologies contained in Chapter 20 of RS-4, (incorporated by reference, see § 434.701) and shall take into account local climate and indoor humidity level. The vapor retarder shall have a performance rating of 1 perm or less.

402.3 *Thermal Performance Criteria.*

402.3.1 *Roofs; Floors and Walls Adjacent to Unconditioned Spaces.* The area weighted average thermal transmittance of roofs and also of floors and walls adjacent to unconditioned spaces shall not exceed the criteria in Table 402.3.1a. Exceptions are as follows: Skylights for which daylight credit is taken may be excluded from the calculations of the roof assembly Uor if all of the following conditions are met:

(a) The opaque roof thermal transmittance is less than the criteria in Table 402.3.1b.

(b) Skylight areas, including framing, as a percentage of the roof area do not exceed the values specified in Table 402.3.1b. The maximum skylight area from Table 402.3.1b may be increased by 50% if a shading device is used that blocks over 50% of the solar gain during the peak cooling design condition. For shell buildings, the permitted skylight area shall be based on a light level of 30 foot candles and a lighting power density (LPD) of less than 1.0 w/ft2. For speculative buildings, the permitted skylight area shall be based on the unit lighting power allowance from Table 401.3.2a and an illuminance level as follows: for LPD \<1.0, use 30 footcandles; for 1.0 \<LPD \<2.5, use 50 footcandles; and for LPD ≥2.5, use 70 footcandles.

(c) All electric lighting fixtures within daylighted zones under skylights are controlled by automatic daylighting controls.

(d) The Uo of the skylight assembly including framing does not exceed\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Btu/(h·ft2·°F) [Use 0.70 for ≤8000 HDD65 and 0.45 for \>8000 HDD65 or both if the jurisdiction includes cities that are both below and above 8000 HDD65.]

(e) Skylight curb U-value does not exceed 0.21 Btu/(h·ft2·°F).

(f) The infiltration coefficient of the skylights does not exceed 0.05 cfm/ft2.
