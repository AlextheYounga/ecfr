##### § 430.5 Error correction procedures for energy conservation standards rules. #####

(a) *Scope and purpose.* The regulations in this section describe procedures through which the Department of Energy accepts and considers submissions regarding possible Errors in its rules under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6291-6317). This section applies to rules establishing or amending energy conservation standards under the Act, except that this section does not apply to direct final rules issued pursuant to section 325(p)(4) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(p)(4)).

(b) *Definitions.*

*Act* means the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6291-6317).

*Error* means an aspect of the regulatory text of a rule that is inconsistent with what the Secretary intended regarding the rule at the time of posting. Examples of possible mistakes that might give rise to Errors include:

(i) A typographical mistake that causes the regulatory text to differ from how the preamble to the rule describes the rule;

(ii) A calculation mistake that causes the numerical value of an energy conservation standard to differ from what technical support documents would justify; or

(iii) A numbering mistake that causes a cross-reference to lead to the wrong text.

*Rule* means a rule establishing or amending an energy conservation standard under the Act.

*Secretary* means the Secretary of Energy or an official with delegated authority to perform a function of the Secretary of Energy under this section.

(c) *Posting of rules.* (1) The Secretary will cause a rule under the Act to be posted on a publicly-accessible Web site.

(2) The Secretary will not submit a rule for publication in the Federal Register during 45 calendar days after posting the rule pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(3) Each rule posted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall bear the following disclaimer:

NOTICE: The text of this rule is subject to correction based on the identification of errors as defined in 10 CFR 430.5 before publication in the Federal Register. Readers are requested to notify the United States Department of Energy, by email at [EMAIL ADDRESS PROVIDED IN POSTED NOTICE], of any typographical or other errors, as described in such regulations, by no later than midnight on [DATE 45 CALENDAR DAYS AFTER DATE OF POSTING OF THE DOCUMENT ON THE DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE], in order that DOE may make any necessary corrections in the regulatory text submitted to the Office of the Federal Register for publication.

(d) *Request for correction.* (1) A person identifying an Error in a rule subject to this section may request that the Secretary correct the Error. Such a request must be submitted within 45 calendar days of the posting of the rule pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(2)(i) A request under this section must identify an Error with particularity. The request must state what text is claimed to be erroneous. The request must also provide text that the requester argues would be a correct substitute. If a requester is unable to identify a correct substitute, the requester may submit a request that states that the requester is unable to determine what text would be correct and explains why the requester is unable to do so. The request must also substantiate the claimed Error by citing evidence from the existing record of the rulemaking that the text of the rule as issued is inconsistent with what the Secretary intended the text to be.

(ii) A person's disagreement with a policy choice that the Secretary has made will not, on its own, constitute a valid basis for a request under this section.

(3) The evidence to substantiate a request (or evidence of the Error itself) must be in the record of the rulemaking at the time of the rule's posting, which may include the preamble accompanying the rule. The Secretary will not consider new evidence submitted in connection with a request.

(4) A request under this section must be filed in electronic format by email to the address that the rule designates for correction requests. Should filing by email not be feasible, the requester should contact the program point of contact designated in the rule regarding an appropriate alternative means of filing a request.

(5) A request that does not comply with the requirements of this section will not be considered.

(e) *Correction of rules.* The Secretary may respond to a request for correction under paragraph (d) of this section or address an Error discovered on the Secretary's own initiative by submitting to the Office of the Federal Register either a corrected rule or the rule as previously posted.

(f) *Publication in the**Federal Register.* (1) If, after receiving one or more properly filed requests for correction, the Secretary decides not to undertake any corrections, the Secretary will submit the rule for publication to the Office of the Federal Register as it was posted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(2) If the Secretary receives no properly filed requests after posting a rule and identifies no Errors on the Secretary's own initiative, the Secretary will in due course submit the rule, as it was posted pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, to the Office of the Federal Register for publication. This will occur after the period prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section has elapsed.

(3) If the Secretary receives a properly filed request after posting a rule pursuant to (c)(1) and determines that a correction is necessary, the Secretary will, absent extenuating circumstances, submit a corrected rule for publication in the Federal Register within 30 days after the period prescribed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section has elapsed.

(4) Consistent with the Act, compliance with an energy conservation standard will be required upon the specified compliance date as published in the relevant rule in the Federal Register.

(5) Consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act, and other applicable law, the Secretary will ordinarily designate an effective date for a rule under this section that is no less than 30 days after the publication of the rule in the Federal Register.

(6) When the Secretary submits a rule for publication, the Secretary will make publicly available a written statement indicating how any properly filed requests for correction were handled.

(g) *Alteration of standards.* Until an energy conservation standard has been published in the Federal Register, the Secretary may correct such standard, consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act.

(h) *Judicial review.* For determining the prematurity, timeliness, or lateness of a petition for judicial review pursuant to section 336(b) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 6306), a rule is considered “prescribed” on the date when the rule is published in the Federal Register.
