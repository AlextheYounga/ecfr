The energy and water (in the case of faucets, showerheads, water closets, and urinals) conservation standards for the covered product classes are:

(a) *Refrigerators/refrigerator-freezers/freezers.* These standards do not apply to refrigerators and refrigerator-freezers with total refrigerated volume exceeding 39 cubic feet (1104 liters) or freezers with total refrigerated volume exceeding 30 cubic feet (850 liters). The energy standards as determined by the equations of the following table(s) shall be rounded off to the nearest kWh per year. If the equation calculation is halfway between the nearest two kWh per year values, the standard shall be rounded up to the higher of these values.

(1) The following standards apply to products manufactured on or before September 15, 2014, and before the 2029/2030 compliance dates depending on product class (see paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section).

(B) For boilers that fire at a single input rate, the automatic means for adjusting water temperature requirement may be satisfied by providing an automatic means that allows the burner or heating element to fire only when the means has determined that the inferred heat load cannot be met by the residual heat of the water in the system.

(C) When there is no inferred heat load with respect to a hot water boiler, the automatic means described in this paragraph shall limit the temperature of the water in the boiler to not more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

(D) A boiler for which an automatic means for adjusting water temperature is required shall be operable only when the automatic means is installed.

(v) A boiler that is manufactured to operate without any need for electricity or any electric connection, electric gauges, electric pumps, electric wires, or electric devices is not required to meet the AFUE or design requirements applicable to the boiler requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, but must meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, as applicable.

(ii) Compact size dishwashers shall not exceed 222 kwh/year and 3.5 gallons per cycle. Compact size dishwashers have a capacity less than eight place settings plus six serving pieces as specified in AHAM DW-1-2020 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) using the test load specified in section 2.3 of appendix C1 or section 2.4 of appendix C2 in subpart B of this part, as applicable.

(*3*) Is designed and marketed as a lamp that has at least one setting that allows the user to change the lamp's correlated color temperature (CCT) and has no setting in which the lamp meets the definition of a colored lamp (as defined in § 430.2); and is sold in packages of two lamps or less;

(*4*) Is designed and marketed as a lamp that has at least one setting in which the lamp meets the definition of a colored lamp (as defined in § 430.2) and at least one other setting in which it does not meet the definition of colored lamp (as defined in § 430.2) and is sold in packages of two lamps or less; or

(*5*) Is designed and marketed as a lamp that has one or more component(s) offering a completely different functionality (*e.g.,* a speaker, a camera, an air purifier, etc.) where each component is integrated into the lamp but does not affect the light output of the lamp (*e.g.,* does not turn the light on/off, dim the light, change the color of the light, etc.), is capable of operating in standby mode, and is sold in packages of two lamps or less.
