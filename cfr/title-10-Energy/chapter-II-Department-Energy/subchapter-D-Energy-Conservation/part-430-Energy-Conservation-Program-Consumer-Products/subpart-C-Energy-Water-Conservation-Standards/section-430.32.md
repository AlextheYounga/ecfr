(B) For boilers that fire at a single input rate, the automatic means for adjusting water temperature requirement may be satisfied by providing an automatic means that allows the burner or heating element to fire only when the means has determined that the inferred heat load cannot be met by the residual heat of the water in the system.

(C) When there is no inferred heat load with respect to a hot water boiler, the automatic means described in this paragraph shall limit the temperature of the water in the boiler to not more than 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

(D) A boiler for which an automatic means for adjusting water temperature is required shall be operable only when the automatic means is installed.

(v) A boiler that is manufactured to operate without any need for electricity or any electric connection, electric gauges, electric pumps, electric wires, or electric devices is not required to meet the AFUE or design requirements applicable to the boiler requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, but must meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, as applicable.

(ii) Compact size dishwashers shall not exceed 222 kwh/year and 3.5 gallons per cycle. Compact size dishwashers have a capacity less than eight place settings plus six serving pieces as specified in AHAM DW-1-2020 (incorporated by reference, see § 430.3) using the test load specified in section 2.3 of appendix C1 or section 2.4 of appendix C2 in subpart B of this part, as applicable.

(C) The standards described in paragraph (dd)(1)(iv) of this section do not apply to a general service lamp that:

(*1*) Is a general service organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lamps (as defined in § 430.2);

(*2*) Is a non-integrated lamp that is capable of operating in standby mode and is sold in packages of two lamps or less;

(*3*) Is designed and marketed as a lamp that has at least one setting that allows the user to change the lamp's correlated color temperature (CCT) and has no setting in which the lamp meets the definition of a colored lamp (as defined in § 430.2); and is sold in packages of two lamps or less;

(*4*) Is designed and marketed as a lamp that has at least one setting in which the lamp meets the definition of a colored lamp (as defined in § 430.2) and at least one other setting in which it does not meet the definition of colored lamp (as defined in § 430.2) and is sold in packages of two lamps or less; or

(*5*) Is designed and marketed as a lamp that has one or more component(s) offering a completely different functionality (*e.g.,* a speaker, a camera, an air purifier, etc.) where each component is integrated into the lamp but does not affect the light output of the lamp (*e.g.,* does not turn the light on/off, dim the light, change the color of the light, etc.), is capable of operating in standby mode, and is sold in packages of two lamps or less.
