(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to clothes dryers; and

(2) For each basic model of clothes dryers a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy consumption or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:
