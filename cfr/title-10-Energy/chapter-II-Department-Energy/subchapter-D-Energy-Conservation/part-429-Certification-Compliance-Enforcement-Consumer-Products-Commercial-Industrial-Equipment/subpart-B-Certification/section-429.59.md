(1) Units to be tested. The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to pumps; and for each basic model, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(i) Any value of the constant or variable load pump energy index or other measure of energy consumption must be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

and *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the maximum of the ith sample;

Or,

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:
