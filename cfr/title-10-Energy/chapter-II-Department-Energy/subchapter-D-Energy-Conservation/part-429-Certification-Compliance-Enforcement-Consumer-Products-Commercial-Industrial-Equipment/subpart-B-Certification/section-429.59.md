##### § 429.59 Pumps. #####

(a) *Determination of represented value.* Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model by testing (which includes the calculation-based methods in the test procedure), in conjunction with the following sampling provisions. Manufacturers must update represented values to account for any change in the applicable motor standards in § 431.25 of this chapter and certify amended values as of the next annual certification.

(1) Units to be tested. The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to pumps; and for each basic model, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(i) Any value of the constant or variable load pump energy index or other measure of energy consumption must be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er25ja16.025.gif)

and *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the maximum of the ith sample;

Or,

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

![](/graphics/er25ja16.026.gif)

and *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B of part 429);

and

(ii) Any measure of energy efficiency of a basic model must be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er25ja16.027.gif)

and *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the maximum of the ith sample;

Or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

![](/graphics/er25ja16.028.gif)

and *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of subpart B).

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to pumps; and
