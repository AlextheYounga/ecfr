##### ยง 429.26 Fluorescent lamp ballasts. #####

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to fluorescent lamp ballasts; and

(2) For each basic model of fluorescent lamp ballasts, a sample of sufficient size, not less than four, shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(i) Any represented value of estimated annual energy operating costs, energy consumption, or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The upper 99 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.01, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the ballast luminous efficiency, power factor, or other measure of the energy efficiency or energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor a higher value must be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of ยง 429.12 are applicable to fluorescent lamp ballasts; and

(2) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following public product-specific information: The ballast luminous efficiency, the power factor, the number of lamps operated by the ballast, and the type of lamps operated by the ballast.

(c) *Rounding requirements.* (1) Round ballast luminous efficiency to the nearest thousandths place.

(2) Round power factor to the nearest hundredths place.
