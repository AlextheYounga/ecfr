##### § 429.19 Dishwashers. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 90118, Dec. 13, 2016.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to dishwashers; and

(2) For each basic model of dishwashers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy or water consumption or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The upper 971/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the energy or water factor or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The lower 971/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to dishwashers; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The estimated annual energy use in kilowatt hours per year (kWh/yr) and the water consumption in gallons per cycle.

(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following additional product-specific information when using appendix C or appendix C1: the capacity in number of place settings as specified in ANSI/AHAM DW-1-1992 when using appendix C (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4) and ANSI/AHAM DW-1-2010 when using appendix C1 (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4), presence of a soil sensor (if yes, the number of cycles required to reach calibration), and the water inlet temperature used for testing in degrees Fahrenheit ( °F). When using appendix C1, additionally: the cycle selected for energy testing and whether that cycle is soil-sensing, the options selected for the energy test, and presence of a built-in water softening system (if yes, the energy use in kilowatt-hours and the water use in gallons required for each regeneration of the water softening system, the number of regeneration cycles per year, and data and calculations used to derive these values).
