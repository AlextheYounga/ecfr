Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 48357, July 27, 2023.Note 1 to § 429.19:

Prior to February 17, 2023, certification reports must be submitted as required either in this section or 10 CFR 429.19 as it appears in the 10 CFR parts 200 through 499 edition revised as of January 1, 2022. On or after February 17, 2023, certification reports must be submitted as required in this section.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to dishwashers; and

(2) For each basic model of dishwashers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—

(i) Any represented value of estimated annual operating cost, energy or water consumption or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The upper 971/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the energy or water factor or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to dishwashers; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The estimated annual energy use in kilowatt hours per year (kWh/yr), the water consumption in gallons per cycle, and the capacity in number of place settings as specified in ANSI/AHAM DW-1-2010 (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4).

(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following additional product-specific information:

(i) The presence of a soil sensor, and if yes, the number of cycles required to reach calibration;

(ii) The water inlet temperature used for testing in degrees Fahrenheit ( °F);

(iii) The cycle selected for the energy test and whether that cycle is soil-sensing;

(iv) The options selected for the energy test;

(v) Presence of a built-in water softening system, and if yes, the energy use in kilowatt-hours and the water use in gallons required for each regeneration of the water softening system, the number of regeneration cycles per year, and data and calculations used to derive these values; and

(vi) Indication of whether Cascade Complete powder was used as the detergent formulation in lieu of Cascade with the Grease Fighting Power of Dawn powder.
