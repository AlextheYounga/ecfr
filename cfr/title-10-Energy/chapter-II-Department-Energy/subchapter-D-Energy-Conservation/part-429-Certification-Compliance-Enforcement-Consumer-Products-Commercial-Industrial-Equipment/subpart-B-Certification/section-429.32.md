(a) *Determination of represented value.* Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model of ceiling fan by testing, in conjunction with the following sampling provisions:

(1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to ceiling fans; and

(2) For each basic model of ceiling fan selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(i) Any represented value of the efficiency or airflow is less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; or

(B) The lower 90 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.9, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.90 is the t statistic for a 90% one-tailed confidence interval with n−1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B); and

(ii) Any represented value of the wattage is greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; or

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.1, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n−1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to this subpart).

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to ceiling fans; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The number of speeds within the ceiling fan controls and a declaration that the manufacturer has incorporated the applicable design requirements.
