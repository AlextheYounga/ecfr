(2) For each basic model of ceiling fan, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—

(i) Any represented value of the efficiency or airflow is less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(3) For each basic model of ceiling fan,

(i) Any represented value of blade span, as defined in section 1.4 of appendix U to subpart B of part 430, is the mean of the blade spans measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest inch;

(ii) Any represented value of blade revolutions per minute (RPM) is the mean of the blade RPM measurements measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest RPM;

(iii) Any represented value of blade edge thickness is the mean of the blade edge thicknesses measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest 0.01 inch;

(iv) Any represented value of the distance between the ceiling and the lowest point on the fan blades is the mean of the distances measured for the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, rounded to the nearest quarter of an inch;

(v) Any represented value of tip speed is pi multiplied by represented value of blade span divided by twelve multiplied by the represented value of RPM, rounded to the nearest foot per minute; and

(vi) Any represented value of airflow (CFM) at high speed, including the value used to determine whether a ceiling fan is a highly-decorative ceiling fan as defined in section 1.10 of appendix U to subpart B of part 430, is determined pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) and rounded to the nearest CFM.

(4) To determine representative values of airflow, energy use, and estimated yearly energy cost of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model, use the following provisions.

(i) Airflow. Determine the represented value for airflow by calculating the weighted-average airflow of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:

![](/graphics/er16au22.004.gif)Where:CFMave = represented value of ceiling fan airflow, rounded to the nearest CFM.CFMLow = represented value of measured airflow, in cubic feet per minute, at low fan speed, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.CFMHigh = represented value of measured airflow, in cubic feet per minute, at high fan speed, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.3.0 = average daily operating hours at low fan speed, pursuant to Table 3 in appendix U to subpart B of part 430.3.4 = average daily operating hours at high fan speed, pursuant to Table 3 in appendix U to subpart B of part 430.6.4 = total average daily operating hours.

(ii) Energy Use. Determine represented value for energy use by calculating the weighted-average power consumption of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:

![](/graphics/er16au22.005.gif)Where:Wave = represented value power consumption, rounded to the nearest watt,WLow = represented value of measured power consumption, in watts, at low fan speed, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.WHigh = represented value of measured power consumption, in watts, at high fan speed, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.WSb = represented value of measured power consumption, in watts, in standby mode, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.3.0 = average daily operating hours at low fan speed, pursuant to Table 3 in appendix U to subpart B of part 430.3.4 = average daily operating hours at high fan speed, pursuant to Table 3 in appendix U to subpart B of part 430.17.6 = average daily standby mode hours, pursuant to Table 3 in appendix U to subpart B of part 430.6.4 = total average daily operating hours.

(iii) Estimated Yearly Energy Cost. Determine the represented value for estimated yearly energy cost of an LSSD or VSD ceiling fan basic model at low and high fan speed as follows:

![](/graphics/er16au22.006.gif)Where:EYEC = represented value for estimated yearly energy cost, rounded to the nearest dollar,WLow = represented value of measured power consumption, in watts, at low fan speed, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.WHigh = represented value of measured power consumption, in watts, at high fan speed, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.WSb = represented value of measured power consumption, in watts, in standby mode, pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.CKWH = representative average unit cost of electrical energy in dollars per kilowatt-hour pursuant to 16 CFR part 305.3.0 = average daily operating hours at low fan speed, pursuant to Table 3 in appendix U to subpart B of part 4303.4 = average daily operating hours at high fan speed, pursuant to Table 3 in appendix U to subpart B of part 430.17.6 = average daily standby mode hours, pursuant to Table 3 in appendix U to subpart B of part 430.365 = number of days per year.1000 = conversion factor from watts to kilowatts.

(c) *Rounding requirements.* Any represented value of ceiling fan efficiency, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, must be expressed in cubic feet per minute per watt (CFM/W) and rounded to the nearest whole number. Any represented value of ceiling fan energy index, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, must be expressed in CFEI and rounded to the nearest hundredth.
