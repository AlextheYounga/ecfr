##### § 429.32 Ceiling fans. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 50422, Aug. 16, 2022.Note 1 to § 429.32:

Prior to February 17, 2023, certification reports must be submitted as required either in this section or 10 CFR 429.32 as it appears in the 10 CFR parts 200 through 499 edition revised as of January 1, 2022. On or after February 17, 2023, certification reports must be submitted as required in this section.

(a) *Determination of represented value.* Manufacturers must determine the represented value, which includes the certified rating, for each basic model of ceiling fan by testing, in conjunction with the following sampling provisions:

(1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to ceiling fans; and

(2) For each basic model of ceiling fan selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(i) Any represented value of the efficiency or airflow is less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; or

(B) The lower 90 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.9, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.90 is the t statistic for a 90% one-tailed confidence interval with n−1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B); and

(ii) Any represented value of the wattage is greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; or

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.1, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n−1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to this subpart).

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to ceiling fans; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:

(i) For all ceiling fans: Blade span (in), and the number of speed control settings.

(ii) For small-diameter ceiling fans: A declaration of whether the ceiling fan is a multi-head ceiling fan, and the ceiling fan efficiency (CFM/W).

(iii) For large-diameter ceiling fans: Ceiling fan energy index (CFEI) for high speed, and 40 percent speed or the nearest speed that is not less than 40 percent speed.

(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following additional product-specific information:

(i) For all ceiling fans: A declaration that the manufacturer has incorporated the applicable design requirements.

(ii) For small-diameter ceiling fans: Standby power, blade edge thickness (in), airflow (CFM) at high speed, and blade revolutions per minute (RPM) at high speed.

(iii) For low-speed small-diameter ceiling fans: The distance (in) between the ceiling and the lowest point on the fan blades (in both hugger and standard configurations for multi-mount fans).

(c) *Rounding requirements.* Any represented value of ceiling fan efficiency, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, must be expressed in cubic feet per minute per watt (CFM/W) and rounded to the nearest whole number. Any represented value of ceiling fan energy index, as described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, must be expressed in CFEI and rounded to the nearest hundredth.
