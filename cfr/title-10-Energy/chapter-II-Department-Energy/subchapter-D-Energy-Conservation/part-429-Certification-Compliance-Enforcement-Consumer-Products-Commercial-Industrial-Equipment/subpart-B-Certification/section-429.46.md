##### § 429.46 Commercial clothes washers. #####

Note 1 to § 429.46:

Prior to February 17, 2023, certification reports must be submitted as required either in this section or 10 CFR 429.46 as it appears in the 10 CFR parts 200 through 499 edition revised as of January 1, 2022. On or after February 17, 2023, certification reports must be submitted as required in this section.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to commercial clothes washers; and

(2) For each basic model of commercial clothes washers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—

(i) Any represented value of the integrated water factor or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The upper 971/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the modified energy factor, active-mode energy efficiency ratio, water efficiency ratio, or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The lower 971/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

(3) The clothes container capacity of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the measured clothes container capacity (C) of all tested units of the basic model.

(4) The corrected remaining moisture content (RMC) of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the final RMC value measured for all tested units of the basic model.

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to commercial clothes washers; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:

(i) The modified energy factor (MEFJ2), in cubic feet per kilowatt-hour per cycle (cu ft/kWh/cycle);

(ii) The integrated water factor (IWF), in gallons per cycle per cubic feet (gal/cycle/cu ft);

(iii) The clothes container capacity, in cubic feet (cu ft);

(iv) The type of loading (top-loading or front-loading); and

(v) The corrected RMC (expressed as a percentage).

(c) *Reported values.* Values reported pursuant to this section must be rounded as follows: Clothes container capacity to the nearest 0.1 cu ft, and corrected RMC to the nearest 0.1 percentage point.
