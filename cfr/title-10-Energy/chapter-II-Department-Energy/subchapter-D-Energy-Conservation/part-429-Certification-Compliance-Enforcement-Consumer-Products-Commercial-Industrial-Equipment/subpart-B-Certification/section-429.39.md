(ii) For all wired and fixed-location wireless battery chargers other than uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) tested under appendix Y1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter: Battery discharge energy (Ebatt) in watt hours (Wh), active charge energy (Ea) in watt hours (Wh), maintenance mode power (Pm) in watts (W), no-battery mode power (Pnb) in watts (W), standby mode power (Psb) in watts (W), off mode power (Poff) in watts (W), and duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (tcd) in hours (hrs);

(iv) For UPSs: average load adjusted efficiency (Effavg).

(2) *Units to be tested.* (i) The general requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to all battery chargers; and

(ii) For each basic model of battery chargers other than UPSs tested under appendix Y to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that the represented value of UEC is greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er12de16.015.gif)and, *x* is the sample mean; *n* is the number of samples; and *x*i is the UEC of the *i*th sample; or,

(B) The upper 97.5-percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

![](/graphics/er12de16.016.gif)and *x* is the sample mean; *s* is the sample standard deviation; *n* is the number of samples; and *t*0.975 is the t-statistic for a 97.5-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of this subpart).

(iii) For each basic model of battery chargers other than UPSs tested under appendix Y to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, using the sample from paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, calculate the represented values of each metric (*i.e.,* maintenance mode power (Pm), standby power (Psb), off mode power (Poff), battery discharge energy (Ebatt), 24-hour energy consumption (E24), and duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (tcd)), where the represented value of the metric is:

![](/graphics/er12de16.017.gif)and, *x* is the sample mean, *n* is the number of samples, and *x*i is the measured value of the *i*th sample for the metric.

(iv) For each basic model of UPSs, the represented value of Effavg must be calculated using one of the following two methods:

(A) A sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that the represented value of Effavg is less than or equal to the lower of:

(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er12de16.018.gif)and, *x* is the sample mean; *n* is the number of samples; and *x*i is the Effavg of the *i*th sample; or,

(*2*) The lower 97.5-percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

![](/graphics/er12de16.019.gif)and *x* is the sample mean; *s* is the sample standard deviation; *n* is the number of samples; and *t*0.975 is the t-statistic for a 97.5-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of this subpart).

(B) The represented value of Effavg is equal to the Effavg of the single unit tested.

(v) For each basic model of battery chargers other than UPSs tested under appendix Y1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that the represented value of Ea for all wired and fixed-location wireless chargers (or the represented value of Pnb for all open-placement wireless chargers) is greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er09oc24.003.gif)

and, *x* is the sample mean; *n* is the number of samples; and *x*i is the Ea (or Pnb, when applicable) of the *i*th sample; or,

(B) The upper 97.5-percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

![](/graphics/er09oc24.004.gif)

and, *x* is the sample mean; *s* is the sample standard deviation; *n* is the number of samples; and *t*0.975 is the Student's t-Distribution Values for a 97.5-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to this subpart).

(vi) For each basic model of battery chargers other than UPSs tested under appendix Y1 to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter, using the sample from paragraph (a)(2)(v) of this section, calculate the applicable represented values of each metric (*i.e.,* maintenance mode power (Pm), no-battery mode power (Pnb), standby power (Psb), off mode power (Poff), battery discharge energy (Ebatt), and duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (tcd)), where the represented value of the metric is:
