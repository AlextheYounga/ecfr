##### § 429.39 Battery chargers. #####

Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 89821, Dec. 12, 2016.

(a) *Determination of represented values.* Manufacturers must determine represented values, which include certified ratings, for each basic model of battery charger in accordance with the following sampling provisions.

(1) *Represented values include:* the unit energy consumption (UEC) in kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/yr), battery discharge energy (Ebatt) in watt-hours (Wh), 24-hour energy consumption (E24) in watt-hours (Wh), maintenance mode power (Pm) in watts (W), standby mode power (Psb) in watts (W), off mode power (Poff) in watts (W), and duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (tcd) in hours (hrs).

(2) *Units to be tested.* (i) The general requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to battery chargers; and

(ii) For each basic model, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that the represented value of UEC is greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er20my16.160.gif)and, *x* is the sample mean; *n* is the number of samples; and *x*i is the UEC of the *i*th sample or,

(B) The upper 97.5-percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

![](/graphics/er20my16.161.gif)and *x* is the sample mean; *s* is the sample standard deviation; *n* is the number of samples; and *t*0.975 is the t-statistic for a 97.5-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of this subpart).

(3) Using the sample from paragraph (a)(2) of this section, calculate the represented values of each metric (*i.e.,* maintenance mode power (Pm), standby power (Psb), off mode power (Poff), battery discharge energy (EBatt), 24-hour energy consumption (E24), and duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (tcd)), where:

![](/graphics/er20my16.162.gif)and, is x is the metric, the sample mean; *n* is the number of samples; and *x*i is the measured value of the *i*th sample for the metric *x.*

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to battery chargers.

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following product-specific information: The nameplate battery voltage of the test battery in volts (V), the nameplate battery charge capacity of the test battery in ampere-hours (Ah), and the nameplate battery energy capacity of the test battery in watt-hours (Wh). A certification report must also include the represented values, as determined in paragraph (a) of this section for the maintenance mode power (Pm), standby mode power (Psb), off mode power (Poff), battery discharge energy (Ebatt), 24-hour energy consumption (E24), duration of the charge and maintenance mode test (tcd), and unit energy consumption (UEC).

(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following product-specific information: The manufacturer and model of the test battery, and the manufacturer and model, when applicable, of the external power supply.
