(a) Determination of represented values. Manufacturers must determine the represented values, which include the certified ratings, for each basic model of commercial HVAC equipment either by testing, in conjunction with the applicable sampling provisions, or by applying an AEDM.

(1) *Units to be tested.* (i) If the represented value is determined through testing, the general requirements of § 429.11 are applicable; and

(ii) For each basic model selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—

(A) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model, or of a tested combination for variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps certified to standards in terms of IEER as provided at paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:

(B) Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model, or of a tested combination for variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps certified to standards in terms of IEER as provided at paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er31de13.163.gif)And, *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; or,

(iii) For packaged terminal air conditioners and packaged terminal heat pumps, the represented value of cooling capacity shall be the average of the capacities measured for the sample selected as described in (a)(1)(ii) of this section, rounded to the nearest 100 Btu/h.

(iv) For air-cooled commercial package air-conditioning and heating equipment, the represented value of cooling capacity must be a self-declared value corresponding to the nearest appropriate Btu/h multiple according to Table 4 of ANSI/AHRI 340/360-2007 (incorporated by reference; see § 429.4) that is no less than 95 percent of the mean of the capacities measured for the units in the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section.

(2) *Alternative efficiency determination methods.* (i) In lieu of testing, a represented value of efficiency or consumption for a basic model of commercial HVAC equipment must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70 and the provisions of this section, where:

(A) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the output of the AEDM and less than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model; and

(B) Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the output of the AEDM and greater than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model.

(ii) For air-cooled commercial package air-conditioning and heating equipment, the represented value of cooling capacity must be the cooling capacity output simulated by the AEDM as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(3) *Product-specific provisions for determination of represented values.* (i) Direct-expansion-dedicated outdoor air systems (DX-DOASes):

(A) Individual model selection:

(*1*) Representations for a basic model must be based on the least efficient individual model(s) distributed in commerce among all otherwise comparable model groups comprising the basic model, considering only individual models as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A)(*2*) of this section. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), an “otherwise comparable model group” means a group of individual models distributed in commerce within the basic model that do not differ in components that affect energy consumption as measured according to the applicable test procedure specified at 10 CFR 431.96 other than those listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 1 (or none of the components listed in table 1). An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.

(*2*) For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 1 included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 2.2.2 of appendix B to subpart F of part 431.

(C) *Represented Values for Different Indoor Unit Combinations.* (*1*) If a basic model includes only one type of indoor unit combination (*i.e.,* ducted, non-ducted, or SDHV), a manufacturer must determine the represented values for the basic model in accordance with the sampling plan set forth in § 429.11 and paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the represented values are determined through testing, or in accordance with the provisions for applying an AEDM set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and § 429.70. Indoor unit models must be selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

(*2*) If a basic model includes more than one type of indoor unit combination (*i.e.,* ducted, non-ducted, and/or SDHV):

(*i*) A manufacturer must determine separate represented values for each type of indoor unit combination. If the represented values are determined through testing, a manufacturer must test, at a minimum, a single tested combination that represents each type of indoor unit combination included in that basic model. A manufacturer may alternatively determine separate represented values through application of an AEDM as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and § 429.70. Indoor unit models within the indoor unit combination must be selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

(*ii*) A manufacturer may also determine optional “mixed” representations by calculating the mean value across any two required representations described in the paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C)(*2*)(*i*) of this section (*i.e.,* a representation for “mixed ducted/non-ducted” would be determined by averaging the ducted representation and the non-ducted representation; a representation for “mixed ducted/SDHV” would be determined by averaging the ducted representation and the SDHV representation, and a representation for “mixed non-ducted/SDHV” would be determined by averaging the non-ducted representation and the SDHV representation).

An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 4 (or none of the components listed in table 4). An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.

(*2*) For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 4 to this paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A), the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 4 included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A)(*2*) shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 4 of appendix G1 to subpart F of 10 CFR part 431.

*(1)* Representations for a basic model must be based on the least efficient individual model(s) distributed in commerce among all otherwise comparable model groups comprising the basic model, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A)(*2*) of this section for individual models that include components listed in table 6 to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A)(*1*), “otherwise comparable model group” means a group of individual models distributed in commerce within the basic model that do not differ in components that affect energy consumption as measured according to the applicable test procedure specified at 10 CFR 431.96 other than those listed in table 6 to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 6 (or none of the components listed in table 6) to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.

*(2)* For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 6 to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section, the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 6 to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 3 of appendix C1 to subpart F of 10 CFR part 431.

|      Non-Standard High-Static Indoor Fan Motors      |The standard indoor fan motor is the motor specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions for testing and shall be distributed in commerce as part of a particular model. A non-standard high-static motor is an indoor fan motor that is not the standard indoor fan motor and that is distributed in commerce as part of an individual model within the same basic model.  <br/>For a non-standard high-static indoor fan motor(s) to be considered a specific component for a basic model (and thus subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A)(2) of this section), the following 2 provisions must be met:|

Non-standard high-static indoor fan motor(s) must meet the minimum allowable efficiency determined per section D.4.1 of AHRI 600-2023 (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4) for non-standard high-static indoor fan motors, or per section D.4.2 of AHRI 600-2023 for non-standard high-static indoor integrated fan and motor combinations.                                                                                                                                        |

If the standard indoor fan motor can vary fan speed through control system adjustment of motor speed, all non-standard high-static indoor fan motors must also allow speed control (including with the use of a variable-frequency drive).                                                                                                                                                                                           |
