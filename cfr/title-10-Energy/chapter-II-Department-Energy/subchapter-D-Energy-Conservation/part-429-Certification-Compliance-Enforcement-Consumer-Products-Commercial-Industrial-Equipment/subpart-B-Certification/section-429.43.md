(1) *Units to be tested.* (i) If the represented value is determined through testing, the general requirements of § 429.11 are applicable; and

(ii) For each basic model selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(A) Any represented value of energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model, or of a tested combination for variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps certified to standards in terms of IEER as provided at paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:

(B) Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model, or of a tested combination for variable refrigerant flow multi-split air conditioners and heat pumps certified to standards in terms of IEER as provided at paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(*1*) Representations for a basic model must be based on the least efficient individual model(s) distributed in commerce among all otherwise comparable model groups comprising the basic model, considering only individual models as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A)(*2*) of this section. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), an “otherwise comparable model group” means a group of individual models distributed in commerce within the basic model that do not differ in components that affect energy consumption as measured according to the applicable test procedure specified at 10 CFR 431.96 other than those listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 1 (or none of the components listed in table 1). An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.

(*2*) For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 1 included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 2.2.2 of appendix B to subpart F of part 431.
