(A) Individual model selection:

(*1*) Representations for a basic model must be based on the least efficient individual model(s) distributed in commerce among all otherwise comparable model groups comprising the basic model, considering only individual models as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A)(*2*) of this section. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3), an “otherwise comparable model group” means a group of individual models distributed in commerce within the basic model that do not differ in components that affect energy consumption as measured according to the applicable test procedure specified at 10 CFR 431.96 other than those listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 1 (or none of the components listed in table 1). An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.

(*2*) For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 1 to paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 1 included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 2.2.2 of appendix B to subpart F of part 431.

(C) *Represented Values for Different Indoor Unit Combinations.* (*1*) If a basic model includes only one type of indoor unit combination (*i.e.,* ducted, non-ducted, or SDHV), a manufacturer must determine the represented values for the basic model in accordance with the sampling plan set forth in § 429.11 and paragraph (a)(1) of this section if the represented values are determined through testing, or in accordance with the provisions for applying an AEDM set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and § 429.70. Indoor unit models must be selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

(*2*) If a basic model includes more than one type of indoor unit combination (*i.e.,* ducted, non-ducted, and/or SDHV):

(*i*) A manufacturer must determine separate represented values for each type of indoor unit combination. If the represented values are determined through testing, a manufacturer must test, at a minimum, a single tested combination that represents each type of indoor unit combination included in that basic model. A manufacturer may alternatively determine separate represented values through application of an AEDM as set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section and § 429.70. Indoor unit models within the indoor unit combination must be selected in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.

(*ii*) A manufacturer may also determine optional “mixed” representations by calculating the mean value across any two required representations described in the paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(C)(*2*)(*i*) of this section (*i.e.,* a representation for “mixed ducted/non-ducted” would be determined by averaging the ducted representation and the non-ducted representation; a representation for “mixed ducted/SDHV” would be determined by averaging the ducted representation and the SDHV representation, and a representation for “mixed non-ducted/SDHV” would be determined by averaging the non-ducted representation and the SDHV representation).

An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 4 (or none of the components listed in table 4). An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.

(*2*) For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 4 to this paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A), the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 4 included in individual models of the group.

*(1)* Representations for a basic model must be based on the least efficient individual model(s) distributed in commerce among all otherwise comparable model groups comprising the basic model, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A)(*2*) of this section for individual models that include components listed in table 6 to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A)(*1*), “otherwise comparable model group” means a group of individual models distributed in commerce within the basic model that do not differ in components that affect energy consumption as measured according to the applicable test procedure specified at 10 CFR 431.96 other than those listed in table 6 to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 6 (or none of the components listed in table 6) to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.

*(2)* For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 6 to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section, the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 6 to paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A) of this section included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 3 of appendix C1 to subpart F of 10 CFR part 431.

|      Non-Standard High-Static Indoor Fan Motors      |The standard indoor fan motor is the motor specified in the manufacturer's installation instructions for testing and shall be distributed in commerce as part of a particular model. A non-standard high-static motor is an indoor fan motor that is not the standard indoor fan motor and that is distributed in commerce as part of an individual model within the same basic model.  <br/>For a non-standard high-static indoor fan motor(s) to be considered a specific component for a basic model (and thus subject to the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)(v)(A)(2) of this section), the following 2 provisions must be met:|

Non-standard high-static indoor fan motor(s) must meet the minimum allowable efficiency determined per section D.4.1 of AHRI 600-2023 (incorporated by reference, see § 429.4) for non-standard high-static indoor fan motors, or per section D.4.2 of AHRI 600-2023 for non-standard high-static indoor integrated fan and motor combinations.                                                                                                                                        |

If the standard indoor fan motor can vary fan speed through control system adjustment of motor speed, all non-standard high-static indoor fan motors must also allow speed control (including with the use of a variable-frequency drive).                                                                                                                                                                                           |

(vi) *Commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment (excluding air-cooled equipment with a cooling capacity less than 65,000 Btu/h).* Before May 15, 2025, the provisions in 10 CFR 429.43, revised as of January 1, 2024, are applicable. On and after May 15, 2025, when certifying to energy conservation standards in terms of EER or IEER and (as applicable) COP, the provisions in paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(B) of this section apply. When certifying to energy conservation standards in terms of IVEC and (as applicable) IVHE, all provisions in this paragraph (a)(3)(vi) apply.

(A) For individual model selection when certifying to energy conservation standards in terms of IVEC and (as applicable) IVHE:

(*1*) Representations for a basic model must be based on the least-efficient individual model(s) distributed in commerce among all otherwise comparable model groups comprising the basic model, with selection of the least-efficient individual model considering all options for factory-installed components and manufacturer-supplied components for field installation, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(A)(*2*) of this section for individual models that include components listed in table 7 to paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(A) of this section. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(A)(*1*), “otherwise comparable model group” means a group of individual models distributed in commerce within the basic model that do not differ in components that affect energy consumption as measured according to the applicable test procedure specified at 10 CFR 431.96 other than those listed in table 7 to paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(A) of this section. An otherwise comparable model group may include individual models distributed in commerce with any combination of the components listed in table 7 (or none of the components listed in table 7). An otherwise comparable model group may consist of only one individual model.

(*2*) For a basic model that includes individual models distributed in commerce with components listed in table 7 to paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(A) of this section, the requirements for determining representations apply only to the individual model(s) of a specific otherwise comparable model group distributed in commerce with the least number (which could be zero) of components listed in table 7 to paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(A) included in individual models of the group. Testing under this paragraph (a)(3)(vi)(A)(*2*) shall be consistent with any component-specific test provisions specified in section 6 of appendix A1 to subpart F of 10 CFR part 431.
