##### § 429.20 Residential clothes washers. #####

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to residential clothes washers; and

(2) For each basic model of residential clothes washers, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—

(i) Any represented value of the integrated water factor, the estimated annual operating cost, the energy or water consumption, or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The upper 971/2 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

(ii) Any represented value of the integrated modified energy factor, energy efficiency ratio, water efficiency ratio, or other measure of energy or water consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The lower 971/2 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

(3) The clothes container capacity of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the measured clothes container capacity, C, of all tested units of the basic model.

(4) The remaining moisture content (RMC) of a basic model reported in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be the mean of the final RMC value measured for all tested units of the basic model.

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to residential clothes washers; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:

(i) For residential clothes washers tested in accordance with Appendix J1: The modified energy factor (MEF) in cubic feet per kilowatt hour per cycle (cu ft/kWh/cycle), the capacity in cubic feet (cu ft), the corrected remaining moisture content (RMC) expressed as a percentage, and, for standard-size residential clothes washers, a water factor (WF) in gallons per cycle per cubic foot (gal/cycle/cu ft).

(ii) For residential clothes washers tested in accordance with Appendix J2: The integrated modified energy factor (IMEF) in cu ft/kWh/cycle, the integrated water factor (IWF) in gal/cycle/cu ft, the capacity in cu ft, the corrected remaining moisture content (RMC) expressed as a percentage, and the type of loading (top-loading or front-loading).

(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report must include the following additional product-specific information: A list of all cycle selections comprising the complete energy test cycle for each basic model.

(c) *Reported values.* Values reported pursuant to this subsection must be rounded as follows: MEF and IMEF to the nearest 0.01 cu ft/kWh/cycle, WF and IWF to the nearest 0.1 gal/cycle/cu ft, RMC to the nearest 0.1 percentage point, and clothes container capacity to the nearest 0.1 cu ft.
