##### § 429.53 Walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers. #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 28835, May 4, 2023.

(a) *Determination of represented value.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 apply to walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers; and

(2) For each basic model of walk-in cooler and walk-in freezer refrigeration system, the annual walk-in energy factor (AWEF) must be determined either by testing, in accordance with § 431.304 of this chapter and the provisions of this section, or by application of an AEDM that meets the requirements of § 429.70 and the provisions of this section.

(i) *Applicable test procedure.* If the AWEF is determined by testing, refer to the following for the appropriate test procedure to use:

(A) *Unit cooler test procedure.* For unit coolers tested alone, use the test procedure in 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix C. Follow the general testing provisions in appendix C, sections 3.1 and 3.2, and the equipment-specific provisions in appendix C, section 3.3.

(B) *Dedicated condensing unit test procedure.* For dedicated condensing units tested alone, use the test procedure in 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix C. Follow the general testing provisions in appendix C, sections 3.1 and 3.2, and the product-specific provisions in appendix C, section 3.4. Outdoor dedicated condensing refrigeration systems that are also designated for use in indoor applications must be tested and certified as both an outdoor dedicated condensing refrigeration system and indoor dedicated condensing refrigeration system.

(C) *Single-Package dedicated system test procedure.* For single-package dedicated systems, use the test procedure in 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix C. Follow the general testing provisions in appendix C, sections 3.1 and 3.2, and the product-specific provisions in appendix C, section 3.3.

(D) *Matched refrigeration system test procedure.* For matched refrigeration systems, use the test procedure in 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix C. Follow the general testing provisions in appendix C, sections 3.1 and 3.2, and the product-specific provisions in appendix C, section 3.3. It is not necessary to rate a matched refrigeration system if the constituent unit cooler(s) and dedicated condensing unit have been tested and rated as specified paragraphs (a)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section, respectively. However, if a manufacturer wishes to represent the efficiency of the matched refrigeration system as distinct from the efficiency of either constituent component, or if the manufacturer cannot rate one or both of the constituent components using the specified method, the manufacturer must test and certify the matched refrigeration system as specified in this paragraph (a)(2)(i)(D).

(ii) *Units to be tested.* (A) If the represented value for a given refrigeration system basic model is determined through testing, the general requirements of § 429.11 apply; and

(B) For each basic model, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that any represented value of AWEF or other measure of energy efficiency of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er28de16.000.gif)

And *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample, or,

(*2*) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

![](/graphics/er28de16.001.gif)

And *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B).

(C) The represented value of net capacity shall be the average of the capacities measured for the sample selected.

(iii) *Alternative efficiency determination methods.* In lieu of testing, pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70 and the provisions of this section, a represented value of AWEF for a basic model of a walk-in cooler or walk-in freezer refrigeration system may be determined through the application of an AEDM, where:

(A) Any represented value of AWEF or other measure of energy efficiency of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the output of the AEDM and greater than or equal to the Federal standard for that basic model.

(B) The represented value of net capacity must be the net capacity simulated by the AEDM.

(3) For each basic model of walk-in cooler and walk-in freezer panel, display door, and non-display door, the R-value and/or energy consumption must be determined by testing, in accordance with § 431.304 of this chapter and the provisions of this section.

(i) *Applicable test procedure.* Refer to the following for the appropriate test procedure:

(A) *Display door test procedure.* For determining the energy consumption and rated surface area in square feet, use the test procedure in 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix A.

(B) *Non-display door test procedure.* For determining the energy consumption and rated surface area in square feet, use the test procedure in 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix A. For determining the R-value, use the test procedure in 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix B.

(C) *Panel test procedure.* For determining the R-value, use the test procedure in 10 CFR part 431, subpart R, appendix B.

(ii) *Units to be tested.* (A) The general requirements of § 429.11 apply; and

(B) For each basic model, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that—

(*1*) Any represented value of door energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(*i*) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er28de16.002.gif)

And *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample, or,

(*ii*) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

![](/graphics/er28de16.003.gif)

And *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B).

(*2*) Any represented R-value or other measure of energy efficiency of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(*i*) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er28de16.004.gif)

And x˜ is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample, or,

(*ii*) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

![](/graphics/er28de16.005.gif)

And x˜ is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t 0.95 is the statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degree of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B).
