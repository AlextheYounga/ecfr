(2) *P*W,OFF. If individual models of single-package systems or individual combinations (or “tested combinations”) of split systems that are otherwise identical are offered with multiple options for off mode-related components, determine the represented value for the individual model/combination with the crankcase heater and controls that are the most consumptive. A manufacturer may also determine represented values for individual models/combinations with less consumptive off mode options; however, all such options must be identified with different model numbers for single-package systems or for outdoor units (in the case of split systems).

(3) *Limitations for represented values of individual combinations.* The following paragraphs explains the limitations for represented values of individual combinations (or “tested combinations”).

(i) *Regional.* A basic model may only be certified as compliant with a regional standard if all individual combinations within that basic model meet the regional standard for which it is certified. If a model of outdoor unit is certified below a regional standard, then the model of outdoor unit must have a unique model number for distribution in each region. An ICM cannot certify a basic model containing a representative value that is more efficient than any combination certified by an OUM containing the same outdoor unit.

(ii) *Multiple product classes.* Models of outdoor units that are rated and distributed in individual combinations that span multiple product classes must be tested, rated, and certified pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section as compliant with the applicable standard for each product class. This includes multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems with a represented value for a mixed combination including both SDHV and either non-ducted or ducted indoor units.

(4) *Requirements.* All represented values under paragraph (a) of this section must be based on testing in accordance with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section or the application of an AEDM or other methodology as allowed in paragraph (c) of this section.

(b) *Units tested* - (1) *General.* The general requirements of § 429.11 apply to central air conditioners and heat pumps; and

(2) *Individual model/combination selection for testing.* (i) The table identifies the minimum testing requirements for each basic model that includes multiple individual models/combinations. For each basic model that includes only one individual model/combination, that individual model/combination must be tested.

(ii) Each individual model/combination (or “tested combination”) identified in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section is not required to be tested for PW,OFF. Instead, at a minimum, among individual models/combinations with similar off-mode construction (even spanning different models of outdoor units), a manufacturer must test at least one individual model/combination for PW,OFF.

(3) *Sampling plans and representative values.* (i) For individual models (for single-package systems) or individual combinations (for split-systems, including “tested combinations” for multi-split, multi-circuit, and multi-head mini-split systems) with represented values determined through testing, each individual model/combination (or “tested combination”) must have a sample of sufficient size tested in accordance with the applicable provisions of this subpart. For heat pumps (other than heating-only heat pumps), all units of the sample population must be tested in both the cooling and heating modes and the results used for determining all representations. The represented values for any individual model/combination must be assigned such that:

(i) *Off-Mode.* Any represented value of power consumption or other measure of energy consumption for which consumers would favor lower values must be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er08jn16.000.gif)and, x is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; Or,

(B) The upper 90 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

![](/graphics/er08jn16.001.gif)And x is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.90 is the t statistic for a 90 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n−1 degrees of freedom (from appendix D). Round represented values of off-mode power consumption to the nearest watt.

(ii) *SEER, EER, and HSPF.* Any represented value of the energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er08jn16.002.gif)and, x is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; or,

(B) The lower 90 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

![](/graphics/er08jn16.003.gif)And x is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.90 is the t statistic for a 90 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n−1 degrees of freedom (from Appendix D). Round represented values of EER, SEER, and HSPF to the nearest 0.05.

(iii) *Cooling Capacity.* The represented value of cooling capacity must be a self-declared value that is no less than 95 percent of the mean of the cooling capacities measured for the units in the sample, rounded:

(A) To the nearest 100 Btu/h if cooling capacity is less than 20,000 Btu/h,

(B) To the nearest 200 Btu/h if cooling capacity is greater than or equal to 20,000 Btu/h but less than 38,000 Btu/h, and

(C) To the nearest 500 Btu/h if cooling capacity is greater than or equal to 38,000 Btu/h and less than 65,000 Btu/h.

(iv) *Heating Capacity.* The represented value of heating capacity must be a self-declared value that is no less than 95 percent of the mean of the heating capacities measured for the units in the sample, rounded:

(A) To the nearest 100 Btu/h if heating capacity is less than 20,000 Btu/h,

(B) To the nearest 200 Btu/h if heating capacity is greater than or equal to 20,000 Btu/h but less than 38,000 Btu/h, and

(C) To the nearest 500 Btu/h if heating capacity is greater than or equal to 38,000 Btu/h and less than 65,000 Btu/h.

(c) *Determination of represented values for all other individual models/combinations besides those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section* - (1) *All basic models except outdoor units with no match and multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems.* (i) For every individual model/combination within a basic model other than the individual model/combination required to be tested pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, either -

(A) A sample of sufficient size, comprised of production units or representing production units, must be tested as complete systems with the resulting represented values for the individual model/combination obtained in accordance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (3) of this section; or

(B) The represented values of the measures of energy efficiency or energy consumption must be assigned through the application of an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and § 429.70. An AEDM may only be used to rate individual models/combinations in a basic model other than the individual model/combination required for mandatory testing under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section. No basic model may be rated with an AEDM (except for determination of PW,OFF).

(ii) For every individual model/combination within a basic model tested pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, but for which PW,OFF testing was not conducted, the represented value of PW,OFF may be assigned through, either:

(A) The testing result from an individual model/combination of similar off-mode construction, or

(B) The application of an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and § 429.70.

(2) *Outdoor units with no match.* All models of outdoor unit within a basic model must be tested. No model of outdoor unit may be rated with an AEDM.

(3) *Multi-split systems, multi-circuit systems, and multi-head mini-split systems.* The following applies:

(i) For basic models composed of both non-ducted and ducted combinations, the represented value for the mixed non-ducted/ducted combination is the mean of the represented values for the non-ducted and ducted combinations as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

(ii) For basic models composed of both SDHV and non-ducted or ducted combinations, the represented value for the mixed SDHV/non-ducted or SDHV/ducted combination is the mean of the represented values for the SDHV, non-ducted, or ducted combinations, as applicable, as determined in accordance with paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.

(iii) All other individual combinations of models of indoor units for the same model of outdoor unit for which the manufacturer chooses to make representations must be rated as separate basic models, and the provisions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) and (c)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section apply.

(iv) For every individual combination (or “tested combination”) within a basic model tested pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section, but for which PW,OFF testing was not conducted, the representative values of PW,OFF may be assigned through either:

(A) The testing result from an individual combination (or “tested combination”) of similar off-mode construction, or

(B) Application of an AEDM in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and § 429.70. No basic model may be rated with an AEDM for SEER, EER, or HSPF.

(d) *Alternative efficiency determination methods.* In lieu of testing, represented values of efficiency or consumption may be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70(e) and the provisions of this section.

(1) *Power or energy consumption.* Any represented value of the average off mode power consumption or other measure of energy consumption of an individual model/combination for which consumers would favor lower values must be greater than or equal to the output of the AEDM but no greater than the standard.
