##### § 429.69 Fans and blowers. #####

(a) *Determination of represented values of fans and blowers other than air circulating fans.* A manufacturer must determine the represented values for each basic model, either by testing in conjunction with the applicable sampling provisions or by applying an AEDM as set forth in this section and in § 429.70(n). Manufacturers must update represented values to account for any change in the applicable motor standards in Table 5 of § 431.25 of this chapter and certify amended values as of the next annual certification (as applicable).

(1) *Testing.* (i) If the represented values for a given basic model are determined through testing, a sample of at least one unit must be selected and the requirements of § 429.11 apply.

(ii) If only one unit is tested, at each duty point characterized by a flow and speed value, any represented value of fan electrical input power (“FEP”), fan shaft input power, or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the tested value. Represented values must be rounded to the nearest hundredth.

(iii) If only one unit is tested, at each duty point characterized by a flow and speed value, any represented value of fan electrical input power (“FEI”), or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the tested value. Represented values must be rounded to the nearest hundredth.

(iv) If more than one unit is tested, at each duty point characterized by a flow and speed value, any represented value of fan electrical input power (“FEP”), fan shaft input power, or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where

Where is *x* the sample mean; n is the number of samples, and *x*i is the ith sample. Or,

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

and *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of subpart B of this part). Represented values must be rounded to the nearest hundredth.

(v) If more than one unit is tested, any represented value of the fan energy index (“FEI”), or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where

Where *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples, and *x*i is the ith sample. Or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

and *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of subpart B of this part). Represented values must be rounded to the nearest hundredth.

(vi) At each duty point characterized by a flow and speed value, the representative value of static or total pressure of a basic model of must be the mean of the tested static or total pressure for each tested unit. If only one unit is tested, the representative value of static or total pressure at the duty point of a basic model is the tested value.

(2) *Alternative efficiency determination methods.* In lieu of testing, the represented values for a basic model must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70(n) and the provisions of this section, where: the represented values of any basic model used to validate an AEDM must be calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(b) *Determination of represented values for air circulating fans.* A manufacturer must determine the represented values for each basic model, either by testing in conjunction with the applicable sampling provisions or by applying an AEDM as set forth in this section and in § 429.70(n).

(1) *Testing.* (i) If the represented values for a given basic model are determined through testing, the requirements of § 429.11 apply.

(ii) Any represented value of fan electrical input power (“WE”), or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where

![](/graphics/er01my23.378.gif)

Where *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples, and xi is the ith sample. Or,

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

and *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of subpart B of this part). Represented values must be rounded to the nearest hundredth.

(iii) Any represented value of efficacy (Effcirc) or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where

![](/graphics/er01my23.380.gif)

Where *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples, and xi is the ith sample. Or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.95, where:

and *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of subpart B of this part). Represented values must be rounded to the nearest hundredth.

(2) *Alternative efficiency determination methods.* In lieu of testing, the represented values for a basic model must be determined through the application of an AEDM pursuant to the requirements of § 429.70(n) and the provisions of this section, where: the represented values of any basic model used to validate an AEDM must be calculated under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.
