##### ยง 429.54 Metal halide lamp ballasts and fixtures. #####

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to metal halide lamp ballasts; and

(2) For each basic model of metal halide lamp ballast selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size, not less than four, shall be selected at random and tested to ensure that:

(i) Any represented value of estimated energy efficiency calculated as the measured output power to the lamp divided by the measured input power to the ballast (Pout/Pin), of a basic model is less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

(B) The lower 99-percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.99.

And x is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.99 is the t statistic for a 99% two-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A).

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of ยง 429.12 are applicable to metal halide lamp ballasts; and

(2) Pursuant to ยง 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information: The minimum ballast efficiency in percent (%), the lamp wattage in watts (W), and the type of ballast (*e.g.,* pulse-start, magnetic probe-start, and non-pulse start electronic).
