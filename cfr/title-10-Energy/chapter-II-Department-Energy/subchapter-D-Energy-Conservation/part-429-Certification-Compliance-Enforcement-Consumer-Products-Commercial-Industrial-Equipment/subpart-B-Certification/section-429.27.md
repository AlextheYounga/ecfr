Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 43978, July 22, 2022.

(a) *Sampling plan for selection of units for testing.* (1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to general service fluorescent lamps, general service incandescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps; and

(2)(i) For each basic model of general service fluorescent lamp and incandescent reflector lamp, samples of production lamps shall be obtained from a 12-month period, tested, and the results averaged. A minimum sample of 21 lamps shall be tested. The manufacturer shall randomly select a minimum of three lamps from each month of production for a minimum of 7 out of the 12-month period. In the instance where production occurs during fewer than 7 of such 12 months, the manufacturer shall randomly select 3 or more lamps from each month of production, where the number of lamps selected for each month shall be distributed as evenly as practicable among the months of production to attain a minimum sample of 21 lamps. Any represented value of lamp efficacy of a basic model shall be based on the sample and shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by .97, where:

(ii) For each basic model of general service fluorescent lamp and general service incandescent lamp, the color rendering index (CRI) shall be measured from the same lamps selected for the lumen output and watts input measurements in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section, *i.e.,* the manufacturer shall measure all lamps for lumens, watts input, and CRI. The CRI shall be represented as the average of a minimum sample of 21 lamps and shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

Or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by .97, where:

(iii) For each basic model of general service incandescent lamp, for measurements of rated wattage and rated lumen output, samples of production lamps shall be obtained from a 12-month period, tested, and the results averaged. A minimum sample of 21 lamps shall be tested. The manufacturer shall randomly select a minimum of three lamps from each month of production for a minimum of 7 out of the 12-month period. In the instance where production occurs during fewer than 7 of such 12 months, the manufacturer shall randomly select 3 or more lamps from each month of production, where the number of lamps selected for each month shall be distributed as evenly as practicable among the months of production to attain a minimum sample of 21 lamps. Any represented value of rated wattage of a basic model shall be based on the sample and shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er27ja12.003.gif)and, *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; Or,

(B) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.03, where:

![](/graphics/er27ja12.004.gif)and *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95% two-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from Appendix A to this subpart).

(iv) For each basic model of general service incandescent lamp, for measurements of rated lifetime, a minimum sample of 21 lamps shall be tested. The manufacturer shall randomly select a minimum of three lamps from each month of production for a minimum of 7 out of the 12-month period. In the instance where production occurs during fewer than 7 of such 12 months, the manufacturer shall randomly select three or more lamps from each month of production, where the number of lamps selected for each month shall be distributed as evenly as practicable among the months of production to attain a minimum sample of 21 lamps. The lifetime shall be represented as the length of operating time between first use and failure of 50 percent of the sample size, in accordance with test procedures described in section 4.2 of Appendix R to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter. Compliance will be determined by the percentage of sample size that meets the minimum rated lifetime.

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to general service fluorescent lamps, general service incandescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:

(i) General service fluorescent lamps: The testing laboratory's ILAC accreditation body's identification number or other approved identification assigned by the ILAC accreditation body, production dates of the units tested, the 12-month average lamp efficacy in lumens per watt (lm/W), lamp wattage (W), correlated color temperature in Kelvin (K), and the 12-month average Color Rendering Index (CRI).

(ii) Incandescent reflector lamps: The testing laboratory's ILAC accreditation body's identification number or other approved identification assigned by the ILAC accreditation body, production dates of the units tested, the 12-month average lamp efficacy in lumens per watt (lm/W), and lamp wattage (W).

(iii) General service incandescent lamps: The testing laboratory's ILAC accreditation body's identification number or other approved identification assigned by the ILAC accreditation body, production dates of the units tested, the 12-month average maximum rate wattage in watts (W), the 12-month average minimum rated lifetime (hours), and the 12-month average Color Rendering Index (CRI).

(c) *Test data.* Manufacturers must include the production date codes and the accompanying decoding scheme corresponding to all of the units tested for a given basic model in the detailed test records maintained under § 429.71.
