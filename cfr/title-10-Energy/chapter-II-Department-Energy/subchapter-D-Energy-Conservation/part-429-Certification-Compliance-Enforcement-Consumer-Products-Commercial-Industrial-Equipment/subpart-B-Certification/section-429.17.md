Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 96235, Dec. 29, 2016.

(a) *Determination of represented value.* (1) As of July 13, 2015, manufacturers must determine the represented value for each new basic model of water heater by applying an alternative efficiency determination method (AEDM) in accordance with 10 CFR 429.70 or by testing for the uniform energy factor, in conjunction with the applicable sampling provisions as follows:

(i) If the represented value is determined through testing, the general requirements of 10 CFR 429.11 are applicable; and

(ii) For each basic model selected for testing, a sample of sufficient size shall be randomly selected and tested to ensure that -

(A) Any represented value of the energy consumption or other measure of energy use of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er29de16.005.gif)and, *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample;Or,

(*2*) The upper 95-percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.10, where

And *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from Appendix A).

(B) Any represented value of energy efficiency or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor higher values shall be less than or equal to the lower of:

(*1*) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er29de16.007.gif)and, *x* is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample;Or,

(*2*) The lower 95-percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.90, where:

And *x* is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95-percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from Appendix A).

(C) Any represented value of the rated storage volume must be equal to the mean of the measured storage volumes of all the units within the sample.

(D) Any represented value of first-hour rating or maximum gallons per minute (GPM) must be equal to the mean of the measured first-hour ratings or measured maximum GPM ratings, respectively, of all the units within the sample.

(2) For basic models initially certified before July 13, 2015 (using either the energy factor test procedure contained in appendix E to subpart B of 10 CFR part 430 of the January 1, 2015 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations or the thermal efficiency and standby loss test procedures contained in 10 CFR 431.106 of the January 1, 2015 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations, in conjunction with applicable sampling provisions), manufacturers must:

(i) Determine the represented value for each basic model by applying an AEDM in accordance with 10 CFR 429.70 or by testing for the uniform energy factor, in conjunction with the applicable sampling provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section; or

(ii) Calculate the uniform energy factor for each test sample by applying the following mathematical conversion factors to test data previously obtained through testing according to appendix E to subpart B of 10 CFR part 430 of the January 1, 2015 edition of the Code of Federal Regulations or the thermal efficiency and standby loss test procedures contained in 10 CFR 431.106 of the January 1, 2015, edition of the Code of Federal Regulations. Represented values of uniform energy factor, first-hour rating, and maximum GPM rating based on a calculation using this mathematical conversion factor must be determined using the applicable sampling provisions in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.

(A) Calculate the New First Hour Rating (New FHR) or New Max Gallons per Minute (New Max GPM), as applicable, using the equations presented in the table in this paragraph.
