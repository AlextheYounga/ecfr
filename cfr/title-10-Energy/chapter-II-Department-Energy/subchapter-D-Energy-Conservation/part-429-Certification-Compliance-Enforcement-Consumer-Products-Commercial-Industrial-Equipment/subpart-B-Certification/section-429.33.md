##### § 429.33 Ceiling fan light kits. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 43978, July 22, 2022.

(a) *Determination of represented value.* Manufacturers must determine represented values, which includes certified ratings, for each basic model of ceiling fan light kit in accordance with following sampling provisions.

(1) The requirements of § 429.11 are applicable to ceiling fan light kits, and

(2) For each basic model of ceiling fan light kit, the following sample size requirements are applicable to demonstrate compliance with the January 1, 2007 energy conservation standards:

(i) For ceiling fan light kits with medium screw base sockets that are packaged with compact fluorescent lamps, determine the represented values of each basic model of lamp packaged with the ceiling fan light kit in accordance with § 429.35.

(ii) For ceiling fan light kits with medium screw base sockets that are packaged with integrated light-emitting diode lamps, determine the represented values of each basic model of lamp packaged with the ceiling fan light kit in accordance with § 429.56.

(iii) For ceiling fan light kits with pin-based sockets that are packaged with fluorescent lamps, determine the represented values of each basic model of lamp packaged with the ceiling fan light kit in accordance with the sampling requirements in § 429.35.

(iv) For ceiling fan light kits with medium screw base sockets that are packaged with incandescent lamps, determine the represented values of each basic model of lamp packaged with the ceiling fan light kit in accordance with § 429.27.

(v) For ceiling fan light kits with sockets or packaged with lamps other than those described in paragraphs (a)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this section, each unit must comply with the applicable design standard in § 430.32(s)(5) of this chapter.

(3) For ceiling fan light kits that require compliance with the January 21, 2020 energy conservation standards:

(i) Determine the represented values of each basic model of lamp packaged with each basic model of ceiling fan light kit, in accordance with the specified section:

(A) For compact fluorescent lamps, § 429.35;

(B) For general service fluorescent lamps, § 429.27;

(C) For incandescent lamps, § 429.27;

(D) For integrated LED lamps, § 429.56.

(E) For other fluorescent lamps (not compact fluorescent lamps or general service fluorescent lamps), § 429.35; and

(F) For other SSL lamps (not integrated LED lamps), § 429.56.

(ii) Determine the represented value of each basic model of integrated SSL circuitry that is incorporated into each basic model of ceiling fan light kit by randomly selecting a sample of sufficient size and testing to ensure that any represented value of the energy efficiency of the integrated SSL circuitry basic model is less than or equal to the lower of:

(A) The mean of the sample, where:

and, x is the sample mean; n is the number of samples; and xi is the ith sample; Or,

(B) The lower 95 percent confidence limit (LCL) of the true mean divided by 0.90, where:

And x is the sample mean; s is the sample standard deviation; n is the number of samples; and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95% one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A to subpart B).

(b) *Certification reports.* (1) The requirements of § 429.12 are applicable to ceiling fan light kits; and

(2) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following public product-specific information:

(i) Ceiling fan light kits with sockets for medium screw base lamps: the rated wattage in watts (W) and the system's efficacy in lumens per watt (lm/W).

(ii) Ceiling fan light kits with pin-based sockets for fluorescent lamps: the rated wattage in watts (W), the system's efficacy in lumens per watt (lm/W), and the length of the lamp in inches (in).

(iii) Ceiling fan light kits with any other socket type: the rated wattage in watts (W) and the number of individual sockets.

(3) Pursuant to § 429.12(b)(13), a certification report shall include the following additional product-specific information: Ceiling fan light kits with any other socket type: a declaration that the basic model meets the applicable design requirement and the features that have been incorporated into the ceiling fan light kit to meet the applicable design requirement (*e.g.,* circuit breaker, fuse, ballast).

(c) *Rounding requirements.* Any represented value of initial lamp efficacy of CFLKs as described in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(E); system efficacy of CFLKs as described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii); luminaire efficacy of CFLKs as described in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section must be expressed in lumens per watt and rounded to the nearest tenth of a lumen per watt.
