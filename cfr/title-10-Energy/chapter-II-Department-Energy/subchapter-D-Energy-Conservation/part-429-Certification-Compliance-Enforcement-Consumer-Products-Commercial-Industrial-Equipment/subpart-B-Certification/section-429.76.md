##### ยง 429.76 Portable electric spas. #####

(a) *Determination of represented values.* Manufacturers must determine the represented values for each basic model of portable electric spas by testing in conjunction with the following provisions.

(1) For spa covers:

(i) If a basic model is distributed in commerce with multiple covers designated by the spa manufacturer for use with the basic model, a manufacturer must determine all represented values for that basic model based on the cover that results in the highest standby loss, except that the manufacturer may choose to identify specific individual combinations of spa and cover as additional basic models.

(ii) If a basic model is distributed in commerce with no cover designated by the spa manufacturer for use with the basic model, a manufacturer must determine all represented values for that basic model by testing as specified in section 3.1.5.2 of appendix GG to subpart B of this part.

(2) The sampling requirements of ยง 429.11 are applicable to portable electric spas; and

(3) For each basic model of portable electric spas, a sample of sufficient size must be randomly selected and tested to ensure that any representation of standby loss or other measure of energy consumption of a basic model for which consumers would favor lower values shall be greater than or equal to the higher of:

(i) The mean of the sample, where:

![](/graphics/er13jn23.005.gif)and x is the sample mean, n is the number of samples, and xi is the ith sample; or,

(ii) The upper 95 percent confidence limit (UCL) of the true mean divided by 1.05, where:

![](/graphics/er13jn23.006.gif)and x is the sample mean, s is the sample standard deviation, n is the number of samples, and t0.95 is the t statistic for a 95 percent one-tailed confidence interval with n-1 degrees of freedom (from appendix A of subpart B of part 429).

(4) The represented value of standby loss must be a whole number of watts.

(5) The represented value of fill volume of a basic model must be a whole number of gallons that is within 5 gallons of the mean of the fill volumes measured for the units in the sample selected as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.

(b) [Reserved]
