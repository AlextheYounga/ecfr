(a) *General.* The following provisions apply to assessment and enforcement testing of the relevant products and equipment.

(b) *Refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers* - (1) *Verification of total refrigerated volume.* The total refrigerated volume of the basic model will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of 10 CFR part 430 for each unit tested. The results of the measurement(s) will be averaged and compared to the value of total refrigerated volume certified by the manufacturer. The certified total refrigerated volume will be considered valid only if:

(i) The measurement is within two percent, or 0.5 cubic feet (0.2 cubic feet for compact products), whichever is greater, of the certified total refrigerated volume, or

(ii) The measurement is greater than the certified total refrigerated volume.

(A) If the certified total refrigerated volume is found to be valid, the certified adjusted total volume will be used as the basis for calculation of maximum allowed energy use for the basic model.

(B) If the certified total refrigerated volume is found to be invalid, the average measured adjusted total volume, rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic foot, will serve as the basis for calculation of maximum allowed energy use for the tested basic model.

(2) *Test for models with two compartments, each having its own user-operable temperature control.* The test described in section 3.3 of the applicable test procedure for refrigerators or refrigerator-freezers in appendix A to subpart B of 10 CFR part 430 shall be used for all units of a tested basic model before DOE makes a determination of noncompliance with respect to the basic model.

(c) *Clothes washers.* (1) *Determination of Remaining Moisture Content.* The procedure for determining remaining moisture content (RMC) will be performed once in its entirety, pursuant to the test requirements of section 3.8 of appendix J1 and appendix J2 to subpart B of part 430, for each unit tested.

(i) The measured RMC value of a tested unit will be considered the tested unit's final RMC value if the measured RMC value is within two RMC percentage points of the certified RMC value of the basic model (expressed as a percentage), or is lower than the certified RMC value.

(ii) If the measured RMC value of a tested unit is more than two RMC percentage points higher than the certified RMC value of the basic model, DOE will perform two additional replications of the RMC measurement procedure, each pursuant to the provisions of section 3.8.5 of appendix J1 and appendix J2 to subpart B of part 430, for a total of three independent RMC measurements of the tested unit. The average of the three RMC measurements will be the tested unit's final RMC value and will be used as the basis for the calculation of per-cycle energy consumption for removal of moisture from the test load for that unit.

The mean of the measurement(s) will be used to determine the applicable standards for purposes of compliance.

(h) *Residential boilers - test protocols for functional verification of automatic means for adjusting water temperature.* These tests are intended to verify the functionality of the design requirement that a boiler has an automatic means for adjusting water temperature for single-stage, two-stage, and modulating boilers. These test methods are intended to permit the functional testing of a range of control strategies used to fulfill this design requirement. Section 2, *Definitions,* and paragraph 6.1.a of appendix N to subpart B of part 430 of this chapter apply for the purposes of this paragraph (h).

(1) *Test protocol for all products other than single-stage products employing burner delay.* This test is intended to verify whether an automatic means for adjusting water temperature other than burner delay produces an incremental change in water supply temperature in response to an incremental change in inferred heat load.

(B) *Establishing flow rate and temperature rise.* Start the boiler without enabling the means for adjusting water temperature. Establish a water flow rate that allows for a water temperature rise of greater than or equal to 20 °F at maximum input rate.

(C) *Temperature stabilization.* Temperature stabilization is deemed to be obtained when the boiler supply water temperature does not vary by more than ±3 °F over a period of five minutes.

(D) *Adjust the inferential load controller.* (*1*) Adjust the boiler controls (in accordance with the I&O manual) to the default setting that allows for activation of the means for adjusting water temperature. For boiler controls that do not allow for control adjustment during active mode operation, terminate call for heat and adjust the inferential load controller in accordance with the I&O manual and then reinitiate call for heat.

(*2*) If the means for adjusting water temperature uses outdoor temperature reset, the maximum outdoor temperature setting (if equipped) should be set to a temperature high enough that the boiler operates continuously during the duration of this test (*i.e.,* if the conditions in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section equal room ambient temperature, then the maximum outdoor temperature should be set at a temperature greater than the ambient air temperature during the test).

(ii) *Establish low inferred load conditions at minimum boiler supply water temperature* - (A) *Establish low inferred load conditions.* (*1*) Establish the inferred load conditions (simulated using a controlling parameter, such as outdoor temperature, thermostat patterns, or boiler cycling) so that the supply water temperature is maintained at the minimum supply water temperature prescribed by the boiler manufacturer's temperature reset control strategy found in the I&O manual.

(*2*) The minimum supply water temperature of the default temperature reset curve is usually provided in the I&O manual. If there is no recommended minimum supply water temperature, set the minimum supply water temperature equal to 20 °F less than the high supply water temperature specified in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(A) of this section.

(B) *Supply water temperature stabilization at low inferred load.* (*1*) Maintain the call for heat until the boiler supply water temperature has stabilized. Temperature stabilization is deemed to be obtained when the boiler supply water temperature does not vary by more than ±3 °F over a period of five minutes. The duration of time required to stabilize the supply water, following the procedure in paragraph (h)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, is dependent on the reset strategy and may vary from model to model.

(*2*) Record the boiler supply water temperature while the temperature is stabilized.

(iii) *Establish high inferred load conditions at maximum boiler supply water temperature* - (A) *Establish high inferred load conditions.* Establish the inferred load conditions so that the supply water temperature is set to the maximum allowable supply water temperature as prescribed in the I&O manual, or if there is no recommendation, set to a temperature greater than 170 °F.

(B) *Supply water temperature stabilization at high inferred load.* (*1*) Maintain the call for heat until the boiler supply water temperature has stabilized. Temperature stabilization is deemed to be obtained when the boiler supply water temperature does not vary by more than ±3 °F over a period of five minutes. The duration of time required to stabilize the supply water, following the procedure in paragraph (h)(1)(iii)(A) of this section, is dependent on the reset strategy and may vary from model to model.

(*2*) Record the boiler supply water temperature while the temperature is stabilized.

(*3*) Terminate the call for heat.

(iv) [Reserved]

(2) *Test protocol for single-stage products employing burner delay.* This test will be used in place of paragraph (h)(1) of this section for products manufacturers have certified to DOE under § 429.18(b)(3) as employing a burner delay automatic means strategy. This test verifies whether the automatic means in single-stage boiler products establishes a burner delay upon a call for heat until the means has determined that the inferred heat load cannot be met by the residual heat of the water in the system.

(i) *Boiler setup* - (A) *Boiler installation.* Boiler installation in the test room shall be in accordance with the setup and apparatus requirements by section 6.0 of appendix N to subpart B of 10 CFR part 430.

(B) *Verify burner ignition.* At 15-second intervals, record time and supply water temperature until the main burner ignites.

(C) *Terminate the call for heat.*

(iv) [Reserved]

(i) *Pumps.* (1) The volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation of each tested unit of the basic model will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of § 431.464 of this chapter, where the value of volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation certified by the manufacturer will be treated as the expected BEP flow rate. The results of the measurement(s) will be compared to the value of volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation certified by the manufacturer. The certified volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation will be considered valid only if the measurement(s) (either the measured volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation for a single unit sample or the average of the measured flow rates for a multiple unit sample) is within five percent of the certified volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation.

(i) If the representative value of volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation is found to be valid, the measured volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation will be used in subsequent calculations of constant load pump energy rating (PERCL) and constant load pump energy index (PEICL) or variable load pump energy rating (PERVL) and variable load pump energy index (PEIVL) for that basic model.

(ii) If the representative value of volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation is found to be invalid, the mean of all the measured volume rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation values determined from the tested unit(s) will serve as the new expected BEP flow rate and the unit(s) will be retested until such time as the measured rate of flow (flow rate) at BEP and nominal speed of rotation is within 5 percent of the expected BEP flow rate.

(2) DOE will test each pump unit according to the test method specified by the manufacturer in the certification report submitted pursuant to § 429.59(b).

(j) *Refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines* - (1) *Verification of refrigerated volume.* The refrigerated volume (V) of each tested unit of the basic model will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of 10 CFR 431.296. The results of the measurement(s) will be compared to the representative value of refrigerated volume certified by the manufacturer. The certified refrigerated volume will be considered valid only if the measurement(s) (either the measured refrigerated volume for a single unit sample or the average of the measured refrigerated volumes for a multiple unit sample) is within five percent of the certified refrigerated volume.

(i) If the representative value of refrigerated volume is found to be valid, the certified refrigerated volume will be used as the basis for calculation of maximum daily energy consumption for the basic model.

(ii) If the representative value of refrigerated volume is found to be invalid, the average measured refrigerated volume determined from the tested unit(s) will serve as the basis for calculation of maximum daily energy consumption for the tested basic model.

(2) *Verification of surface area, transparent, and non-transparent areas.* The percent transparent surface area on the front side of the basic model will be measured pursuant to these requirements for the purposes of determining whether a given basic model meets the definition of Class A or Combination A, as presented at 10 CFR 431.292. The transparent and non-transparent surface areas shall be determined on the front side of the beverage vending machine at the outermost surfaces of the beverage vending machine cabinet, from edge to edge, excluding any legs or other protrusions that extend beyond the dimensions of the primary cabinet. Determine the transparent and non-transparent areas on each side of a beverage vending machine as described in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. For combination vending machines, disregard the surface area surrounding any refrigerated compartments that are not designed to be refrigerated (as demonstrated by the presence of temperature controls), whether or not it is transparent. Determine the percent transparent surface area on the front side of the beverage vending machine as a ratio of the measured transparent area on that side divided by the sum of the measured transparent and non-transparent areas, multiplying the result by 100.

(*i*) *Determination of transparent area.* Determine the total surface area that is transparent as the sum of all surface areas on the front side of a beverage vending machine that meet the definition of transparent at 10 CFR 431.292. When determining whether or not a particular wall segment is transparent, transparency should be determined for the aggregate performance of all the materials between the refrigerated volume and the ambient environment; the composite performance of all those materials in a particular wall segment must meet the definition of transparent for that area be treated as transparent.

(*ii*) *Determination of non-transparent area.* Determine the total surface area that is not transparent as the sum of all surface areas on the front side of a beverage vending machine that are not considered part of the transparent area, as determined in accordance with paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this section.

(k) *Central air conditioners and heat pumps* - (1) *Verification of cooling capacity.* The cooling capacity of each tested unit of the individual model (for single-package systems) or individual combination (for split systems) will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of § 430.23(m) of this chapter. The mean of the measurement(s) (either the measured cooling capacity for a single unit sample or the average of the measured cooling capacities for a multiple unit sample) will be used to determine the applicable standards for purposes of compliance.

(2) *Verification of C*D value. (i) For central air conditioners and heat pumps other than models of outdoor units with no match, if manufacturers certify that they did not conduct the optional tests to determine the Cc and/or Ch value for an individual model (for single-package systems) or individual combination (for split systems), as applicable, the default Cc and/or Ch value will be used as the basis for calculation of SEER or HSPF for each unit tested. If manufacturers certify that they conducted the optional tests to determine the Cc and/or Ch value for an individual model (for single-package systems) or individual combination (for split systems), as applicable, the Cc and/or Ch value will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of § 430.23(m) of this chapter for each unit tested and the result for each unit tested (either the tested value or the default value, as selected according to the criteria for the cyclic test in 10 CFR part 430, subpart B, appendix M, section 3.5e) used as the basis for calculation of SEER or HSPF for that unit.

(ii) For models of outdoor units with no match, DOE will use the default Cc and/or Ch value pursuant to 10 CFR part 430.

(l) *Miscellaneous refrigeration products* - (1) *Verification of total refrigerated volume.* For all miscellaneous refrigeration products, the total refrigerated volume of the basic model will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of part 430 of this chapter for each unit tested. The results of the measurement(s) will be averaged and compared to the value of total refrigerated volume certified by the manufacturer. The certified total refrigerated volume will be considered valid only if:

(i) The measurement is within two percent, or 0.5 cubic feet (0.2 cubic feet for products with total refrigerated volume less than 7.75 cubic feet (220 liters)), whichever is greater, of the certified total refrigerated volume; or

(ii) The measurement is greater than the certified total refrigerated volume.

(A) If the certified total refrigerated volume is found to be valid, the certified adjusted total volume will be used as the basis for calculating the maximum allowed energy use for the tested basic model.

(B) If the certified total refrigerated volume is found to be invalid, the average measured adjusted total volume, rounded to the nearest 0.1 cubic foot, will serve as the basis for calculating the maximum allowed energy use for the tested basic model.

(2) *Test for models with two compartments, each having its own user-operable temperature control.* The test described in section 3.3 of the applicable test procedure in appendix A to subpart B part 430 of this chapter shall be used for all units of a tested basic model before DOE makes a determination of noncompliance with respect to the basic model.

(m) *Commercial packaged boilers* - (1) *Verification of fuel input rate.* The fuel input rate of each tested unit will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of § 431.86 of this chapter. The results of the measurement(s) will be compared to the value of rated input certified by the manufacturer. The certified rated input will be considered valid only if the measurement(s) (either the measured fuel input rate for a single unit sample or the average of the measured fuel input rates for a multiple unit sample) is within two percent of the certified rated input.

(i) If the measured fuel input rate is within two-percent of the certified rated input, the certified rated input will serve as the basis for determination of the appropriate equipment class(es) and the mean measured fuel input rate will be used as the basis for calculation of combustion and/or thermal efficiency for the basic model.

(ii) If the measured fuel input rate for a gas-fired commercial packaged boiler is not within two-percent of the certified rated input, DOE will first attempt to increase or decrease the gas manifold pressure within the range specified in manufacturer's installation and operation manual shipped with the commercial packaged boiler being tested (or, if not provided in the manual, in supplemental instructions provided by the manufacturer pursuant to § 429.60(b)(4) of this chapter) to achieve the certified rated input (within two-percent). If the fuel input rate is still not within two-percent of the certified rated input, DOE will attempt to increase or decrease the gas inlet pressure within the range specified in manufacturer's installation and operation manual shipped with the commercial packaged boiler being tested (or, if not provided in the manual, in supplemental instructions provided by the manufacturer pursuant to § 429.60(b)(4)) to achieve the certified rated input (within two-percent). If the fuel input rate is still not within two-percent of the certified rated input, DOE will attempt to modify the gas inlet orifice if the unit is equipped with one. If the fuel input rate still is not within two percent of the certified rated input, the mean measured fuel input rate (either for a single unit sample or the average of the measured fuel input rates for a multiple unit sample) will serve as the basis for determination of the appropriate equipment class(es) and calculation of combustion and/or thermal efficiency for the basic model.

(iii) If the measured fuel input rate for an oil-fired commercial packaged boiler is not within two-percent of the certified rated input, the mean measured fuel input rate (either for a single unit sample or the average of the measured fuel input rates for a multiple unit sample) will serve as the basis for determination of the appropriate equipment class(es) and calculation of combustion and/or thermal efficiency for the basic model.

(2) *Models capable of producing both hot water and steam.* For a model of commercial packaged boiler that is capable of producing both hot water and steam, DOE may measure the thermal or combustion efficiency as applicable (see § 431.87 of this chapter) for steam and/or hot water modes. DOE will evaluate compliance based on the measured thermal or combustion efficiency in steam and hot water modes, independently.

(n) *Commercial water heating equipment other than residential-duty commercial water heaters* - (1) *Verification of fuel input rate.* The fuel input rate of each tested unit of the basic model will be measured pursuant to the test requirements of § 431.106 of this chapter. The measured fuel input rate (either the measured fuel input rate for a single unit sample or the average of the measured fuel input rates for a multiple unit sample) will be compared to the rated input certified by the manufacturer. The certified rated input will be considered valid only if the measured fuel input rate is within two percent of the certified rated input.

(i) If the certified rated input is found to be valid, then the certified rated input will serve as the basis for determination of the appropriate equipment class and calculation of the standby loss standard (as applicable).

(ii) If the measured fuel input rate for gas-fired commercial water heating equipment is not within two percent of the certified rated input, DOE will first attempt to increase or decrease the gas outlet pressure within 10 percent of the value specified on the nameplate of the model of commercial water heating equipment being tested to achieve the certified rated input (within 2 percent). If the fuel input rate is still not within two percent of the certified rated input, DOE will attempt to increase or decrease the gas supply pressure within the range specified on the nameplate of the model of commercial water heating equipment being tested. If the measured fuel input rate is still not within two percent of the certified rated input, DOE will attempt to modify the gas inlet orifice, if the unit is equipped with one. If the measured fuel input rate still is not within two percent of the certified rated input, the measured fuel input rate will serve as the basis for determination of the appropriate equipment class and calculation of the standby loss standard (as applicable).

(iii) If the measured fuel input rate for oil-fired commercial water heating equipment is not within two percent of the certified rated input, the measured fuel input rate will serve as the basis for determination of the appropriate equipment class and calculation of the standby loss standard (as applicable).
