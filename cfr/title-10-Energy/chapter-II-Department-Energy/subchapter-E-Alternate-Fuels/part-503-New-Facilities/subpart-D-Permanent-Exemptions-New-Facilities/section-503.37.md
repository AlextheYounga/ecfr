Data are based upon 1987 oil, natural gas and electricity statistics published by DOE's Energy Information Administration.Example:The proposed cogeneration project is to be located in Massachusetts and is to use distillate oil. It will have a capacity of 50 MW, an average annual heat rate of 7600 BTU/KWHR, and be operated at a capacity factor of 90%. The annual fuel consumption is therefore calculated to be 2,996 × 109 Btu/yr. (50,000 KW × 7600 BTU/KWHR × .9 × 8760 HR/YR) The oil and gas backed off the grid would be calculated to be .2070 × 109 BTU/YR. (50,000 KW × 5250 BTU/KWHR × .9 × 8760 HR/YR) since the proposed unit would consume more oil that would be “backed off” the grid, the unit would not be eligible for a permanent exemption based on savings of oil and natural gas.[54 FR 52895, Dec. 22, 1989]
