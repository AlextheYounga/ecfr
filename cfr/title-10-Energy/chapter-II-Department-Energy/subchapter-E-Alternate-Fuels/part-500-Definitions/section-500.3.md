##### § 500.3 Electric regions—electric region groupings for reliability measurements under the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978. #####

(a) The following is a list of electric regions for use with regard to the Act. The regions are identified by FERC Power Supply Areas (PSA's) as authorized by section 202(a) of the Federal Power Act except where noted. They will be reviewed annually by ERA. Each grouping meets one or more of the following criteria:

(1) Existing centrally dispatched pools and hourly power brokers;

(2) Systems with joint planning and construction agreements;

(3) Systems with coordination agreements in the areas of:

(i) Generation reserve and system reliability criteria;

(ii) Capacity and energy exchange policies;

(iii) Maintenance scheduling; and

(iv) Emergency procedures for dealing with capacity or fuel shortages; or

(4) Systems within the same National Electric Reliability Council (NERC) region with historical coordination policies.

(b) The PSA's referred to in the definition of electric regions in paragraph (a) of this section were first defined by the Federal Power Commission in 1936. The most recent reference to them is given in the *1970 National Power Survey,* Vol. 1, Pg. 1-3-16. In cases where a petitioner finds an ambiguity in a regional assignment, he shall consult with DOE for an official determination.
