##### ยง 609.18 Deviations. #####

To the extent that such requirements are not specified by the Act or other applicable statutes, DOE may authorize deviations on an individual request basis from the requirements of this part upon a finding that such deviation is essential to program objectives and the special circumstances stated in the request make such deviation clearly in the best interest of the Government. DOE will consult with OMB and the Secretary of the Treasury before DOE grants any deviation that would constitute a substantial change in the financial terms of the Loan Guarantee Agreement and related documents. Any deviation, however, that was not captured in the Credit Subsidy Cost will require either additional fees or discretionary appropriations. A recommendation for any deviation shall be submitted in writing to DOE. Such recommendation must include a supporting statement, which indicates briefly the nature of the deviation requested and the reasons in support thereof.
