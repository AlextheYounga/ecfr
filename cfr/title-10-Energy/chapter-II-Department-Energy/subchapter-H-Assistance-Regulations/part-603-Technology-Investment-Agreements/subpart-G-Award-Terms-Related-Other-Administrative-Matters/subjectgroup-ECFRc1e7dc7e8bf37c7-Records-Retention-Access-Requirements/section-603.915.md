##### § 603.915 Access to a nonprofit participant's records. #####

A TIA must include for any nonprofit participant the standard access-to-records requirement at:

(a) 10 CFR 600.242(e), for a participant that is a State or local governmental organization;

(b) 10 CFR 600.153(e), for a participant that is a nonprofit organization. The same requirement applies to any GOCO or FFRDC, even though nonprofit GOCOs and FFRDCs are exempted from the definition of “recipient” in 10 CFR 600.101.
