##### ยง 708.14 How much time does an employee have to file a complaint? #####

(a) You must file your complaint by the 90th day after the date you knew, or reasonably should have known, of the alleged retaliation.

(b) The period for filing a complaint does not include time spent attempting to resolve the dispute through an internal company grievance-arbitration procedure. The time period for filing stops running on the day the internal grievance is filed and begins to run again on the earlier of:

(1) The day after such dispute resolution efforts end; or

(2) 150 days after the internal grievance was filed if a final decision on the grievance has not been issued.

(c) The period for filing a complaint does not include time spent resolving jurisdictional issues related to a complaint you file under State or other applicable law. The time period for filing stops running on the date the complaint under State or other applicable law is filed and begins to run again the day after a final decision on the jurisdictional issues is issued.

(d) If you do not file your complaint during the 90-day period, the Head of Field Element or EC Director (as applicable) will give you an opportunity to show any good reason you may have for not filing within that period, and that official may, in his or her discretion, accept your complaint for processing.
