##### § 766.102 Calculation methodology. #####

(a) *Calculation of Domestic Utilities' Annual Assessment Ratio to the Fund.* Domestic utilities shall be assessed annually for their share of the Fund. The amount of the assessment shall be determined by the ratio of SWUs produced by DOE and purchased by domestic utilities prior to October 24, 1992, to the total number of SWUs produced by DOE for all purposes (including SWUs produced for defense purposes). All calculations will be carried out to the fifth significant digit. This ratio is expressed by the following hypothetical example:

|SWUs purchased by all domestic utilities|   |Total SWUs produced—all purposes|   |Special assessment ratio|
|----------------------------------------|---|--------------------------------|---|------------------------|
|                 12345                  | ÷ |             45678              |\= |         .27026         |

(b) *Calculation of the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment for Domestic Utilities.* The Annual Special Assessment ratio calculated in paragraph (a) of this section shall be multiplied by $480 million, yielding the total amount of the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment as of October 1992. In the event that this amount is in excess of $150 million, the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment shall be capped at $150 million. All calculations will be carried out to the fifth significant digit. The Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment is determined as shown in the following hypothetical example:

| Total fund |   |Annual assessment ratio|   |Baseline total annual special assessment|
|------------|---|-----------------------|---|----------------------------------------|
|$480,000,000| × |        0.27026        |\= |              $129,724,800              |

(c) *Calculation of Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment per Utility.* The ratio of the total number of SWUs purchased by an individual domestic utility for commercial electricity generation, to the total number of SWUs purchased by all domestic utilities for commercial electricity generation, multiplied by the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment calculated in paragraph (b) of this section, determines an individual utility's share of the Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment. All calculations will be carried out to the fifth significant digit. A hypothetical example of such a calculation follows:

|Single utility SWUs|   |All utility SWUs|   |Utility ratio|   |Baseline total annual special assessment|Individual utility special Assessment|
|-------------------|---|----------------|---|-------------|---|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
|        300        | ÷ |     12345      |\= |   .02430    | × |              $129,724,800              |            $3,152,312.64            |

(d) *Calculation of Inflation Adjustment.* The Baseline Total Annual Special Assessment billed to domestic utilities shall be adjusted for inflation using the most recently published monthly CPI-U and the CPI-U for October 1992. All calculations will be carried out to the fifth significant digit. A hypothetical example of such a calculation follows:

|CPI-U (Mar 93)|   |CPI-U (Oct 92)|   |Adjustment multiplier|
|--------------|---|--------------|---|---------------------|
|     150      | ÷ |    141.8     |\= |       1.05783       |

|Utility special Assessment|   |Adjustment multiplier|   |Adjusted utility assessment|
|--------------------------|---|---------------------|---|---------------------------|
|      $3,152,312.64       | × |       1.05783       |\= |       $3,334,610.88       |
