##### ยง 1.21 Compilation of new records. #####

Nothing in 5 U.S.C. 552 or this subpart requires that any agency create a new record in order to fulfill a request for records. However, an agency is required to provide a record in a form or format specified by a requester, if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in the form or format requested. Creation of records may be undertaken voluntarily if the agency determines this action to be in the public interest or the interest of USDA.
