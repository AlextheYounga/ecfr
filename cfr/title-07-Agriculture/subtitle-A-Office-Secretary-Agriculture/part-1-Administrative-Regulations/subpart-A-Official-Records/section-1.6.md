##### ยง 1.6 Aggregating requests. #####

When an agency reasonably believes that a requester, or a group of requesters acting in concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requests for the purpose of evading the assessment of fees, the agency may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly. One element that may be considered in determining whether such a belief would be reasonable is the brevity of the time period during which the requests have been made.
