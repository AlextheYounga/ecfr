##### § 1.15 General provisions respecting release of records. #####

(a) When releasing documents, agencies shall provide the record in any form or format the requester specifies, if the record is readily reproducible in that form of format. Agencies shall make reasonable efforts to maintain their records in forms or formats that are reproducible. In responding to requests for records, agencies shall make reasonable efforts to search for records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of an agency's automated information system. Such determinations shall be made on a case-by-case basis.

(b) In the event a requested record contains some portions that are exempt from mandatory disclosure and others that are not, the official responding to the request shall ensure that all reasonably segregable nonexempt portions are disclosed, and that all exempt portions are identified according to the specific exemption or exemptions which are applicable. The amount of deleted information shall be indicated on the released portion of paper records. Deletions may be marked by use of brackets or darkened areas indicating removal of information, or by any other method that would reasonable demonstrate the extent of the deletion. In the case of electronic deletion, or deletion in audiovisual or microfiche records, if technically feasible, the amount of redacted information shall be indicated at the place in the records, if technically feasible, the amount of redacted information shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion was made. This may be done by use of brackets, shaded areas, or some other identifiable technique which will clearly show the limits of the deleted information.

(c) If, in connection with a request or an appeal, a charge is to be made in accordance with sec. 8 of appendix A to this subpart, agencies shall inform the requester of the fee amount and of the basis for the charge. Each agency, in accordance with sec. 8 of appendix A to this subpart, may require payment of the entire fee, or a portion of the fee, before it provides the requested records. An agency shall require full payment of any delinquent fee owed by the requester plus any applicable interest prior to releasing records on a subsequent request or appeal. If a requester refuses to remit payment in advance, an agency may refuse to process the request or appeal with written notice to that effect forwarded to the requester. The “date of receipt” appeal for which advance payment has been required shall be the date that payment is received.

(d) In the event compliance with the request or appeal involves inspection of records by the requester rather than providing copies of the records, the agency response shall include the name, mailing address, and telephone number of the person to be contacted to arrange a mutually convenient time for such inspection.

(e) Whenever duplication fees, or search fees for unsuccessful searches (see sec. 4(f) of appendix A to this subpart), are anticipated to exceed $25.00, and the requester has not indicated, in advance, a willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated, agencies shall notify the requester of the amount of the anticipated fee. If an extensive and therefore costly successful search is anticipated, agencies also should notify requesters of the anticipated fees. The notification shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with agency personnel to reform the request to meet the requester's needs at a lower fee. In appropriate cases, an advance deposit in accordance with sec. 8 of appendix A to this subpart may be required.
