He or she shall also specify, if that is known, the nature of the judicial or administrative proceeding and the nature of the testimony or documents requested.

(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an employee of USDA only may appear as a witness or produce records on behalf of a party other than the United States in a judicial or administrative proceeding in which the United States is a party if such appearance or production has been ordered by the service on the employee of a valid summons, subpoena, or other compulsory process issued by a court, administrative agency, or other official authorized to compel his or her appearance.

(2) An employee requested to appear as a witness or produce records on behalf of a party other than the United States in a judicial or administrative proceeding in which the United States is a party, without being served a valid summons, subpoena, or other compulsory process, may appear or produce records only if such appearance or production has been authorized by a representative of the Department of Justice, the United States Attorney, or other counsel who is representing the United States in the case of a judicial proceeding; or by the official or attorney representing the United States, in the case of an administrative proceeding.

(c) The head of the USDA agency shall consult with the General Counsel or his or her designee as to whether there are grounds to oppose the employee's attendance or production of documents and, if so, whether to seek to quash the summons, subpoena, compulsory process, or to deny authorization under paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(d) As appropriate, the General Counsel or his or her designee will request the assistance of the Department of Justice, a United States Attorney, or other counsel representing the United States, in the case of a judicial proceeding; or of the official or attorney representing the United States, in the case of an administrative proceeding, to represent the interest of the employee and USDA.

(e) If there is any question regarding the validity of a summons, subpoena, or other compulsory process, an employee shall contact the Office of the General Counsel for advice.
