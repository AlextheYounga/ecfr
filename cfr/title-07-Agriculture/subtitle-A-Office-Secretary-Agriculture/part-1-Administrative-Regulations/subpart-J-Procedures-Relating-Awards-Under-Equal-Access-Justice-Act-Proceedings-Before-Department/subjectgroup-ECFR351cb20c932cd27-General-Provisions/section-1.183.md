(a)(1) The rules in this subpart apply to adversary adjudications. These are:

(i) Adjudications required by statute to be conducted by the Department under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position of the Department or any other agency of the United States, or any component of an agency, is presented by an attorney or other representative who enters an appearance and participates in the proceeding,

(ii) Appeals of decisions of contracting officers made pursuant to section 6 of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 605) before the Agriculture Board of Contract Appeals as provided in section 8 of that Act (41 U.S.C. 607), and

(iii) Any hearing conducted under chapter 38 of title 31, United States Code.

(2) Any proceeding in which the Department may prescribe a lawful present or future rate is not covered by EAJA. Proceedings to grant or renew licenses also are excluded, but proceedings to modify, suspend, or revoke licenses are covered if they are otherwise “adversary adjudications.” The proceedings covered include adversary adjudications under the following statutory provisions.

(c) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by EAJA and matters specifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only fees and expenses related to covered issues.
