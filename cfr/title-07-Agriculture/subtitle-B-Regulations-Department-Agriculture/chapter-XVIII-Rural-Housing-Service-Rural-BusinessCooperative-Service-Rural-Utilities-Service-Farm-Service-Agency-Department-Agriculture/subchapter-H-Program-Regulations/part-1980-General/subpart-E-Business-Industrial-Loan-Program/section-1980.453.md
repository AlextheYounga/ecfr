##### § 1980.453 Review of requirements. #####

(a) Immediately after reviewing the conditions and requirements in Form RD 449-14 the lender and applicant should complete and sign the “Acceptance of Conditions,” and return a copy to the Rural Development State Director. If certain conditions cannot be met, the lender and borrower may propose alternate conditions to Rural Development.

(b) If the lender indicates in the “Acceptance of Conditions” that it desires to obtain a Loan Note Guarantee and subsequently decides at any time after receiving a conditional commitment that it no longer wants a Loan Note Guarantee, the lender will immediately advise the Rural Development State Director.

Administrative

A. The State Director will negotiate with the lender and proposed borrower any changes made to the initially issued or proposed Form RD 449-14. For loans requiring National Office concurrence, a copy of Form RD 449-14 and any amendments thereto will be included when the loan file is submitted to the National Office for review. When the National Office recommends modifications or additions to Form RD 449-14, the State Director will further negotiate these recommendations with the lender and proposed borrower. If, as a result of these further negotiations, the lender, proposed borrower or State Director presents alternate conditions which would result in a change in the scope of the proposed project and if the loan exceeds the State Director's loan approval authority, the State Director will submit these conditions by memorandum to the National Office for consideration with a copy of the revised Form RD 449-14 and any amendments thereto. If the loan is within the State Director's loan approval authority, the State Director may approve such changes.
