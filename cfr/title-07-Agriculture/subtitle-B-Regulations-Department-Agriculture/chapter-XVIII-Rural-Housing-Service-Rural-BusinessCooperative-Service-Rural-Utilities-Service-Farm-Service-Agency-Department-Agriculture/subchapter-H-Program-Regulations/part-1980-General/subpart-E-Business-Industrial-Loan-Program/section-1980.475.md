##### § 1980.475 Bankruptcy. #####

(a) It is the lender's responsibility to protect the guaranteed loan debt and all the collateral securing it in bankruptcy proceedings. These responsibilities include but are not limited to the following:

(1) The lender will file a proof of claim where necessary and all the necessary papers and pleadings concerning the case.

(2) The lender will attend and where necessary participate in meetings of the creditors and all court proceedings.

(3) The lender, whose collateral is subject to being used by the trustee in bankruptcy, will immediately seek adequate protection of the collateral.

(4) Where appropriate, the lender should seek involuntary conversion of a pending Chapter 11 case to a liquidating proceeding under Chapter 7 or under Section 1123(b) (4) or seek dismissal of the proceedings.

(5) When permitted by the Bankruptcy Code, the lender will request modification of any plan of reorganization whenever it appears that additional recoveries are likely.

(6) Rural Development will be kept adequately and regularly informed in writing of all aspects of the proceedings.

(b) In a Chapter 11 reorganization, if an independent appraisal of collateral is necessary in Rural Development's opinion, Rural Development and the lender will share such appraisal fee equally.

(c) Expenses on Chapter 11 reorganization, liquidating Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 (unless the lender is directly handling the liquidation) cases are not to be deducted from the collateral proceeds.

(d) *Estimated loss payments.* See paragraph XVI of Form RD 449-35.

Administrative

Refer to appendix G of this subpart (available in any Rural Development office) for advice on how to interact with the lender on liquidation and property management.

A. It is the responsibility of the State Program Chief to see that Rural Development is being fully informed by the lender in all bankruptcy cases.

B. All bankruptcy cases should be reported immediately to the National Office by utilizing and completing a problem/delinquent status report. The Regional Attorney must be informed promptly of the proceedings.

C. Chapter 11 pertains to a reorganization of a business contemplating an ongoing business rather than a termination and dissolution of the business where legal protection is afforded to the business as defined under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Consequently, expenses incurred by the lender in a Chapter 11 reorganization can never be liquidation expenses unless the proceeding becomes a Liquidating 11. If the proceeding should become a Liquidating 11, reasonable and customary liquidation expenses may be deducted from proceeds of collateral provided the lender is doing the actual liquidation of the collateral as provided by the Lender's Agreement. Chapter 7 pertains to a liquidation of the borrower's assets. If and when liquidation of the borrower's assets under Chapter 7 is conducted by the bankruptcy trustee, the lender cannot claim expenses.

D. The State Director may approve the repurchase of the unpaid guaranteed portion of the loan from the holder(s) to reduce interest accruals during Chapter 7 proceedings or after a Chapter 11 proceeding becomes a liquidation proceeding. On loans in bankruptcy, any loss payment must be halted in accordance with the Lender's Agreement and carry the approval of the State Director.

E. The State Director must approve in advance and in writing the lender's estimated liquidation expenses on loans in liquidation bankruptcy. These expenses must be reasonable and customary and not in-house expenses of the lender.

F. The lender is responsible for advising Rural Development of the completion of the Chapter 11 reorganization plan; however, the Rural Development servicing office will monitor the lender's files to ensure timely notification of servicing actions.

G. If an estimated loss claim is paid during the operation of the reorganization plan, and the borrower repays in full the remaining balance of the loan as set forth in the plan without an additional loss sustained by the lender, a Final Report of Loss is not necessary. The Finance Office will close out the estimated loss account as a Final Loss at the time notification of payment in full is received.

H. If the bankruptcy court attempts to direct that loss payments will be applied to the account other than the unsecured principal first and then to unsecured accrued interest, the lender is responsible for notifying the Rural Development servicing office immediately. The Rural Development servicing office will then obtain advice from OGC on what actions Rural Development should take.

I. Protective Advances—Authorized protective advances may be included with the estimated loss payment associated with the Chapter 11 reorganization provided they were incurred in connection with liquidation of the account prior to the borrower filing bankruptcy.

J. Adequate Protection—The bankruptcy court can order protection of the collateral while the borrower is in a reorganization bankruptcy. The lender whose collateral is subject to being used by the trustee in bankruptcy should immediately seek adequate protection of the collateral, including petitioning for a super priority.
