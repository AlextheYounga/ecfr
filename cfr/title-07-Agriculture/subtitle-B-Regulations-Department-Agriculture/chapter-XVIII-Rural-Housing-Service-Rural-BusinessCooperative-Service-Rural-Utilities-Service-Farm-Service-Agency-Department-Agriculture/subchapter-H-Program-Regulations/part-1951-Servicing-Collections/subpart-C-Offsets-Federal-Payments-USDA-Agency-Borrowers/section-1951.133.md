##### ยง 1951.133 Establishment of Federal Debt. #####

Any amounts paid by RBS on account of liabilities of a business and industry (B&I) program guaranteed loan borrower will constitute a Federal debt owing to RBS by the B&I guaranteed loan borrower. In such case, the RBS may use all remedies available to it, including offset under the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), to collect the debt from the borrower. Interest charges will be established at the note rate of the guaranteed loan on the date a loss claim is paid. RBS may, at its option, refer such debt in all or part to the Department of the Treasury, before a final loss claim is determined.
