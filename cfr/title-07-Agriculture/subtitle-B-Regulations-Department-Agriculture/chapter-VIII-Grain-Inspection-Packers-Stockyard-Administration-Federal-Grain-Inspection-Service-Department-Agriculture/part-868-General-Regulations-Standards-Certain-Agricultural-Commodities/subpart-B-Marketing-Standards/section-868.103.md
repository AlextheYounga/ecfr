##### ยง 868.103 Public notification of grade standards action. #####

(a) After developing a standardization proposal, GIPSA will publish a notice in the Federal Register proposing new or revised standards or suspending or terminating existing standards. The notice will provide a sufficient comment period for interested parties to submit comments.

(b) GIPSA will simultaneously issue a news release about these actions, notifying the affected industry and general public. GIPSA will also distribute copies of proposals to anyone requesting a copy or to anyone it believes may be interested, including other Federal, State, or local government agencies.

(c) All comments received within the comment period will be made part of the public record maintained by GIPSA, will be available to the public for review, and will be considered by GIPSA before final action is taken on the proposal.

(d) Based on the comments received, GIPSA's knowledge of standards, grading, marketing, and other technical factors, and any other relevant information, GIPSA will decide whether the proposed actions should be implemented.

(e) If GIPSA concludes that the changes as proposed or with appropriate modifications should be adopted, GIPSA will publish the final changes in the Federal Register as a final notice. GIPSA will make the grade standards and related information available in printed form and electronic media.

(f) If GIPSA determines that proposed changes are not warranted, or otherwise are not in the public interest, GIPSA will either publish in the Federal Register a notice withdrawing the proposal, or will revise the proposal and again seek public input.
