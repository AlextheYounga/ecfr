(7) “Brewers milled rice” shall consist of milled rice which, when determined in accordance with § 868.303, contains not more than 25.0 percent of whole kernels and which does not meet the kernel-size requirements for the class Second Head Milled Rice or Screenings Milled Rice.

(e) *Damaged kernels.* Whole or broken kernels of rice which are distinctly discolored or damaged by water, insects, heat, or any other means, and parboiled kernels in nonparboiled rice. “Heat-damaged kernels” (see paragraph (g) of this section) shall not function as damaged kernels.

(f) *Foreign material.* All matter other than rice and seeds. Hulls, germs, and bran which have separated from the kernels of rice shall be considered foreign material.

(g) *Heat-damaged kernels.* Whole or broken kernels of rice which are materially discolored and damaged as a result of heating and parboiled kernels in nonparboiled rice which are as dark as, or darker in color than, the interpretive line for heat-damaged kernels.

(h) *Objectionable seeds.* Seeds other than rice, except seeds of *Echinochloa crusgalli* (commonly known as barnyard grass, watergrass, and Japanese millet).

(i) *Other types.* (1) Whole kernels of: (i) Long grain rice in medium or short grain rice, (ii) medium grain rice in long or short grain rice, (iii) Short grain rice in long or medium grain rice, and (2) broken kernels of long grain rice in medium or short grain rice and broken kernels of medium or short grain rice in long grain rice, except in U.S. No. 5 and U.S. No. 6 milled rice. In U.S. No. 5 and U.S. No. 6 milled rice, only whole kernels will apply.

Note:

Broken kernels of medium grain rice in short grain rice and broken kernels of short grain rice in medium grain rice shall not be considered other types.

(j) *Paddy Kernels.* Whole or broken unhulled kernels of rice; whole or broken kernels of brown rice, and whole or broken kernels of milled rice having a portion or portions of the hull remaining which cover one-eighth (1/8) or more of the whole or broken kernel.

(l) *Seeds.* Whole or broken seeds of any plant other than rice.

(m) *Types of rice.* There are three types of milled rice as follows:

Long grain.Medium grain.Short grain.Types shall be based on the length-width ratio of kernels of rice that are unbroken and the width, thickness, and shape of kernels that are broken, prescribed in FGIS instructions.

(n) *Ungelatinized kernels.* Whole or broken kernels of parboiled rice with distinct white or chalky areas due to incomplete gelatinization of the starch.
