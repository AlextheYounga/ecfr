##### § 990.1 Meaning of terms. #####

Words used in this subpart in the singular form shall be deemed to impart the plural, and vice versa, as the case may demand. For the purposes of provisions and regulations of this part, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall be construed, respectively, to mean:

*Acceptable hemp THC level.* When a laboratory tests a sample, it must report the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis and the measurement of uncertainty. The acceptable hemp THC level for the purpose of compliance with the requirements of State, Tribal, or USDA hemp plans is when the application of the measurement of uncertainty to the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis produces a distribution or range that includes 0.3% or less. For example, if the reported delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis is 0.35% and the measurement of uncertainty is ±0.06%, the measured delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level on a dry weight basis for this sample ranges from 0.29% to 0.41%. Because 0.3% is within the distribution or range, the sample is within the acceptable hemp THC level for the purpose of plan compliance. This definition of “acceptable hemp THC level” affects neither the statutory definition of hemp, 7 U.S.C. 1639o(1), in the 2018 Farm Bill nor the definition of “marihuana,” 21 U.S.C. 802(16), in the CSA.

*Act.* Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946.

*Agricultural Marketing Service* or *AMS.* The Agricultural Marketing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

*Applicant.* An applicant is:

(1) A State or Indian Tribe that has submitted a State or Tribal hemp production plan to USDA for approval under this part; or

(2) A producer in a State or territory of an Indian Tribe who is not subject to a State or Tribal hemp production plan and who has submitted an application for a license under the USDA hemp production plan under this part.

*Cannabis.* A genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae of which *Cannabis sativa* is a species, and *Cannabis indica* and *Cannabis ruderalis* are subspecies thereof. Cannabis refers to any form of the plant in which the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration on a dry weight basis has not yet been determined.

*Controlled Substances Act (CSA).* The Controlled Substances Act as codified in 21 U.S.C. 801 *et seq.*

*Conviction.* Means any plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or any finding of guilt, except when the finding of guilt is subsequently overturned on appeal, pardoned, or expunged. For purposes of this part, a conviction is expunged when the conviction is removed from the individual's criminal history record and there are no legal disabilities or restrictions associated with the expunged conviction, other than the fact that the conviction may be used for sentencing purposes for subsequent convictions. In addition, where an individual is allowed to withdraw an original plea of guilty or nolo contendere and enter a plea of not guilty and the case is subsequently dismissed, the individual is no longer considered to have a conviction for purposes of this part.

*Corrective action plan.* A plan established by a State, Tribal government, or USDA for a licensed hemp producer to correct a negligent violation or non-compliance with a hemp production plan and this part.

*Criminal History Report.* Criminal history report means the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Identity History Summary.

*Culpable mental state greater than negligence.* To act intentionally, knowingly, willfully, or recklessly.

*Decarboxylated.* The completion of the chemical reaction that converts THC-acid (THC-A) into delta-9-THC, the intoxicating component of cannabis. The decarboxylated value is also calculated using a conversion formula that sums delta-9-THC and eighty-seven and seven tenths (87.7) percent of THC-acid.

*Decarboxylation.* The removal or elimination of carboxyl group from a molecule or organic compound.

*Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol* or *THC.* Delta-9-THC is the primary psychoactive component of cannabis. For the purposes of this part, delta-9-THC and THC are interchangeable.

*Drug Enforcement Administration or DEA.* The United States Drug Enforcement Administration.

*Dry weight basis.* The ratio of the amount of moisture in a sample to the amount of dry solid in a sample. A basis for expressing the percentage of a chemical in a substance after removing the moisture from the substance. Percentage of THC on a dry weight basis means the percentage of THC, by weight, in a cannabis item (plant, extract, or other derivative), after excluding moisture from the item.

*Entity.* A corporation, joint stock company, association, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, irrevocable trust, estate, charitable organization, or other similar organization, including any such organization participating in the hemp production as a partner in a general partnership, a participant in a joint venture, or a participant in a similar organization.

*Farm Service Agency* or *FSA.* An agency of the United States Department of Agriculture.

*Gas chromatography* or *GC.* A type of chromatography in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. GC relies on heat for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition.

*Geospatial location.* For the purposes of this part, “geospatial location” means a location designated through a global system of navigational satellites used to determine the precise ground position of a place or object.

*Handle.* To harvest or store hemp plants or hemp plant parts prior to the delivery of such plants or plant parts for further processing. “Handle” also includes the disposal of cannabis plants that are not hemp for purposes of chemical analysis and disposal of such plants.

*Hemp.* The plant species *Cannabis sativa* L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts, and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis.

*High-performance liquid chromatography* or *HPLC.* A type of chromatography technique in analytical chemistry used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. HPLC relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material to separate and analyze compounds.

*Indian Tribe.* As defined in section 4 of the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5304).

*Information sharing system.* The database mandated under the Act which allows USDA to share information collected under State, Tribal, and USDA plans with Federal, State, Tribal, and local law enforcement.

*Key participants.* A sole proprietor, a partner in partnership, or a person with executive managerial control in a corporation. A person with executive managerial control includes persons such as a chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer. This definition does not include non-executive managers such as farm, field, or shift managers.

*Law enforcement agency.* Any Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency.

*Lot.* A contiguous area in a field, greenhouse, or indoor growing structure containing the same variety or strain of cannabis throughout the area.

*Marijuana.* As defined in the CSA, “marihuana” means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. The term `marihuana' does not include hemp, as defined in section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, and does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination (7 U.S.C. 1639o). “Marihuana” means all cannabis that tests as having a concentration level of THC on a dry weight basis of higher than 0.3 percent.

*Measurement of Uncertainty (MU).* The parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the particular quantity subject to measurement.

*Negligence.* Failure to exercise the level of care that a reasonably prudent person would exercise in complying with the regulations set forth under this part.

*Phytocannabinoid.* Cannabinoid chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant, two of which are Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9 THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).

*Plan.* A set of criteria or regulations under which a State or Tribal government, or USDA, monitors and regulates the production of hemp.

*Postdecarboxylation.* In the context of testing methodologies for THC concentration levels in hemp, means a value determined after the process of decarboxylation that determines the total potential delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content derived from the sum of the THC and THC-A content and reported on a dry weight basis. The postdecarboxylation value of THC can be calculated by using a chromatograph technique using heat, gas chromatography, through which THCA is converted from its acid form to its neutral form, THC. Thus, this test calculates the total potential THC in a given sample. The postdecarboxylation value of THC can also be calculated by using a high-performance liquid chromatograph technique, which keeps the THC-A intact, and requires a conversion calculation of that THC-A to calculate total potential THC in a given sample. See the definition for decarboxylation.

*Produce.* To grow hemp plants for market, or for cultivation for market, in the United States.

*Producer.* Producer means a producer as defined in 7 CFR 718.2 that is licensed or authorized to produce hemp under this part.
