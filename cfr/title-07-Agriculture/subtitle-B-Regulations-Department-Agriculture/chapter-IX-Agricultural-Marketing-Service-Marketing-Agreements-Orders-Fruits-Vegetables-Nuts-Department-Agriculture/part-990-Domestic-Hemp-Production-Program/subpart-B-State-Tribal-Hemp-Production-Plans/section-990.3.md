##### § 990.3 State and Tribal plans; Plan requirements. #####

(a) *General requirements.* A State or Tribal plan submitted to the Secretary for approval must include the practice and procedures described in this paragraph (a).

(1) A State or Tribal plan must include a practice to collect, maintain, and report to the Secretary relevant, real-time information for each producer licensed or authorized to produce hemp under the State or Tribal plan regarding:

(i) Contact information as described in § 990.70(a)(1);

(ii) A legal description of the land on which the producer will produce hemp in the State or territory of the Indian Tribe including, to the extent practicable, its geospatial location; and

(iii) The status and number of the producer's license or authorization.

(2) A State or Tribal plan must include a procedure for accurate and effective sampling of all hemp produced, to include the requirements in this paragraph (a)(2).

(i) Within 15 days prior to the anticipated harvest of cannabis plants, a Federal, State, local, or Tribal law enforcement agency or other Federal, State, or Tribal designated person shall collect samples from the flower material from such cannabis plants for delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration level testing as described in §§ 990.24 and 990.25.

(ii) The method used for sampling from the flower material of the cannabis plant must be sufficient at a confidence level of 95 percent that no more than one percent (1%) of the plants in the lot would exceed the acceptable hemp THC level. The method used for sampling must ensure that a representative sample is collected that represents a homogeneous composition of the lot.

(iii) During a scheduled sample collection, the producer or an authorized representative of the producer shall be present at the growing site.

(iv) Representatives of the sampling agency shall be provided with complete and unrestricted access during business hours to all hemp and other cannabis plants, whether growing or harvested, and all land, buildings, and other structures used for the cultivation, handling, and storage of all hemp and other cannabis plants, and all locations listed in the producer license.

(v) A producer shall not harvest the cannabis crop prior to samples being taken.

(3) A State or Tribal plan must include a procedure for testing that is able to accurately identify whether the sample contains a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol content concentration level that exceeds the acceptable hemp THC level. The procedure must include a validated testing methodology that uses postdecarboxylation or other similarly reliable methods. The testing methodology must consider the potential conversion of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinolic *acid* (THC-A) in hemp into THC and the test result measures total available THC derived from the sum of the THC and THC-A content. Testing methodologies meeting the requirements of this paragraph (a)(3) include, but are not limited to, gas or liquid chromatography with detection. The total THC concentration level shall be determined and reported on a dry weight basis.

(i) Any test of a representative sample resulting in higher than the acceptable hemp THC level shall be conclusive evidence that the lot represented by the sample is not in compliance with this part. Lots tested and not certified by the DEA-registered laboratory at or below the acceptable hemp THC level may *not* be further handled, processed or enter the stream of commerce and the producer shall ensure the lot is disposed of in accordance with § 990.27.

(ii) Samples of hemp plant material from one lot shall not be commingled with hemp plant material from other lots.

(iii) Analytical testing for purposes of detecting the concentration levels of THC shall meet the following standards:

(A) Laboratory quality assurance must ensure the validity and reliability of test results;

(B) Analytical method selection, validation, and verification must ensure that the testing method used is appropriate (fit for purpose), and that the laboratory can successfully perform the testing;

(C) The demonstration of testing validity must ensure consistent, accurate analytical performance;

(D) Method performance specifications must ensure analytical tests are sufficiently sensitive for the purposes of the detectability requirements of this part; and

(E) An effective disposal procedure for hemp plants that are produced that do not meet the requirements of this part. The procedure must be in accordance with DEA reverse distributor regulations found at 21 CFR 1317.15.

(F) Measurement of uncertainty (MU) must be estimated and reported with test results. Laboratories shall use appropriate, validated methods and procedures for all testing activities and evaluate measurement of uncertainty.

(4) A State or Indian Tribe shall promptly notify the Administrator by certified mail or electronically of any occurrence of cannabis plants or plant material that do not meet the definition of hemp in this part and attach the records demonstrating the appropriate disposal of all of those plants and materials in the lot from which the representative samples were taken.

(5) A State or Tribal plan must include a procedure to comply with the enforcement procedures in § 990.6.

(6) A State or Tribal plan must include a procedure for conducting annual inspections of, at a minimum, a random sample of producers to verify that hemp is not produced in violation of this part. These procedures must enforce the terms of violations as stated in the Act and defined under § 990.6.

(7) A State or Tribal plan must include a procedure for submitting the information described in § 990.70 to the Secretary not more than 30 days after the date on which the information is received. All such information must be submitted to the USDA in a format that is compatible with USDA's information sharing system.

(8) The State or Tribal government must certify that the State or Indian Tribe has the resources and personnel to carry out the practices and procedures described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (7) of this section.

(9) The State or Tribal plan must include a procedure to share information with USDA to support the information sharing requirements in 7 U.S.C. 1639q(d). The procedure must include the requirements described in this paragraph (a)(9).

(i) The State or Tribal plan shall require producers to report their hemp crop acreage to the FSA, consistent with the requirement in § 990.7.

(ii) The State or Tribal government shall assign each producer with a license or authorization identifier in a format prescribed by USDA.

(iii) The State or Tribal government shall require producers to report the total acreage of hemp planted, harvested, and, if applicable, disposed. The State or Tribal government shall collect this information and report it to AMS.

(b) *Relation to State and Tribal law.* A State or Tribal plan may include any other practice or procedure established by a State or Indian Tribe, as applicable; *Provided,* That the practice or procedure is consistent with this part and Subtitle G of the Act.

(1) *No preemption.* Nothing in this part preempts or limits any law of a State or Indian Tribe that:

(i) Regulates the production of hemp; and

(ii) Is more stringent than this part or Subtitle G of the Act.

(2) *References in plans.* A State or Tribal plan may include a reference to a law of the State or Indian Tribe regulating the production of hemp, to the extent that the law is consistent with this part.
