##### ยง 990.4 USDA approval of State and Tribal plans. #####

(a) *General authority.* No plans will be accepted by USDA prior to October 31, 2019. No later than 60 calendar days after the receipt of a State or Tribal plan for a State or Tribal Nation in which production of hemp is legal, the Secretary shall:

(1) Approve the State or Tribal plan only if the State or Tribal plan complies with this part; or

(2) Disapprove the State or Tribal plan if the State or Tribal plan does not comply with this part. USDA shall provide written notification to the State or Tribe of the disapproval and the cause for the disapproval.

(b) *Amended plans.* A State or Tribal government, as applicable, must submit to the Secretary an amended plan if:

(1) The Secretary disapproves a State or Tribal plan if the State or Tribe wishes to have primary jurisdiction over hemp production within its State or territory of the Indian Tribe; or

(2) The State or Tribe makes substantive revisions to its plan or its laws which alter the way the plan meets the requirements of this part. If this occurs, the State or Tribal government must re-submit the plan with any modifications based on laws and regulation changes for USDA approval. Such re-submissions should be provided to USDA within 365 days from the date that the State or Tribal laws and regulations are effective. Producers shall continue to comply with the requirements of the existing plan while such modifications are under consideration by USDA. If State or Tribal government laws or regulations in effect under the USDA-approved plan change but the State or Tribal government does not re-submit a modified plan within one year from the effective date of the new law or regulation, the existing plan is revoked.

(3) USDA approval of State or Tribal government plans shall remain in effect unless an amended plan must be submitted to USDA because of a substantive revision to a State's or Tribe's plan, a relevant change in State or Tribal laws or regulations, or approval of the plan is revoked by USDA.

(c) *Technical assistance.* The Secretary may provide technical assistance to help a State or Indian Tribe develop or amend a plan. This may include the review of draft plans or other informal consultation as necessary.

(d) *Approved State or Tribal plans.* If the Secretary approves a State or Tribal plan, the Secretary shall notify the State or Tribe by letter or email.

(1) In addition to the approval letter, the State or Tribe shall receive their plan approval certificate either as an attachment or assessable via website link.

(2) The USDA shall post information regarding approved plans on its website.

(3) USDA approval of State or Tribal government plans shall remain in effect unless:

(i) The State or Tribal government laws and regulations in effect under the USDA-approved plan change, thus requiring such plan to be re-submitted for USDA approval.

(ii) A State or Tribal plan must be amended in order to comply with amendments to Subtitle G the Act and this part.

(e) *Producer rights upon revocation of State or Tribal plan.* If USDA revokes approval of the State or Tribal plan due to noncompliance as defined in ยง 990.5, producers licensed or authorized to produce hemp under the revoked State or Tribal plan may continue to produce for the remainder of the calendar year in which the revocation became effective. Producers may then apply to be licensed under the USDA plan for 90 days after the notification even if the time period does note coincide with the annual application window.
