*Provided,* That for whole and whole pitted styles of olives an additional size grading is required after processing, prior to canning, and those olives that fail to meet the requirements in § 932.52 may be used in limited use styles. *Provided further,* That the varietal groupings, average count ranges, and/or other size requirements may be changed or modified as recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary;

(iii) The committee may recommend, subject to approval by the Secretary, size certification procedures for olives used in the production of canned whole or pitted styles of olives: *Provided,* That if size certification for canned whole or pitted styles is implemented, marketing order sizes shall be adopted and size requirements in the U.S. Grade Standards shall not apply. Size certification of such styles shall be applicable to any or all sizes of olives recommended by the committee and approved by the Secretary pursuant to § 932.52(a)(2). Size certification procedures recommended to the Secretary may include but are not limited to the establishment of average count ranges, acceptable count ranges, and approximate counts (midpoints) for each variety or variety group.

(3) Each handler shall, under the supervision of any such inspection service, dispose of into noncanning use an aggregate quantity of olives, comparable in size and characteristics and equal to the quantities shown on the certification for each lot to be:

(i) Variety Group 1 olives, except the Ascolano, Barouni, and St. Agostino varieties, of a size which individually weigh less than1/90 pound;

(ii) Variety Group 1 olives of the Ascolano, Barouni, and St. Agostino varieties of a size which individually weigh less than1/140 pound;

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, a handler may (i) meet any deficit in such handler's undersize obligation in one variety by disposing of, under supervision of the inspection service, as other than canned ripe olives, an equal quantity of undersize olives, of any other variety, or by so disposing of an equal quantity of olives of that or any other variety of sizes larger than undersize of a quality better than culls, and (ii) meet any deficit in such handler's cull obligation in one variety by so disposing of an equal quantity of cull olives of any other variety, or by so disposing of an equal quantity of olives of any variety of sizes larger than undersize of a quality better than culls.

(5) Each handler shall hold at all times a quantity of olives equal to the quantities required in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, less any quantity previously disposed of as specified in such subparagraph.

(b) Whenever a handler receives a lot of natural condition olives, or makes a separation resulting in a sublot, solely for use in the production of green olives or canned ripe olives of the “tree-ripened” type, he may handle such lot or sublot without regard to the provisions of this section and § 932.52 only if (1) he notifies the committee upon receiving such a lot or making such a separation; (2) the identity of all such lots and sublots of olives is maintained by keeping them separate and apart from other olives he receives; (3) the packaged olives produced from such lots and sublots after processing are canned ripe olives of the “tree-ripened” type or green olives; and (4) there are no outgoing regulations pursuant to § 932.52 then applicable to packaged olives that are canned ripe olives of the “tree-ripened” type or green olives.
