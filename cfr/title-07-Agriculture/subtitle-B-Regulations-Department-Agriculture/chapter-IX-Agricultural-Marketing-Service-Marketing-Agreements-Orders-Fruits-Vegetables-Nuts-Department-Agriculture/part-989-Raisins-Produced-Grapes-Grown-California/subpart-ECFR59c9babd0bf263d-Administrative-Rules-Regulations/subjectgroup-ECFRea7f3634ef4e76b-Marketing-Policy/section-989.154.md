(a) *Desirable carryout levels.* The desirable carryout level to be used in computing and announcing a crop year's marketing policy for Natural (sun-dried) Seedless raisins shall be 85,000 natural condition tons. The desirable carryout level to be used in computing and announcing a crop year's marketing policy for all other varietal types of raisins specified in § 989.110 shall be equal to the total shipments of free tonnage during August, September, and one-half of October for each of the past 5 crop years, for each such varietal type, converted to a natural condition basis, dropping the high and low figures, and dividing the remaining sum by three.

(b) *Estimated trade demand.* Pursuant to § 989.54 (e)(4), estimated trade demand is a figure different than the trade demand computed according to the formula in § 989.54(a). The Committee shall use an estimated trade demand to compute preliminary and interim free and reserve percentages, or determine such final percentages for recommendation to the Secretary for 2007-08 crop Natural (sun-dried) Seedless (NS) raisins if the crop estimate is equal to, less than, or no more than 10 percent greater than the computed trade demand: *Provided,* That the final reserve percentage computed using such estimated trade demand shall be no more than 10 percent, and no reserve shall be established if the final 2007-08 NS raisin crop estimate is less than 215,000 natural condition tons.
