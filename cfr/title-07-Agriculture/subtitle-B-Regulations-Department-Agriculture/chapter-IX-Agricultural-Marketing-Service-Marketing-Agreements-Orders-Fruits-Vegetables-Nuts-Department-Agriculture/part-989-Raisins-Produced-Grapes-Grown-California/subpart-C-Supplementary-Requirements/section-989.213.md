Provided, That, for the 2023-2024 crop year, such raisins containing from 30.0 through 49.9 percent, by weight, of well-matured or reasonably well-matured raisins may be acquired by a handler under a weight dockage system. The creditable weight of each lot of raisins acquired under the maturity dockage system shall be obtained by multiplying the net weight of the lot of raisins by the applicable dockage factor from the dockage table prescribed in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section.
