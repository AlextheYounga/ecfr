B. *Explanation of terms.* (1) *Off-color* means a dull color or skin differing noticeably in appearance from that which is characteristic of mature, properly handled fruit of a given variety or type.

(2) *Inferior meat condition* means flesh which is fibrous, woody or otherwise inferior due to immaturity to the extent that the characteristic texture of the meat is substantially affected.

(3) *End cracks* means callous growth cracks, at the blossom end of prunes, aggregating more than three-eighths of one inch (3/8″) but not more than one-half of one inch (1/2″) in length.

(4) *Fermentation* means damage to the flesh by fermentation to the extent that the characteristic appearance or flavor is substantially affected.

(5) *Skin or flesh damage* means growth cracks, splits, breaks in skin or flesh of the following descriptions:

(a) Callous growth cracks, except end cracks as defined in this section, aggregating more than three-eighths of one inch (3/8″) in length;

(b) Splits or skin breaks exposing flesh and affecting materially the normal appearance of the prunes;

(c) Any cracks, splits or breaks open to the pit;

(d) Healed or unhealed surface or flesh blemishes caused by insect injury and which materially affect appearance, edibility or keeping quality;

(e) Skin damage caused by rain or overdipping to the extent that the prunes cannot be processed normally without material sloughing of the skin.

(6) *Scab* means tough or thick scab exceeding in the aggregate the area of a circle three-eighths of one inch (3/8″) in diameter or by unsightly scab of another character exceeding in the aggregate the area of a circle three-fourths of one inch (3/4″) in diameter.

(7) *Burned* means injury by sunburn or excessive heat in dehydration to the extent that the characteristic appearance, flavor or edibility of the fruit is noticeably affected.

(8) *Mold* means a characteristic fungus growth and is self-explanatory.

(9) *Imbedded dirt* means the presence of dirt or other extraneous material so imbedded in, or adhering to, the prune that it cannot be removed in normal processing.

(10) *Insect infestation* means the presence of insects, insect fragments or insect remains.

C. *Maximum tolerances.* Tolerance allowances shall be on a weight basis and shall not exceed the following:

(1) The tolerance allowance for decay shall not exceed one percent (1%).

(2) The combined tolerance allowance for mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation, and decay shall not exceed five percent (5%).

(3) The combined tolerance allowance for fermentation, skin or flesh damage, scab-burned, mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation, and decay shall not exceed eight percent (8%).

(4) The combined tolerance allowance for end cracks, fermentation, skin or flesh damage, scab, burned, mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation, and decay shall not exceed ten percent (10%), except that the first eight percent (8%) of end cracks shall be given one-half value and any additional percentage of end cracks shall be given full value.

(5) The combined tolerance allowance for off-color, inferior meat condition, end cracks, fermentation, skin or flesh damage, scab-burned, mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation, and decay shall not exceed twenty percent (20%), except that the first eight percent (8%) of end cracks shall be given one-half value and any additional percentage of end cracks shall be given full value.

(6) Prunes showing obvious live insect infestation shall be fumigated prior to acceptance.

D. Natural condition prunes must be properly dried and cured in original natural condition, without the addition of water, and free from active infestation, so that they are capable of being received, stored and packed without deterioration or spoilage.

II. Minimum standards for processed prunes:

B. *Explanation of terms.* (1) *Off-color* means a dull color or skin differing noticeably in appearance from that which is characteristic of mature, properly handled fruit of a given variety or type.

(2) *Inferior meat condition* means flesh which is fibrous, woody or otherwise inferior due to immaturity to the extent that the characteristic texture of the meat is substantially affected.

(4) *Fermentation* means damage to the flesh by fermentation to the extent that the characteristic appearance or flavor is substantially affected.

(5) *Skin or flesh damage* means growth cracks, splits, breaks in skin or flesh of the following descriptions:

(a) Callous growth cracks, except end cracks as defined in this section, aggregating more than three-eighths of one inch (3/8″) in length;

(b) Splits or skin breaks exposing flesh and materially affecting the normal appearance of French prunes; or markedly affecting the normal appearance of varieties other than the French variety;

(c) Any cracks, splits or breaks open to the pit;

(d) Healed or unhealed surface or flesh blemishes caused by insect injury and which materially affect appearance, edibility or keeping quality.

(6) *Scab* means tough or thick scab exceeding in the aggregate the area of a circle three-eighths of one inch (3/8″) in diameter or by unsightly scab of another character exceeding in the aggregate the area of a circle three-fourths of one inch (3/4″) in diameter.

(7) *Burned* means injury by sunburn or excessive heat in dehydration to the extent that the characteristic appearance, flavor or edibility of the fruit is noticeably affected.

(8) *Mold* means a characteristic fungus growth and is self-explanatory.

(9) *Imbedded dirt* means the presence of dirt or other extraneous material so imbedded in, or adhering to, the prune that it cannot be readily removed in washing the fruit.

(10) *Insect infestation* means the presence of insects, insect fragments or insect remains.

C. *Maximum tolerances.* Tolerance allowances shall be on a weight basis and shall not exceed the following:

(1) There shall be no tolerance allowance for live insect infestation.

(2) The tolerance allowance for decay shall not exceed one percent (1%).

(3) The combined tolerance allowance for mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation, and decay shall not exceed five percent (5%).

(4) The combined tolerance allowance for fermentation, skin or flesh damage, scab, burned, mold, imbedded dirt, insect infestation, and decay shall not exceed eight percent (8)%.
