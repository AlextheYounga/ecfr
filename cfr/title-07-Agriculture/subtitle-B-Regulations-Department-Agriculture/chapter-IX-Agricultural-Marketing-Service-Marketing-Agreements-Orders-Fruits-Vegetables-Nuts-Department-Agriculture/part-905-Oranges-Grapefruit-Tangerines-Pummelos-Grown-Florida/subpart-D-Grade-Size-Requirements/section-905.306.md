<sup>1</sup> Florida No. 1 Golden grade for Honey tangerines means the same as provided in Rule No. 20-35.03 of the Regulation of the Florida Department of Citrus.

(c) *Size tolerances.* To allow for variations incident to proper sizing in the determination of minimum diameters as prescribed in Tables I and II, not more than 10 percent, by count, of the fruit in any lot of containers may fail to meet the minimum diameter size requirements, and not more than 15 percent, by count, in any individual sample may fail to meet the minimum diameter size requirements specified: *Provided,* That such tolerances for other than Navel and Temple oranges shall be based only on the oranges in the lot measuring 214/16 inches or smaller in diameter.

(d) Terms used in the marketing order including Improved No. 2 grade for grapefruit, when used herein, mean the same as is given to the terms in the order; Florida No. 1 grade for Honey tangerines means the same as provided in Rule No. 20-35.03 of the Regulations of the Florida Department of Citrus, and terms relating to grade, except Improved No. 2 grade for grapefruit and diameter, shall mean the same as is given to the terms in the revised U. S. Standards for Grades of Florida Oranges and Tangelos (7 CFR 51.1140 through 51.1179), the revised U. S. Standards for Florida Tangerines (7 CFR 51.1810 through 51.1837), or the revised U. S. Standards for Grades of Florida Grapefruit (7 CFR 51.750 through 51.784).

(e)(1) All grapefruit shipped under the order shall meet minimum maturity requirements of 8.0 percent soluble solids (sugars) and 7.5 to 1 solids to acid ratio or shall comply with one of the alternate equivalent soluble solids and solids to acid ratio combinations set forth in Table III: *Provided,* That the minimum ratio shall not drop below 7.2 even if the soluble solids (sugars) reaches a level higher than 9.6.

(2) Notwithstanding the provision of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for the period December 23, 2004 to July 31, 2005, all grapefruit shipped under the order shall meet minimum maturity requirements of 7.5 percent soluble solids (sugars) and 7.5 to 1 solids to acid ratio or shall comply with one of the alternate equivalent soluble solids and solids to acid ratio combinations set forth in Table III: Provided, That the minimum ratio shall not drop below 7.2 even if the soluble solids (sugars) reaches a level higher than 9.6.
