##### ยง 984.64 Disposition of substandard walnuts. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 27109, May 7, 2020.

Substandard walnuts may be disposed of only for manufacture into oil, livestock feed, or such other uses as the Board determines to be noncompetitive with existing domestic and export markets for merchantable walnuts and with proper safeguards to prevent such walnuts from thereafter entering channels of trade in such markets. Wherever free and reserve percentages are in effect, the kernelweight of any walnuts meeting the minimum kernel content requirements effective pursuant to ยง 984.50(e), may be pooled and the disposition credited to the handler's reserve obligation pursuant to ยง 984.56. Each handler shall submit, in such form and at such intervals as the Board may determine, reports of (a) his production and holdings of substandard walnuts and (b) the disposition of all substandard walnuts to any other person, showing the quantity, lot, date, name and address of the person to whom delivered, the approved use and such other information pertaining thereto as the Board may specify.
