(a) *Reserve obligation.* Whenever free and reserve percentages are in effect for a marketing year, each handler shall withhold a kernelweight of certified merchantable walnuts equal to a quantity derived by the application of the reserve percentage to the kernelweight of merchantable walnuts certified.

(b) *Holding requirements.* Each handler shall at all times hold in his possession or under his control in proper storage the kernelweight of certified merchantable walnuts necessary to meet his reserve obligation less:

(1) Any quantity which was disposed of by him pursuant to § 984.56; and

(2) Any quantity for which he is otherwise relieved by the Board of responsibility to so hold walnuts.
