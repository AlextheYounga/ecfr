##### ยง 4280.320 Grant administration. #####

(a) *Oversight.* Any MDO receiving a grant under this program is subject to Agency oversight, with site visits and inspection of records occurring at the discretion of the Agency. In addition, MDOs receiving a grant under this subpart must submit reports, as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section.

(1) On a quarterly basis, within 30 days after the end of each Federal fiscal quarter, the microlender will provide to the Agency an Agency-approved quarterly report containing such information as the Agency may require to ensure that funds provided are being used for the purposes for which the grant was made, including:

(i) A program performance report required by 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA in 2 CFR part 400. This report will include information on the microlender's technical assistance, training, and/or enhancement activity, and grant expenses, milestones met, or unmet, explanation of difficulties, observations and other such information; and

(ii) As appropriate, SF-270.

(2) If a microlender has more than one grant from the Agency, a separate report must be made for each.

(3) Other reports may be required by the Agency from time to time in the event of poor performance or other such occurrences that require more than the usual set of reporting information.

(b) *Payments.* The Agency will make grant payments not more often than on a quarterly basis. The first payment may be made in advance and will equal no more than one fourth of the grant award. Payment requests must be submitted on Standard Form 270 and will only be paid if reports are up to date and approved.
