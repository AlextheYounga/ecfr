##### ยง 4280.301 Purpose and scope. #####

(a) This subpart contains the provisions and procedures by which the Agency will administer the Rural Microenterprise Assistance Program (RMAP). The purpose of the program is to support the development and ongoing success of rural microentrepreneurs and microenterprises. To accomplish this purpose, the program will make direct loans, and provide grants to selected Microenterprise Development Organizations (MDOs). Selected MDOs will use the funds to:

(1) Provide microloans to rural microentrepreneurs and microenterprises;

(2) Provide business based training and technical assistance to rural microborrowers and potential microborrowers; and

(3) Perform other such activities as deemed appropriate by the Secretary to ensure the development and ongoing success of rural microenterprises.

(b) The Agency will make direct loans to microlenders, as defined in ยง 4280.302, for the purpose of providing fixed interest rate microloans to rural microentrepreneurs for startup and growing microenterprises. Eligible microlenders will also be automatically eligible to receive microlender technical assistance grants to provide technical assistance and training to microentrepreneurs that have received or are seeking a microloan under this program.

(c) To allow for extended opportunities for technical assistance and training, the Agency will make technical assistance-only grants to MDOs that have sources of funding other than program funds for making or facilitating microloans.
