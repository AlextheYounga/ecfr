The Agency must concur with any changes proposed to the Letter of Conditions by the Applicant before the application will be further processed.

(b) *Insurance requirements.* Agency approved insurance coverage must be maintained for 3 years after the Agency has approved the final performance report unless this requirement is waived or modified by the Agency in writing. Insurance coverage shall include, but is not limited to:

The grantee must abide by all requirements contained in the Financial Assistance Agreement, this subpart, and any other applicable Federal statutes or regulations. Failure to follow these requirements might result in termination of the grant and adoption of other available remedies.

(g) *Grant approval.* The grantee will be sent a copy of the executed Form RD 1940-1, the approved scope of work, and the Financial Assistance Agreement.

(h) *Power Purchase Agreement.* Where applicable, the grantee shall provide to the Agency a copy of the executed Power Purchase Agreement within 12 months from the date that the Financial Assistance Agreement is executed, unless otherwise approved by the Agency.
