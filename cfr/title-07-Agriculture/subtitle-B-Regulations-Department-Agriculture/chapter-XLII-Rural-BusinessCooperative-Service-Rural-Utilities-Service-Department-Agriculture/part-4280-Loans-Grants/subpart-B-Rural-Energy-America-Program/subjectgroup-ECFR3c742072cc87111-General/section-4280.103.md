(ii) Dollar Value of Energy reduced or replaced incorporates the following:

(A) Energy reduced or replaced will be calculated on the quantity of energy saved or replaced as determined by subtracting the result obtained under paragraph (2)(ii)(A)(*2*) from the result obtained under paragraph (2)(ii)(A)(*1*) of this definition, and converting to a monetary value using a constant value or price of energy (as determined under paragraph (2)(ii)(A)(*3*) of this definition).

(*1*) Actual energy used in the original building and/or equipment, as applicable, prior to the RES or EEI project, must be based on the actual average annual total energy used in British thermal units (BTU) over the most recent 12, 24, 36, 48, or 60 consecutive months of operation.

(*2*) Projected energy use if the proposed RES or EEI project had been in place for the original building and/or equipment, as applicable, for the same time period used to determine that actual energy use under paragraph (2)(ii)(A)(*1*) of this definition.

(*3*) Value or price of energy must be the actual average price paid over the same time period used to calculate the actual energy used under paragraph (2)(ii)(A)(*1*) of this definition. RES projects that will replace 100 percent of an Applicant's energy use will be required to use the actual average price paid for the energy replaced and the projected revenue received from energy sold in a typical year.

(B) Does not allow Energy Efficiency Improvements to monetize benefits other than the dollar amount of the energy savings the Agricultural Producer or Rural Small Business realizes as a result of the improvement.

(C) Does not include any tax credits, carbon credits, renewable energy credits, and construction and investment-related benefits.
