##### ยง 4280.105 Review or appeal rights. #####

An Applicant, lender, holder, borrower, or grantee may seek a review of an Agency decision or appeal to the National Appeals Division in accordance with 7 CFR part 11.

(a) *Guaranteed Loan.* In cases where the Agency has denied or reduced the amount of final loss payment to the lender, the adverse decision may be appealed by the lender only. An adverse decision that only impacts the holder may be appealed by the holder only. A decision by a lender adverse to the interest of the borrower is not a decision by the Agency, whether or not concurred in by the Agency.

(b) *Combined guaranteed loan and grant.* For an adverse decision involving a combination guaranteed loan and grant funding request, only the party that is adversely affected may request the review or appeal.
