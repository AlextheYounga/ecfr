##### ยง 4280.131 Credit quality. #####

The lender is primarily responsible for determining credit quality and must address all of the elements of credit quality in a written credit analysis including adequacy of equity, cash flow, collateral, history, management, and the current status of the industry for which credit is to be extended.

(a) *Cash flow.* All efforts will be made to structure or restructure debt so that the business has adequate debt coverage and the ability to accommodate expansion.

(b) *Collateral.* (1) Collateral must have documented value sufficient to protect the interest of the lender and the Agency and, except as set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the discounted collateral value will be at least equal to the loan amount. Lenders will discount collateral consistent with sound loan-to-value policy.

(2) Some businesses are predominantly cash-flow oriented, and where cash flow and profitability are strong, loan-to-value coverage may be discounted accordingly. A loan primarily based on cash flow must be supported by a successful and documented financial history.

(c) *Industry.* Current status of the industry will be considered and businesses in areas of decline will be required to provide strong business plans which outline how they differ from the current trends. The regulatory environment surrounding the particular business or industry will be considered.

(d) *Equity.* Borrowers must demonstrate evidence of a financial contribution in the project of not less than 25 percent of total Eligible Project Costs. Federal grant funds may be used as the financial contribution.

(e) *Lien priorities.* The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and unguaranteed portions of the loan. The unguaranteed portion of the loan will neither be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion. A parity or junior position may be considered provided that discounted collateral values are adequate to secure the loan in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section after considering prior liens.

(f) *Management.* A thorough review of key management personnel will be completed to ensure that the business has adequately trained and experienced managers.
