##### § 4280.135 Scoring RES and EEI guaranteed loan-only applications. #####

(a) *Evaluation criteria.* The Agency will score each guaranteed loan-only application received using the evaluation criteria specified in § 4280.120, except that, in § 4280.120(b)(1), the calculation will be made on the loan amount requested and not on the grant amount requested.

(b) *Minimum score.* The Agency will establish a minimum score that guaranteed loan-only applications must meet in order to be considered for funding in periodic competitions, as specified in § 4280.139(a). The minimum score is 50 points, and may be adjusted through the publishing of a Notice in the Federal Register. Any application that does not meet the applicable minimum score is only eligible to compete in a National competition as specified in § 4280.139(c)(2).

(c) *Notification.* The Agency will notify in writing each lender and borrower whose application does not meet the applicable minimum score.
