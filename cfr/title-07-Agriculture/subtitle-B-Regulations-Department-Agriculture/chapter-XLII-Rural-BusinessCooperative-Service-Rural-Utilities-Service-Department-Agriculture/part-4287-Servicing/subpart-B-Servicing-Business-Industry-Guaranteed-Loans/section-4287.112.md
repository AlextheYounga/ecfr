##### § 4287.112 Interest rate changes. #####

(a) The borrower, lender, and holder (if any) may collectively initiate a permanent or temporary reduction in the interest rate of the guaranteed loan at any time during the life of the loan upon written agreement among these parties. The lender must obtain prior Agency concurrence and provide a copy of the modification agreement to the Agency. If any of the guaranteed portion has been purchased by the Agency, the Agency (as a holder) will affirm or reject interest rate change proposals in writing.

(b) No increases in interest rates will be permitted, except the normal fluctuations in approved variable interest rates, unless a temporary interest rate reduction occurred.

(c) The interest rate, after adjustments, must comply with the interest rate requirements set forth in § 4279.125 of this chapter.

(d) The lender is responsible for the legal documentation of interest-rate changes by an endorsement or any other legally effective amendment to the promissory note; however, no new notes shall be issued. The lender must provide copies of all legal documents to the Agency.
