##### § 4288.102 Definitions. #####

The definitions set forth in this section are applicable for all purposes of program administration under this subpart.

*Advanced biofuel.* A fuel that is derived from renewable biomass, other than corn kernel starch, to include:

(1) Biofuel derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin;

(2) Biofuel derived from sugar and starch (other than ethanol derived from corn kernel starch);

(3) Biofuel derived from waste material, including crop residue, other vegetative waste material, animal waste, food waste, and yard waste;

(4) Diesel-equivalent fuel derived from renewable biomass, including vegetable oil and animal fat;

(5) Biogas (including landfill gas and sewage waste treatment gas) produced through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass;

(6) Butanol or other alcohols produced through the conversion of organic matter from renewable biomass; or

(7) Other fuel derived from cellulosic biomass.

*Advanced biofuel producer.* An individual, corporation, company, foundation, association, labor organization, firm, partnership, society, joint stock company, group of organizations, or non-profit entity that produces and sells an advanced biofuel. An entity that blends or otherwise combines advanced biofuels into a blended biofuel is not considered an advanced biofuel producer under this Program.

*Agency.* The USDA Rural Development, Rural Business-Cooperative Service or its successor organization.

*Alcohol.* Anhydrous ethyl alcohol manufactured in the United States and its territories and sold either:

(1) For fuel use, rendered unfit for beverage use, produced at a biofuel facility and in a manner approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives for the production of alcohol for fuel; or

(2) As denatured alcohol used by blenders and refiners and rendered unfit for beverage use.

*Alcohol producer.* An advanced biofuel producer authorized by ATF to produce alcohol.

*ATF.* The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives of the United States Department of Justice.

*Biodiesel.* A mono alkyl ester, manufactured in the United States and its territories, that meets the requirements of the appropriate ASTM International standard.

*Biofuel.* Fuel derived from renewable biomass.

*Biofuel facility.* A facility (including equipment and processes) that converts renewable biomass into biofuels and biobased products and may produce electricity.

*Blender.* A blender is a processor of fuels who combines two or more fuels, one of which must be an advanced biofuel, for distribution and sale. Producers who blend one or more of their own fuels are not blenders under this definition.

*Certificate of analysis.* A document approved by the Agency that certifies the quality and purity of the advanced biofuel being produced. The document must be from a qualified, independent third party.

*Contract.* Form RD 4288-2, “Advanced Biofuel Payment Program Contract,” signed by the eligible advanced biofuel producer and the Agency, that defines the terms and conditions for participating in and receiving payment under this Program.

*Eligible advanced biofuel producer.* A producer of advanced biofuels that meets all requirements of § 4288.110 of this subpart.

*Eligible renewable biomass.* Renewable biomass, as defined in this section, excluding corn kernel starch.

*Eligible renewable energy content.* That portion of an advanced biofuel's energy content derived from eligible renewable biomass feedstock. The energy content from any portion of the biofuel, whether from, for example, blending with another fuel or a denaturant, that is derived from a non-eligible renewable biomass feedstock (e.g., corn kernel starch) is not eligible for payment under this Program.

*Enrollment application.* Form RD 4288-1, “Advanced Biofuel Payment Program Annual Application,” which is submitted by advanced biofuel producers for participation in this Program.

*Ethanol.* Anhydrous ethyl alcohol manufactured in the United States and its territories and sold either:

(1) For fuel use, and which has been rendered unfit for beverage use and produced at an advanced biofuel facility approved by the ATF for the production of ethanol for fuel, or

(2) As denatured ethanol used by blenders and energy refiners, which has been rendered unfit for beverage use.

*Ethanol producer.* An advanced biofuel producer authorized by ATF to produce ethanol.

*Fiscal Year.* A 12-month period beginning each October 1 and ending September 30 of the following calendar year.

*Flared gas.* The burning of unwanted gas through a pipe (also called a flare). Flaring is a means of disposal used when the operator cannot transport the gas to market or convert to electricity and cannot use the gas for any other purpose.

*Forest biomass.* Any plant or tree material produced by forest growth, such as trees, wood, brush, thinning, chips, and slash.

*Incremental production.* The quantity of eligible advanced biofuel produced at an advanced biofuel biorefinery in the fiscal year for which payment is sought that exceeds the quantity of advanced biofuel produced at the biorefinery over the prior fiscal year.

*Larger producer.* An eligible advanced biofuel producer with a refining capacity as determined for the prior fiscal year, based on all of the advanced biofuel facilities in which the producer has 50 percent or more ownership, exceeding:

(1) 150,000,000 gallons of liquid advanced biofuel per year; or

(2) 15,900,000 MMBTU of biogas and solid advanced biofuel per year.

*Payment application.* Form RD 4288-3, “Advanced Biofuel Payment Program - Payment Request,” which is submitted by an eligible advance producer to the Agency in order to receive payment under this Program.

*Quarter.* The Federal fiscal time period for any fiscal year as follows:

(1) 1st Quarter: October 1 through December 31;

(2) 2nd Quarter: January 1 through March 31;

(3) 3rd Quarter: April 1 through June 30; and

(4) 4th Quarter: July 1 through September 30.

*Renewable biomass.*

(1) Materials, pre-commercial thinnings, or invasive species from National Forest System land and public lands (as defined in section 103 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702)) that:

(i) Are byproducts of preventive treatments that are removed to reduce hazardous fuels; to reduce or contain disease or insect infestation; or to restore ecosystem health;

(ii) Would not otherwise be used for higher-value products; and

(iii) Are harvested in accordance with applicable law and land management plans and the requirements for old-growth maintenance, restoration, and management direction of paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(4) and large-tree retention of paragraph (f) of section 102 of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6512); or

(2) Any organic matter that is available on a renewable or recurring basis from non-Federal land or land belonging to an Indian or Indian Tribe that is held in trust by the United States or subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States, including:

(i) Renewable plant material, including feed grains; other agricultural commodities; other plants and trees; and algae; and

(ii) Waste material, including crop residue; other vegetative waste material (including wood waste and wood residues); animal waste and byproducts (including fats, oils, greases, and manure); and food waste and yard waste.
