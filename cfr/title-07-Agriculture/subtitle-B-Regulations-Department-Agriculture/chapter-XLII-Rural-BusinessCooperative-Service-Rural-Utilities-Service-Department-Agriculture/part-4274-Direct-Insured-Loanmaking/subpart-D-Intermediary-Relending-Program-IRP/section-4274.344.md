(b) *Filing applications.* Intermediaries must file the complete application, in one package. Applications received by the Agency will be reviewed and ranked quarterly and funded in the order of priority ranking. The Agency will retain unsuccessful applications for consideration in subsequent reviews, through a total of four quarterly reviews.

(c) *Loan priorities.* A point system will be used to determine an eligible applicant's priority for available loan funds. Points will be allowed only for factors indicated by well documented, reasonable plans which, in the opinion of the Agency, provide assurance that the items have a high probability of being accomplished. The points awarded will be as specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(6) of this section. If an application does not fit one of the categories listed, it receives no points for that paragraph or subparagraph.

(1) *Other funds.* Points allowed under this paragraph are to be based on documented successful history or written evidence that the funds are available.

(i) The intermediary will obtain non-Federal loan or grant funds to pay part of the cost of the ultimate recipients' projects. The amount of funds from other sources will average:
