##### § 4274.314 Loan purposes. #####

(a) *Intermediaries.* Agency IRP loan funds must be placed in the intermediary's IRP revolving fund and used by the intermediary to provide direct loans to eligible ultimate recipients.

(b) *Ultimate recipients.* Loans from the intermediary to the ultimate recipient using the IRP revolving fund must be for community development projects, the establishment of new businesses, expansion of existing businesses, creation of employment opportunities, or saving existing jobs. Such loans may include, but are not limited to:

(1) Business and industrial acquisitions when the loan will keep the business from closing, prevent the loss of employment opportunities, or provide expanded job opportunities.

(2) Business construction, conversion, enlargement, repair, modernization, or development.

(3) Purchase and development of land, easements, rights-of-way, buildings, facilities, leases, or materials.

(4) Purchase of equipment, leasehold improvements, machinery, or supplies.

(5) Pollution control and abatement.

(6) Transportation services.

(7) Start-up operating costs and working capital.

(8) Interest (including interest on interim financing) during the period before the facility becomes income producing, but not to exceed 3 years.

(9) Feasibility studies.

(10) Debt refinancing.

(i) The intermediary is responsible for making prudent lending decisions based on sound underwriting principles when considering the restructuring of an ultimate recipient's debt; and

(ii) Refinancing debts may be allowed only when it is determined by the intermediary that the project is viable and refinancing is necessary to create new or save existing jobs or create or continue a needed service; and

(iii) On any request for refinancing of existing secured loans, the intermediary is required, at a minimum, to obtain the previously held collateral as security for the loans and must not pay off a creditor in excess of the value of the collateral. Additional collateral will be required when the refinancing of unsecured loans is unavoidable to accomplish the necessary strengthening of the ultimate recipient's position.

(11) Reasonable fees and charges only as specifically listed in this paragraph. Authorized fees include loan packaging fees, environmental data collection fees, management consultant fees, and other fees for services rendered by professionals. Professionals are generally persons licensed by States or accreditation associations, such as engineers, architects, lawyers, accountants, and appraisers. The maximum amount of fee will be what is reasonable and customary in the community or region where the project is located. Any such fees are to be fully documented and justified.

(12) Hotels, motels, tourist homes, bed and breakfast establishments, convention centers, and other tourist and recreational facilities except as prohibited by § 4274.319.

(13) Educational institutions.

(14) Revolving lines of credit: *Provided,*

(i) The portion of the intermediary's total IRP revolving fund that is committed to or in use for revolving lines of credit will not exceed 25 percent at any time;

(ii) All ultimate recipients receiving revolving lines of credit will be required to reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving line of credit to zero at least one time each year;

(iii) All revolving lines of credit will be approved by the intermediary for a specific maximum amount and for a specific maximum time period, not to exceed two years;

(iv) The intermediary will provide a detailed description, which will be incorporated into the intermediary's work plan and be subject to Agency approval, of how the revolving lines of credit will be operated and managed. The description will include evidence that the intermediary has an adequate system for:

(A) Interest calculations on varying balances, and

(B) Monitoring and control of the ultimate recipients' cash, inventory, and accounts receivable; and

(v) If, at any time, the Agency determines that an intermediary's operation of revolving lines of credit is causing excessive risk of loss for the intermediary or the Government, the Agency may terminate the intermediary's authority to use the IRP revolving fund for revolving lines of credit. Such termination will be by written notice and will prevent the intermediary from approving any new lines of credit or extending any existing revolving lines of credit beyond the effective date of termination contained in the notice.

(15) Aquaculture-based rural small businesses.
