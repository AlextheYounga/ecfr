##### ยง 4274.343 Application. #####

(a) The application will consist of:

(1) An application form provided by the Agency.

(2) A written work plan and other evidence the Agency requires to demonstrate the feasibility of the intermediary's program to meet the objectives of this program. The plan must, at a minimum:

(i) Document the intermediary's ability to administer IRP in accordance with the provisions of this subpart. In order to adequately demonstrate the ability to administer the program, the intermediary must provide a complete listing of all personnel responsible for administering this program along with a statement of their qualifications and experience. The personnel may be either members or employees of the intermediary's organization or contract personnel hired for this purpose. If the personnel are to be contracted for, the contract between the intermediary and the entity providing such service will be submitted for Agency review, and the terms of the contract and its duration must be sufficient to adequately service the Agency loan through to its ultimate conclusion. If the Agency determines the personnel lack the necessary expertise to administer the program, the loan request will not be approved;

(ii) Document the intermediary's ability to commit financial resources under the control of the intermediary to the establishment of IRP. This should include a statement of the sources of non-Agency funds for administration of the intermediary's operations and financial assistance for projects;

(iii) Demonstrate a need for loan funds. As a minimum, the intermediary should identify a sufficient number of proposed and known ultimate recipients it has on hand to justify Agency funding of its loan request, or include well developed targeting criteria for ultimate recipients consistent with the intermediary's mission and strategy for IRP, along with supporting statistical or narrative evidence that such prospective recipients exist in sufficient numbers to justify Agency funding of the loan request;

(iv) Include a list of proposed fees and other charges it will assess the ultimate recipients;

(v) Demonstrate to Agency satisfaction that the intermediary has secured commitments of significant financial support from public agencies and private organizations;

(vi) Provide evidence to Agency satisfaction that the intermediary has a proven record of obtaining private or philanthropic funds for the operation of similar programs to IRP;

(vii) Include the intermediary's plan (specific loan purposes) for relending the loan funds. The plan must be of sufficient detail to provide the Agency with a complete understanding of what the intermediary will accomplish by lending the funds to the ultimate recipient and the complete mechanics of how the funds will get from the intermediary to the ultimate recipient. The service area, eligibility criteria, loan purposes, fees, rates, terms, collateral requirements, limits, priorities, application process, method of disposition of the funds to the ultimate recipient, monitoring of the ultimate recipient's accomplishments, and reporting requirements by the ultimate recipient's management are some of the items that must be addressed by the intermediary's relending plan;

(viii) Provide a set of goals, strategies, and anticipated outcomes for the intermediary's program. Outcomes should be expressed in quantitative or observable terms such as jobs created for low income area residents or self empowerment opportunities funded, and should relate to the purpose of IRP (see ยง 4274.301(b)); and

(ix) Provide specific information as to whether and how the intermediary will ensure that technical assistance is made available to ultimate recipients and potential ultimate recipients. Describe the qualifications of the technical assistance providers, the nature of technical assistance that will be available, and expected and committed sources of funding for technical assistance. If other than the intermediary itself, describe the organizations providing such assistance and the arrangements between such organizations and the intermediary.

(3) Except for 7 CFR 1970.53 actions that are determined by the primary recipients to not have extraordinary circumstances, an agreement in writing to the environmental requirements in accordance with 7 CFR part 1970.

(4) Comments from the State Single Point of Contact, if the State has elected to review the program under Executive Order 12372;

(5) A *pro forma* balance sheet at start-up and projected balance sheets for at least 3 additional years; financial statements for the last 3 years, or from inception of the operations of the intermediary if less than 3 years; and projected cash flow and earnings statements for at least 3 years supported by a list of assumptions showing the basis for the projections. The projected earnings statement and balance sheet must include one set of projections that shows the IRP revolving fund only and a separate set of projections that shows the proposed intermediary organization's total operations. Also, if principal repayment on the IRP loan will not be scheduled during the first 3 years, the projections for the IRP revolving fund must extend to include a year with a full annual installment on the IRP loan;

(6) A written agreement of the intermediary to the Agency audit requirements;

(7) An agreement on a form provided by the Agency assuring compliance with

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964;

(8) Complete organizational documents, including evidence of authority to conduct the proposed activities;

(9) Evidence that the loan is not available at reasonable rates and terms from private sources or other Federal, State, or local programs;

(10) Latest audit report, if available;

(11) A form provided by the Agency in which the applicant certifies its understanding of the Federal collection policies for consumer or commercial debts;

(12) A Department of Agriculture form containing a certification regarding debarment, suspension, and other responsibility matters for primary covered transactions; and

(13) A statement on a form provided by the Agency (Appendix B to Part 418 - Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying) regarding lobbying, as required by 2 CFR part 418.

(b) Applications from intermediaries that already have an active IRP loan may be streamlined as follows:

(1) The requirements of paragraphs (a)(6), (a)(8), and (a)(10) of this section may be omitted;

(2) A statement that the new loan would be operated in accordance with the work plan on file for the previous loan may be submitted in lieu of a new work plan; and

(3) The financial information required by paragraph (a)(5) of this section may be limited to projections for the proposed new IRP revolving loan fund.
