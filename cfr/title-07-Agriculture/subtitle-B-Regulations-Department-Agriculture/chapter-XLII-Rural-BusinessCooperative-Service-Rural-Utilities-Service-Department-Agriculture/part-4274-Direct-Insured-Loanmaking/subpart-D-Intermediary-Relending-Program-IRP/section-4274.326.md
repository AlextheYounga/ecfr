##### § 4274.326 Security. #####

(a) *Intermediaries.* Security for all loans to intermediaries must be such that the repayment of the loan is reasonably assured, when considered along with the intermediary's financial condition, work plan, and management ability. It is the responsibility of the intermediary to make loans to ultimate recipients in such a manner that will fully protect the interests of the intermediary and the Government.

(1) Security for such loans may include, but is not limited to:

(i) Any realty, personalty, or intangible capable of being mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise encumbered by the intermediary in favor of the Agency; and

(ii) Any realty, personalty, or intangible capable of being mortgaged, pledged, or otherwise encumbered by an ultimate recipient in favor of the Agency.

(2) Initial security will consist of a pledge by the intermediary of all assets now in or hereafter placed in the IRP revolving fund, including cash and investments, notes receivable from ultimate recipients, and the intermediary's security interest in collateral pledged by ultimate recipients. Except for good cause shown, the Agency will not obtain assignments of specific assets at the time a loan is made to an intermediary or ultimate recipient. The intermediary will covenant that, in the event the intermediary's financial condition deteriorates or the intermediary takes action detrimental to prudent fund operation or fails to take action required of a prudent lender, the intermediary will provide additional security, execute any additional documents, and undertake any reasonable acts the Agency may request to protect the Agency's interest or to perfect a security interest in any asset, including physical delivery of assets and specific assignments to the Agency. All debt instruments and collateral documents used by an intermediary in connection with loans to ultimate recipients must be assignable.

(3) In addition to normal security documents, a first lien interest in the intermediary's revolving fund account will be accomplished by a control agreement satisfactory to RBS. The control agreement does not have to require RBS signature for withdrawals. The depository bank shall waive its offset and recoupment rights against the depository account to RBS and subordinate any liens it may have against the IRP depository bank account. The use of Form RD 402-1, “Deposit Agreement,” or similar form developed by the State Regional Office of the General Counsel is acceptable.

(b) *Ultimate recipients.* Security for a loan from an intermediary's IRP revolving fund to an ultimate recipient will be negotiated between the intermediary and ultimate recipient, within the general security policies established by the intermediary and approved by the Agency.
