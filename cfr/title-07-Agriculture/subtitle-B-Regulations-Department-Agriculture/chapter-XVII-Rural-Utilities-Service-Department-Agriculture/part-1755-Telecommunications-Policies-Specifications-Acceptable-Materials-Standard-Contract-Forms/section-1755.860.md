(b) *Test Sample Preparation.* Prepare the sample by removing the inner and outer jacket, shield, and core wrap, if present, for a sufficient distance to allow one end to be accessed for test connections. Cut out a series of 2.5 millimeter by 13 millimeter (0.1 inch by 0.5 inch) rectangular slots along the test sample, at 300 millimeter (1 foot) intervals progressing successively 90 degrees around the circumference of the wire. Assure that the wire core is exposed at each slot by slitting the inner jacket and core wrap if present. Place the prepared sample in a dry vessel which when filled will maintain a one meter (3 foot) head of water over 6 meters (20 feet) of uncoiled wire. Extend and fasten the ends of the wire so they will be above the water line and the pairs are rigidly held for the duration of the test.

Collect the water leakage from the end of the test sample during the test and weigh to the nearest 0.1 gram. Immediately after the one hour test, seal the ends of the wire with a thin layer of grease and remove all visible water from the closure, being careful not to remove water that penetrated into the core during the test. Reweigh the sample and determine the weight of water that penetrated into the core. The weight of water that penetrated into the core must not exceed 1 gram.

(b) *Sample Testing.* Center the mid 50 millimeters (2 inches) of the twisted pair between two smooth rigid parallel metal plates measuring 50 millimeters (2 inches) in length or diameter. Apply a 1.5 volt direct current potential between the conductors, using a light or buzzer to indicate electrical contact between the conductors. Apply a constant load of 67 newtons (15 pound-force) on the sample for one minute and monitor for evidence of contact between the conductors. Record results on suggested formats attached in (V) of this appendix or on other easily readable formats.

(5) *Jacket Slip Strength Test*—(a) *Sample Selection.* Test sample E from (III)(1)(a) of this appendix.

(b) *Sample Preparation.* Prepare test sample in accordance with the procedures specified in ASTM D 4565-90a.

(c) *Sample Conditioning and Testing.* Remove the sample from the tensile tester prior to testing and condition for one hour at 50 ±2 °C. Test immediately in accordance with the procedure specified in ASTM D 4565-90a. A minimum outer jacket slip strength of 67 newtons (15 pound-force) is required. Record the load attained.

(6) *Humidity Exposure.* (a) Repeat steps (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(iii) of this appendix for separate set of samples B, C, D and E which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.

(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, expose the test sample to 100 temperature cyclings. Relative humidity within the chamber must be maintained at 90 ±2 percent. One cycle consists of beginning at a stabilized chamber and test sample temperature of 52 ±1 °C, increasing the temperature to 57 ±1 °C, allowing the chamber and test samples to stabilize at this level, then dropping the temperature back to 52 ±1 °C.

(c) Repeat steps (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix.

(7) *Temperature Cycling.* (a) Repeat steps (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(iii) of this appendix for separate set of samples B, C, D and E which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.

(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, subject the test sample to 10 cycles of temperature between −40 °C and + 60 °C. The test sample must be held at each temperature extreme for a minimum of 11/2 hours during each cycle of temperature. The air within the temperature cycling chamber must be circulated throughout the duration of the cycling.

(c) Repeat steps (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix.

(IV) *Control Sample*—(1) *Test Samples.* A separate set of lengths for samples A, C, D, and E must have been maintained at 23 ±3 °C for at least 48 hours before the testing.

(2) Repeat steps (III)(2) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix except use length A instead of length B.

(3) *Surge Test.* (a) One length of sample F must be used to measure the breakdown between conductors while the other length of F must be used to measure core to shield breakdown.

(b) The samples must be capable of withstanding, without damage, a single surge voltage of 20 kilovolts peak between conductors, and 35 kilovolts peak between conductors and the shield as hereinafter described. The surge voltage must be developed from a capacitor discharge through a forming resistor connected in parallel with the dielectric of the test sample. The surge generator constants must be such as to produce a surge of 1.5 × 40 microseconds wave shape.

(c) The shape of the generated wave must be determined at a reduced voltage by connecting an oscilloscope across the forming resistor with the wire sample connected in parallel with the forming resistor. The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample. The test sample will be considered to have passed the test if there is no distinct change in the wave shape obtained with the initial reduced voltage compared to that obtained after the application of the test voltage.

(V) The following suggested formats may be used in submitting the test results to RUS:

Appendix B to § 1755.860—Sheath Slitting Cord Qualification

(I) The test procedures described in this appendix are for qualification of initial and subsequent changes in sheath slitting cords.

(II) *Sample Selection.* All testing must be performed on two 1.2 meters (4 feet) lengths of wire removed sequentially from the same 3 pair, 22 gauge jacketed wire. This wire must not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38 °C since its initial cool down after sheathing.

(III) *Test Procedure.* (1) Using a suitable tool, expose enough of sheath slitting cord to permit grasping with needle nose pliers.

(2) The prepared test specimens must be maintained at a temperature of 23 ±1 °C for at least 4 hours immediately prior to and during the test.

(3) Wrap the sheath slitting cord around the plier jaws to ensure a good grip.

(4) Grasp and hold the wire in a convenient position while gently and firmly pulling the sheath slitting cord longitudinally in the direction away from the wire end. The angle of pull may vary to any convenient and functional degree. A small starting notch is permissible.

(5) The sheath slitting cord is considered acceptable if the cord can slit the jacket and/or shield for a continuous length of 0.6 meter (2 feet) without breaking the cord.

Appendix C to § 1755.860—Thermal Reel Wrap Qualification

(I) The test procedures described in this appendix are for qualification of initial and subsequent changes in thermal reel wraps.

(II) *Sample Selection.* All testing must be performed on two 450 millimeter (18 inch) lengths of wire removed sequentially from the same 3 pair, 22 gauge jacketed wire. This wire must not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38 °C since its initial cool down after sheathing.

(III) *Test Procedure.* (1) Place the two samples on an insulating material such as wood, etc.

(2) Tape thermocouples to the jackets of each sample to measure the jacket temperature.

(3) Cover one sample with the thermal reel wrap.

(4) Expose the samples to a radiant heat source capable of heating the uncovered jacket sample to a minimum of 71 °C. A 600 watt photoflood lamp or an equivalent lamp having the light spectrum approximately that of the sun shall be used.

(5) The height of the lamp above the jacket shall be 380 millimeters (15 inches) or a height that produces the 71 °C jacket temperature on the unwrapped sample.

(6) After the samples have stabilized at the temperature, the jacket temperatures of the samples must be recorded after one hour of exposure to the heat source.

(7) Compute the temperature difference between the jackets.

(8) For the thermal reel wrap to be acceptable to RUS, the temperature differences between the jacket with the thermal reel wrap and the jacket without the reel wrap must be greater than or equal to 17 °C.
