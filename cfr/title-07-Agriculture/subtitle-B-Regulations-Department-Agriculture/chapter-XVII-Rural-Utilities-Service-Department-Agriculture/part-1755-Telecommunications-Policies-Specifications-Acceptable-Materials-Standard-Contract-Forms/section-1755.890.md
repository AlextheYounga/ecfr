##### § 1755.890 RUS specification for filled telephone cables with expanded insulation. #####

(a) *Scope.* (1) This section covers the requirements for filled telephone cables intended for direct burial installation either by trenching or by direct plowing, for underground application by placement in a duct, or for aerial installation by attachment to a support strand.

(i) The conductors are solid copper, individually insulated with an extruded cellular insulating compound which may be either totally expanded or expanded with a solid skin coating.

(ii) The insulated conductors are twisted into pairs which are then stranded or oscillated to form a cylindrical core.

(iii) For high frequency applications, the cable core may be separated into compartments with screening shields.

(iv) A moisture resistant filling compound is applied to the stranded conductors completely covering the insulated conductors and filling the interstices between pairs and units.

(v) The cable structure is completed by the application of suitable core wrapping material, a flooding compound, a shield or a shield/armor, and an overall plastic jacket.

(2) The number of pairs and gauge size of conductors which are used within the RUS program are provided in the following table:

(I) The test procedures described in this appendix are for qualification of initial cable designs and major modifications of accepted designs. Included in (V) of this appendix are suggested formats that may to be used in submitting test results to RUS.

(II) *Sample selection and preparation.* (1) All testing must be performed on lengths removed sequentially from the same 25 pair, 22 gauge jacketed cable. This cable must not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38 °C since its initial cool down after sheathing. The lengths specified are minimum lengths and if desirable from a laboratory testing standpoint longer lengths may be used.

(a) Length A must be 10 ±0.2 meters (33 ±0.5 feet) long and must be maintained at 23 ±3 °C. One length is required.

(b) Length B must be 12 ±0.2 meters (40 ±0.5 feet) long. Prepare the test sample by removing the jacket, shield or shield/armor, and core wrap for a sufficient distance on both ends to allow the insulated conductors to be flared out. Remove sufficient conductor insulation so that appropriate electrical test connections can be made at both ends. Coil the sample with a diameter of 15 to 20 times its sheath diameter. Three lengths are required.

(c) Length C must be one meter (3 feet) long. Four lengths are required.

(d) Length D must be 300 millimeters (1 foot) long. Four lengths are required.

(e) Length E must be 600 millimeters (2 feet) long. Four lengths are required.

(f) Length F must be 3 meters (10 feet) long and must be maintained at 23 ±3 °C for the duration of the test. Two lengths are required.

(2) *Data reference temperature.* Unless otherwise specified, all measurements must be made at 23 ±3 °C.

(III) *Environmental tests*—(1) *Heat aging test*—(a) *Test samples.* Place one sample each of lengths B, C, D, and E in an oven or environmental chamber. The ends of Sample B must exit from the chamber or oven for electrical tests. Securely seal the oven exit holes.

(b) *Sequence of tests.* The samples are to be subjected to the following tests after conditioning:

(i) Water Immersion Test outlined in (III)(2) of this appendix;

(ii) Water Penetration Test outlined in (III)(3) of this appendix;

(iii) Insulation Compression Test outlined in (III)(4) of this appendix; and

(iv) Jacket Slip Strength Test outlined in (III)(5) of this appendix.

(c) *Initial Measurements.* (i) For Sample B measure the open circuit capacitance for each odd numbered pair at 1, 150, and 772 kilohertz, and the attenuation at 150 and 772 kilohertz after conditioning the sample at the data reference temperature for 24 hours. Calculate the average and standard deviation for the data of the 13 pairs on a per kilometer or (on a per mile) basis.

(ii) The attenuation at 150 and 772 kilohertz may be calculated from open circuit admittance (Yoc) and short circuit impedance (Zsc) or may be obtained by direct measurement of attenuation.

(iii) Record on suggested formats in (V) of this appendix or on other easily readable formats.

(d) *Heat conditioning.* (i) Immediately after completing the initial measurements, condition the sample for 14 days at a temperature of 65 ±2 °C.

(ii) At the end of this period note any exudation of cable filler. Measure and calculate the parameters given in (III)(1)(c) of this appendix. Record on suggested formats in (V) of this appendix or other easily readable formats.

(iii) Cut away and discard a one meter (3 foot) section from each end of length B.

(e) *Overall electrical deviation.* (i) Calculate the percent change in all average parameters between the final parameters after conditioning and the initial parameters in (III)(1)(c) of this appendix.

(ii) The stability of the electrical parameters after completion of this test must be within the following prescribed limits:

(A) *Capacitance.* The average mutual capacitance must be within 5 percent of its original value;

(B) The change in average mutual capacitance must be less than 5 percent over frequency 1 to 150 kilohertz; and

(C) *Attenuation.* The 150 and 772 kilohertz attenuation must not have increased by more than 5 percent over their original values.

(2) *Water immersion electrical test*—(a) *Test sample selection.* The 10 meter (33 foot) section of length B must be tested.

(b) *Test sample preparation.* Prepare the sample by removing the jacket, shield or shield/armor, and core wrap for sufficient distance to allow one end to be accessed for test connections. Cut out a series of 6 millimeter (0.25 inch.) diameter holes along the test sample, at 30 centimeters (1 foot) intervals progressing successively 90 degrees around the circumference of the cable. Assure that the cable core is exposed at each hole by slitting the core wrapper. Place the prepared sample in a dry vessel which when filled will maintain a one meter (3 foot) head of water over 6 meters (20 feet) of uncoiled cable. Extend and fasten the ends of the cable so they will be above the water line and the pairs are rigidly held for the duration of the test.

(c) *Capacitance testing.* Measure the initial values of mutual capacitance of all odd pairs in each cable at a frequency of 1 kilohertz before filling the vessel with water. Be sure the cable shield or shield/armor is grounded to the test equipment. Fill the vessels until there is a one meter (3 foot) head of water on the cables.

(i) Remeasure the mutual capacitance after the cables have been submerged for 24 hours and again after 30 days.

(ii) Record each sample separately on suggested formats attached or on other easily readable formats.

(d) *Overall electrical deviation.* (i) Calculate the percent change in all average parameters between the final parameters after conditioning with the initial parameters in (III)(2)(c) of this appendix.

(ii) The average mutual capacitance must be within 5 percent of its original value.

(3) *Water penetration testing.* (a) A watertight closure must be placed over the jacket of length C. The closure must not be placed over the jacket so tightly that the flow of water through pre-existing voids of air spaces is restricted. The other end of the sample must remain open.

(b) Test per Option A or Option B—(i) *Option A.* Weigh the sample and closure prior to testing. Fill the closure with water and place under a continuous pressure of 10 ±0.7 kilopascals (1.5 ±0.1 pounds per square inch gauge) for one hour. Collect the water leakage from the end of the test sample during the test and weigh to the nearest 0.1 gram. Immediately after the one hour test, seal the ends of the cable with a thin layer of grease and remove all visible water from the closure, being careful not to remove water that penetrated into the core during the test. Reweigh the sample and determine the weight of water that penetrated into the core. The weight of water that penetrated into the core must not exceed 6 grams.

(ii) *Option B.* Fill the closure with a 0.2 gram sodium fluorscein per liter water solution and apply a continuous pressure 10 ±0.7 kilopascals (1.5 ±0.1 pounds per square inch gauge) for one hour. Catch and weigh any water that leaks from the end of the cable during the one hour period. If no water leaks from the sample, carefully remove the water from the closure. Then carefully remove the jacket, shield or shield/ armor, and core wrap one at a time, examining with an ultraviolet light source for water penetration. After removal of the core wrap, carefully dissect the core and examine for water penetration within the core. Where water penetration is observed, measure the penetration distance. The distance of water penetration into the core must not exceed 127 millimeters (5.0 inches).

(4) *Insulation compression test*—(a) *Test sample D.* Remove jacket, shield or shield/armor, and core wrap being careful not to damage the conductor insulation. Remove one pair from the core and carefully separate, wipe off core filler and straighten the insulated conductors. Retwist the two insulated conductors together under sufficient tension to form 10 evenly spaced 360 degree twists in a length of 10 centimeters (4 inches).

(b) *Sample testing.* Center the mid 50 millimeters (2 inches) of the twisted pair between 2 smooth rigid parallel metal plates that are 50 millimeters × 50 millimeters (2 inches × 2 inches). Apply a 1.5 volt direct current potential between the conductors, using a light or buzzer to indicate electrical contact between the conductors. Apply a constant load of 67 newtons (l5 pound-force) on the sample for one minute and monitor for evidence of contact between the conductors. Record results on suggested formats in (V) of this appendix or on other easily readable formats.

(5) *Jacket slip strength test*—(a) *Sample selection.* Test Sample E from (III)(1)(a) of this appendix.

(b) *Sample preparation.* Prepare test sample in accordance with the procedures specified in ASTM D 4565-90a.

(c) *Sample conditioning and testing.* Remove the sample from the tensile tester prior to testing and condition for one hour at 50 ±2 °C. Test immediately in accordance with the procedures specified in ASTM D 4565-90a. A minimum jacket slip strength of 67 newtons (15 pound-force) is required. Record the highest load attained.

(6) *Humidity exposure.* (a) Repeat steps (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(iii) of this appendix for separate set of samples B, C, D, and E which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.

(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, expose the test sample to 100 temperature cyclings. Relative humidity within the chamber must be maintained at 90 ±2 percent. One cycle consists of beginning at a stabilized chamber and test sample temperature of 52 ±1 °C, increasing the temperature to 57 ±1 °C, allowing the chamber and test samples to stabilize at this level, then dropping the temperature back to 52 ±1 °C.

(c) Repeat steps (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix.

(7) *Temperature cycling.* (a) Repeat steps (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(iii) of this appendix for separate set of samples B, C, D, and E which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.

(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, subject the test sample to the 10 cycles of temperature between a minimum of −40 °C and + 60 °C. The test sample must be held at each temperature extreme for a minimum of 11/2 hours during each cycle of temperature. The air within the temperature cycling chamber must be circulated throughout the duration of the cycling.

(c) Repeat steps (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix.

(IV) *Control sample*—(1) *Test samples.* A separate set of lengths A, C, D, E, and F must have been maintained at 23 ±3 °C for at least 48 hours before the testing.

(2) Repeat steps (III)(2) through (III)(5)(c) of this appendix except use length A instead of length B.

(3) *Surge test.* (a) One length of sample F must be used to measure the breakdown between conductors while the other length of F must be used to measure the core to shield breakdown.

(b) The samples must be capable of withstanding without damage, a single surge voltage of 15 kilovolts peak between conductors, and a 25 kilovolts peak surge voltage between conductors and the shield or shield/armor as hereinafter described. The surge voltage must be developed from a capacitor discharged through a forming resistor connected in parallel with the dielectric of the test sample. The surge generator constants must be such as to produce a surge of 1.5 × 40 microsecond wave shape.

(c) The shape of the generated wave must be determined at a reduced voltage by connecting an oscilloscope across the forming resistor with the cable sample connected in parallel with the forming resistor. The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample. The test sample will be considered to have passed the test if there is no distinct change in the wave shape obtained with the initial reduced voltage compared to that obtained after the application of the test voltage.
