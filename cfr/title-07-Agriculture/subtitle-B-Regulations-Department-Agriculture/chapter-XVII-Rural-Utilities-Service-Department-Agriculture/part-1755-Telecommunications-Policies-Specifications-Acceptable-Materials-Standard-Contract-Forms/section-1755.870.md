(7) A permissible overall performance level of faults in conductor insulation when using the test procedures in paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall average not greater than one fault per 12,000 conductor meters (40,000 conductor feet) for each gauge of conductor.

(8) The test used to determine compliance with paragraph (b)(7) of this section shall be conducted as follows:

(i) Samples tested shall be taken from finished cables selected at random from standard production cable. The samples tested shall contain a minimum of 300 conductor meters (1,000 conductor feet) for cables sizes less than 50 pairs and 1,500 conductor meters (5,000 conductor feet) for cables sizes greater than or equal to 50 pairs. No further sample need be taken from the same cable production run within 6,000 cable meters (20,000 cable feet) of the original test sample from that run.

(ii) The cable sample shall have its jacket, shield, and core wrap removed and its core shall be immersed in tap water for a minimum period of 6 hours. In lieu of removing the jacket, shield, and core wrap from the core, the entire cable may be tested. In this case, the core shall be completely filled with tap water, under pressure; then the cable assembly shall be immersed for a minimum period of 6 hours. With the cable core still fully immersed, except for end connections, the insulation resistance (IR) of all conductors to water shall be measured using a direct current (dc) voltage of 100 volts to 550 volts.

(iii) An IR value of less than 500 megohms for any individual insulated conductor tested at or corrected to a temperature of 23 °C is considered a failure. If the cable sample is more than 7.5 meters (25 feet) long, all failing conductors shall be retested and reported in 7.5 meter (25 foot) segments.

(iv) The pair count, gauge, footage, and number of insulation faults shall be recorded. This information shall be retained on a 6 month running basis for review by RUS when requested.

(v) A fault rate, in a continuous length in any one reel, in excess of one fault per 3,000 conductor meters (10,000 conductor feet) due to manufacturing defects is cause for rejection. A minimum of 6,000 conductor meters (20,000 conductor feet) is required to develop a noncompliance in a reel.

Prepare the test sample by removing the jacket, shield, and core wrap for a sufficient distance on both ends to allow the insulated conductors to be flared out. Remove sufficient conductor insulation so that appropriate electrical test connections can be made at both ends. Coil the sample with a diameter of 15 to 20 times its sheath diameter. Two lengths are required.

(b) Length B shall be 300 millimeters (1 foot) long. Three lengths are required.

Apply a constant load of 67 newtons (15 pound-force) on the sample for one minute and monitor for evidence of contact between the conductors. Record results on suggested formats in paragraph (V) of this appendix or on other easily readable formats.

(3) *Temperature Cycling.* (a) Repeat paragraphs (III)(1)(a) through (III)(1)(c)(ii) of this appendix for a separate set of samples A and B which have not been subjected to prior environmental conditioning.

(b) Immediately after completing the measurements, subject the test samples to 10 cycles of temperature between −40 °C and + 60 °C. The test samples shall be held at each temperature extreme for a minimum of 1.5 hours during each cycle of temperature. The air within the temperature cycling chamber shall be circulated throughout the duration of the cycling.

(c) Repeat paragraphs (III)(1)(d)(ii) through (III)(2)(b) of this appendix.

(IV) *Control Sample*—(1) *Test Samples.* One length of sample B shall have been maintained at 23 ±3 °C for at least 48 hours before the testing.

(2) Repeat paragraphs (III)(2) through (III)(2)(b) of this appendix.

(3) *Surge Test.* (a) One length of sample C shall be used to measure the breakdown between conductors while the other length of C shall be used to measure core to shield breakdown.

(b) The samples shall be capable of withstanding, without damage, a single surge voltage of 20 kilovolts peak between conductors, and 35 kilovolts peak between conductors and the shield as hereinafter described. The surge voltage shall be developed from a capacitor discharge through a forming resistor connected in parallel with the dielectric of the test sample. The surge generator constants shall be such as to produce a surge of 1.5 × 40 microseconds wave shape.

(c) The shape of the generated wave shall be determined at a reduced voltage by connecting an oscilloscope across the forming resistor with the cable sample connected in parallel with the forming resistor. The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample. The test sample shall be considered to have passed the test if there is no distinct change in the wave shape obtained with the initial reduced voltage compared to that obtained after the application of the test voltage.

(V) The following suggested formats may be used in submitting the test results to RUS:

Appendix B to § 1755.870—Sheath Slitting Cord Qualification

(I) This test procedure described in this appendix is for qualification of initial and subsequent changes in sheath slitting cords.

(II) *Sample selection.* All testing shall be performed on two 1.2 m (4 ft) lengths of cable removed sequentially from the same 25 pair, 22 gauge jacketed cable. This cable shall not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38 °C since its initial cool down after sheathing.

(III) *Test procedure.* (1) Using a suitable tool, expose enough of the sheath slitting cord to permit grasping with needle nose pliers.

(2) The prepared test specimens shall be maintained at a temperature of 23 ±1 °C for at least 4 hours immediately prior to and during the test.

(3) Wrap the sheath slitting cord around the plier jaws to ensure a good grip.

(4) Grasp and hold the cable in a convenient position while gently and firmly pulling the sheath slitting cord longitudinally in the direction away from the cable end. The angle of pull may vary to any convenient and functional degree. A small starting notch is permissible.

(5) The sheath slitting cord is considered acceptable if the cord can slit the jacket and/or shield for a continuous length of 0.6 m (2 ft) without breaking the cord.
