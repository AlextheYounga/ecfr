##### § 1785.66 General. #####

This subpart B sets forth policies and procedures on the RUS cushion of creditpayments program. The cushion of credit payments program will be maintained only for insured loans evidenced by obligations of the Fund. A subaccount within the Fund is hereby established for purposes of promoting rural economic development. It shall be known as the “Rural Economic Development Subaccount.” The assets of the subaccount shall be obtained from crediting (on a monthly basis) a sum determined by multiplying the outstanding cushion of credit payments made after October 1, 1987, by the difference (converted on a monthly basis) between the average weighted interest rate paid on outstanding certificates of beneficial ownership issued by the Fund and the 5 percent rate of interest provided to borrowers on cushion of credit payments, repayment of loans made pursuant to Section 313 of the Act, and other sources as provided by law. This subaccount shall be used to provide grants or zero interest loans to borrowers under the Act for the purpose of promoting rural economic development.
