##### § 1735.44 Prepayment premiums. #####

The loan documents normally provide that RUS insured loans may be repaid in full at any time without prepayment premiums. Depending upon the lender, there may be prepayment premiums on loans guaranteed by RUS. See 7 CFR part 1610 for prepayment premiums on RTB loans. See RUS Bulletin 320-12 for additional information. This CFR part supersedes those portions of RUS Bulletin 320-12, “Loan Payments and Statements”, with which it is in conflict.
