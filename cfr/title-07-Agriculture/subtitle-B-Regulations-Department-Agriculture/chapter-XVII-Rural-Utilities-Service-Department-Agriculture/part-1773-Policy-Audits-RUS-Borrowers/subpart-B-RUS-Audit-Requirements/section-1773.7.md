##### ยง 1773.7 Audit standards. #####

(a) The audit must be performed in accordance with GAGAS and this part. The audit must be performed in accordance with GAGAS in effect at the audit date unless the borrower is directed otherwise, in writing, by RUS.

(b) The audit must include such tests of the accounting records and such other auditing procedures that are sufficient to enable the CPA to express an opinion on the financial statements and to issue the required report on compliance and on internal control over financial reporting and the management letter.

(c) *Audit scope limitation.* (1) The borrower will not limit the scope of the audit to the extent that the CPA is unable to meet RUS's audit requirements or to provide an unqualified opinion that the financial statements are presented fairly in conformity with GAAP.

(2) The security instrument provision requiring the submission of a report of the audit is not satisfied if the CPA must qualify the opinion in the auditor's report due to limitations placed on the scope of the audit by the borrower.

(3) If the CPA determines during the audit that an unqualified opinion cannot be issued due to a scope limitation imposed by the borrower, the CPA should use professional judgment to determine what levels of the borrower's management should be informed.

(4) After informing the borrower's management, if the scope limitation is not adequately resolved, the CPA should immediately contact the AA-PARA, RUS, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250-1523. The AA-PARA will endeavor to resolve the matter with the borrower.
