##### ยง 1773.31 Auditor's report. #####

The CPA must prepare a written report on comparative balance sheets, statements of revenue and patronage capital (or income and retained earnings, depending upon the structure of the borrower) and statements of cash flows. This report must be signed by the CPA, cover all statements presented, and refer to the separate report on compliance and on internal control over financial reporting issued in conjunction with the auditor's report. The auditor's report should also state that the report on compliance and on internal control over financial reporting is an integral part of a GAGAS audit, and in considering the results of the audit, this report should be read along with the auditor's report on the financial statements.
