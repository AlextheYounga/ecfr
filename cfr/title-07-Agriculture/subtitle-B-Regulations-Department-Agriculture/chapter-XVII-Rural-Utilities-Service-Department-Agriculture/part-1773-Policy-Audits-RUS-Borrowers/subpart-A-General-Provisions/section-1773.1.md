##### § 1773.1 General. #####

(a) This part implements those standard provisions of the security instrument utilized by the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) for both electric and telecommunications borrowers and by the Rural Telephone Bank (RTB) for its telecommunications borrowers. The provisions require borrowers to prepare and furnish to RUS, at least once during each 12-month period, a full and complete report of its financial condition, operations, and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, audited and certified by an independent certified public accountant (CPA), satisfactory to RUS, and accompanied by a report of such audit, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS.

(b) This part 1773 applies to both RUS and RTB borrowers. For the purposes of RTB borrowers, as used in this part 1773, *RUS* means *RTB* and *Administrator* means *Governor* unless the text indicates otherwise.

(c) This complies with the 1994 revision of Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States, United States General Accounting Office, including amendments dated May 13, 1999, and July 30, 1999.

(d) An auditor's report, report on compliance and on internal control over financial reporting, and management letter are required to meet the reporting provisions of the RUS security instrument.

(1) The auditor's report must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).

(2) The management letter must state that the audit was conducted in accordance with this part.

(3) A report of the audit, in form and substance satisfactory to RUS, cannot be issued unless and until an audit has been performed in accordance with GAGAS and this part.

(4) A borrower is in violation of provisions of its security instrument with RUS if the borrower fails to provide an audit performed in compliance with GAGAS and this part. RUS security instruments normally provide for notice and an opportunity to cure such violations before RUS can exercise certain remedies.

(5) A report prepared in connection with a review or compilation of financial statements, as defined in Statement of Standards for Accounting and Review Services No. 1, Compilation and Review of Financial Statements, does not satisfy the requirements of the RUS security instrument.

(6) A report, as described in Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 62, entitled “Special Reports”, or in SAS No. 75, entitled “Engagements to Apply Agreed-upon Procedures to Specified Elements, Accounts, or Items of a Financial Statement”, does not satisfy the RUS loan security instrument requirements.

(7) An annual report containing audited financial statements does not satisfy the RUS security instrument requirements.

(e) This part further implements those provisions of the standard RUS security instrument by setting forth the criteria for CPAs to be deemed satisfactory to RUS and the audit procedures and documentation standards that must be performed before a report of the audit satisfactory to RUS can be prepared and issued.
