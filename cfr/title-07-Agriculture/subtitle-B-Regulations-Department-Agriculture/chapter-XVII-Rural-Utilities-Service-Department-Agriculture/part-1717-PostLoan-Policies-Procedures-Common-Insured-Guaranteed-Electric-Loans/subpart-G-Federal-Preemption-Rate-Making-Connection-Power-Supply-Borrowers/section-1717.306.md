##### ยง 1717.306 RUS required rates. #####

(a) Upon the publication in the Federal Register of the notice of pre-emption of state regulatory authority as provided in this subpart, RUS will exercise exclusive jurisdiction over the rates of the borrower pursuant to the terms of the RUS documents. The borrower shall immediately establish rates with the approval of RUS that are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the RUS wholesale power contract and other RUS documents described in ยง 1717.303 of this subpart. The borrower shall establish such rates notwithstanding provisions of state law, and rules, orders or other actions of state regulatory authorities, and notwithstanding any provision of the RUS documents referring to such laws, rules, orders or actions.

(b) So long as the state regulatory authority shall be pre-empted hereunder, RUS shall be considered the governmental regulatory body with jurisdiction over rates for the purposes of the RUS documents and for the purposes of section 1129(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as amended (11 U.S.C. 1129(a)(6)).

(c) If a borrower, which is subject to exclusive RUS rate jurisdiction, shall fail to establish rates in accordance with terms of the RUS wholesale power contract and other RUS documents in a timely fashion, RUS may proceed to exercise any and all rights and remedies available pursuant under the RUS documents or otherwise.

(d) The jurisdiction of the state regulatory authority over the rates of the borrower shall continue to be pre-empted hereunder until the Administrator shall in writing approve the resumption of jurisdiction by the state regulatory authority and publish in the Federal Register a notice to such effect. The Administrator shall approve resumption only after determining that such jurisdiction shall be exercised in a manner consistent with Federal interests.
