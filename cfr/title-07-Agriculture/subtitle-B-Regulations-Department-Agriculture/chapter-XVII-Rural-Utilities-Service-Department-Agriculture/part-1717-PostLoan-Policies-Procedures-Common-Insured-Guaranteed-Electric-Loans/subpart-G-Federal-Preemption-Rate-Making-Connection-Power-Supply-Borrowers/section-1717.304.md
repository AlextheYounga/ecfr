##### ยง 1717.304 State regulatory authority rate jurisdiction. #####

(a) In the event that rate revisions required by the terms of the RUS wholesale power contract or other RUS documents may be subject to the approval of a state regulatory authority, the power supply borrower shall seek such required approval in a timely manner.

(b) RUS recognizes the need of state regulatory authorities for documents, information and records for use in connection with an application for rate approval and will consider any reasonable request by a borrower or a state regulatory authority for such documents, information and records. The failure of RUS to provide requested documents, information or records shall not limit any rights of RUS including the right with respect to pre-emption of the state regulatory authority as provided in this subpart.

(c) In the event that the state regulatory authority shall fail to act favorably upon the borrower's application for rate increases required by terms of the RUS wholesale power contract or other RUS documents, the borrower shall pursue such legal and administrative appeals as may be available to it, unless RUS shall approve otherwise in writing.
