##### ยง 1779.94 Determination and payment of loss. #####

In all liquidation cases, final settlement will be made with the lender after the collateral is liquidated. The Agency will have the right to recover losses paid under the guarantee from any liable party.

(a) *General.* If the lender takes title to collateral, any loss will be based on the collateral value at the time the lender obtains title.

(b) *Loss calculations.* The Report of Loss form (available in any Agency office) will be used for calculations of all estimated and final loss determinations. Estimated loss payments may only be approved after the lender has submitted a liquidation plan approved by the Agency.

(c) *Estimated loss payments.* When the lender is conducting the liquidation and owns any of the guaranteed portion of the loan, it may request an estimated loss payment by submitting an estimate of loss that will occur in connection with liquidation of the loan. An estimated loss payment may be approved after the Agency has approved the liquidation plan.

(1) The lender will prepare and submit a Report of Loss using the appraised value in lieu of amount received from sale of collateral.

(2) The estimated loss payment shall be calculated as of the date of such payment. The total amount of the loss payment remitted by the Agency will be applied by the lender on the guaranteed portion of the loan debt. Such application does not release the borrower from liability. At the time of final loss settlement, the lender may notify the borrower that the loss payment has been so applied.

(3) After liquidation has been completed, a final Report of Loss will be submitted by the lender to the Agency.

(d) *Final report of loss.* In all cases, a final Report of Loss must be submitted to the Agency. Before Agency approval of any final loss report, the lender must account for all funds obtained, disposition of the collateral, all costs incurred, and any other information necessary for the successful completion of liquidation. Upon receipt of the final accounting and Report of Loss, the Agency may conduct an audit and will determine the final loss. The lender will make its records available to, and otherwise assist, the Agency in making any audit it requires of the Report of Loss. The documentation accompanying the Report of Loss must support the loss claimed.

(1) The lender must document and show that all of the collateral has been accounted for and properly liquidated and that liquidation proceeds have been properly accounted for and applied correctly on the loan. The Agency must be satisfied that the lender has accomplished this in the manner contained herein and that the lender has maximized the collections in conducting the liquidation.

(2) The lender must show a breakdown on any protective advance amount as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, evidence that the amount expended was proper, and that the amount was actually paid.

(3) The lender must show a breakdown of liquidation expenses as to the payee, purpose of the expenditure, date paid, evidence that the amount expended was proper, and that the amount was actually paid.

(4) Accrued interest should be supported by attachments showing how the amount was accrued by the lender. A copy of the promissory note and ledger will be attached. If the interest rate was a variable rate, the lender must include documentation of changes in the selected base rate and when the changes in the loan rate became effective.

(e) *Liquidation income.* Any net rental or other income that has been received by the lender from the collateral will be applied on the guaranteed loan debt.

(f) *Liquidation costs.* Certain reasonable liquidation costs will be allowed during the liquidation process. The liquidation costs must be submitted as a part of the liquidation plan. Such costs will be deducted from gross proceeds received from the disposition of collateral unless the costs have been previously determined by the lender (with Agency concurrence) to be protective advances. If changed circumstances after submission of the liquidation plan require a revision of liquidation costs, the lender will obtain the Agency's written concurrence prior to proceeding with the proposed changes. No in-house expenses of the lender will be allowed.

(g) *Protective advance losses.* In those instances where the lender made authorized protective advances, the lender may claim recovery for the guaranteed portion of any loss of monies advanced as well as interest resulting from such protective advances. These claims shall be included in the final Report of Loss.

(h) *Final loss approval.* After the final Report of Loss has been tentatively approved:

(1) If the actual loss is greater than any estimated loss payment, such loss will be paid by the Agency;

(2) If the actual loss is less than any estimated loss payment, the lender will reimburse the Agency;

(3) If the Agency conducted the liquidation, it will provide an accounting to the lender and will pay the lender in accordance with the Loan Note Guarantee.

(i) *Loss limits.* The amount payable by the Agency to the lender cannot exceed the limits contained in the Loan Note Guarantee. If the Agency conducts the liquidation, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered by the guarantee only to the date the Agency accepts this responsibility. When the liquidation is conducted by the lender, loss occasioned by accruing interest will be covered to the extent of the guarantee to the date of final settlement provided the lender proceeds expeditiously with the liquidation plan approved by the Agency.
