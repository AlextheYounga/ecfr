##### § 1779.48 Collateral. #####

(a) *Lender responsibility.* The lender is responsible for obtaining and maintaining proper and adequate collateral to protect the interest of the lender, the holder, and the Government.

(b) *Type of collateral.* Collateral must be of such a nature that repayment of the loan is reasonably ensured when considered with the integrity and ability of project management, soundness of the project, and the borrower's prospective earnings. The collateral may include, but is not limited to, the following: General obligation bonds, revenue bonds, pledge of taxes or assessments, assignment of facility revenue, land, easements, rights-of-way, water rights, buildings, machinery, equipment, accounts receivable, contracts, cash, or other accounts or assignments of leases or leasehold interest.

(c) *Separate collateral.* All collateral must secure the entire loan. The lender will not take separate security to secure only the unguaranteed portion of the loan. The lender will not require compensating balances or certificates of deposit as a means of eliminating the lender's exposure on the unguaranteed portion of the loan.
