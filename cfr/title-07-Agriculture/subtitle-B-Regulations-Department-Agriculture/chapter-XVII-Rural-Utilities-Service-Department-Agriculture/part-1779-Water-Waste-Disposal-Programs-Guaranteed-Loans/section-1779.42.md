(a) *Architectural and engineering practices.* All project facilities must be designed utilizing accepted architectural and engineering practices and must conform to applicable Federal, State, and local codes and requirements. The lender must ensure that the planned project will be completed within the available funds and, once completed, will be suitable for the borrower's needs.
