(a) *Lender's Agreement.* If the Agency finds that all requirements have been met, the lender and the Agency will execute the Lender's Agreement. The original will be retained by the Agency and a signed duplicate original will be retained by the lender. A separate Lender's Agreement must be executed for each loan to be guaranteed by the Agency.

(b) *Loan Note Guarantee.* (1) Upon receipt of the executed Lender's Agreement and after all requirements have been met, the Agency will execute the Loan Note Guarantee. All originals of the Loan Note Guarantee will be provided to the lender and attached to the note.

(2) If the lender has selected the multi-note system, a Loan Note Guarantee will be prepared and attached to each note the borrower issues. All the notes will be listed on the Loan Note Guarantee. Not more than ten notes will be issued for the guaranteed portion (unless the Agency and borrower agree otherwise) and one note issued for the unguaranteed portion.

(c) *Assignment of Guarantee.* In the event the lender assigns the guaranteed portion of the loan to a holder, the lender, holder, and Agency will execute an Agency prescribed Assignment Guarantee Agreement.

(d) *Failure to meet conditions.* If the Agency determines that it cannot execute the Loan Note Guarantee because all requirements have not been met, the lender will have a reasonable period within which to satisfy the objections. If the lender satisfies the objections within the time allowed, the guarantee will be issued.

(e) *Loan closing report.* The lender will prepare and deliver a guaranteed loan closing report for each loan to be guaranteed and a guarantee fee to the Agency in return for the Loan Note Guarantee.
