##### § 1779.4 Conditions of guarantee. #####

A loan guarantee under this part will be evidenced by a Loan Note Guarantee issued by the Agency. Each lender will also execute a Lender's Agreement.

(a) The entire loan will be secured by the same security with equal lien priority for the guaranteed and non-guaranteed portions of the loan. The non-guaranteed portion of the loan will not be paid first nor given any preference or priority over the guaranteed portion.

(b) The lender will be responsible for servicing the entire loan and will remain mortgagee or secured party of record notwithstanding the fact that another party may hold a portion of the loan.

(c) When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold to a holder, the holder shall have all rights of the lender under the Loan Note Guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The lender will remain bound by all the obligations under the Loan Note Guarantee, Lender's Agreement, and Agency program regulations. If the Agency makes a payment to a holder, then the lender must reimburse the Agency.

(d) A lender will receive all payments of principal and interest on the account of the entire loan and will promptly remit to each holder a pro rata share, less any lender servicing fee.

(e) The lender may retain all of the unguaranteed portion of the loan or may sell part of the unguaranteed portion of the loan through participation. However, the lender is required to retain 5 percent of the loan amount from the unguaranteed portion in their portfolio.
