##### § 1779.89 Mergers. #####

(a) *General.* The Agency may approve mergers or consolidations (herein referred to as “mergers”) when the resulting organization will be eligible for an Agency guaranteed loan and assumes all the liabilities and acquires all the assets of the merged borrower. Mergers may be approved when:

(1) The merger is in the best interest of the Government and the merging borrower;

(2) The resulting borrower can meet all required conditions as contained in specific loan note agreements; and

(3) All property can be legally transferred to the resulting borrower.

(b) *Distinguishing mergers from transfers and assumptions.* Mergers occur when one entity combines with another entity in such a way that the first entity ceases to exist as a separate entity while the other continues. In a consolidation, two or more entities combine to form a new, consolidated entity with the original entity ceasing to exist. Such transactions must be distinguished from transfers and assumptions in which a transferor will not necessarily go out of existence, and the transferee will not always take all the transferor's assets nor assume all the transferor's liabilities.
