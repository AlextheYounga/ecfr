##### ยง 1738.251 Loan offer and loan closing. #####

The Agency will notify the applicant of the loan offer, in writing, and the date by which the applicant must accept the offer. If the applicant accepts the terms of the loan offer, a loan contract executed by the Agency will be sent to the applicant. The applicant must execute the loan contract and satisfy all conditions precedent to loan closing within the timeframe specified by the Agency. If the conditions are not met within this timeframe, the loan offer will be terminated, unless the applicant requests, and the Agency approves, an extension. The Agency may approve such a request if the applicant has diligently sought to meet the conditions required for loan closing and has been unable to do so for reasons outside its control.
