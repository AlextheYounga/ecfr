##### ยง 1738.205 Notification of completeness. #####

If all proposed funded service areas are eligible, the Agency will review the application for completeness. The completeness review will include an assessment of whether all required documents and information have been submitted and whether the information provided is of adequate quality to allow further analysis.

(a) If the application contains all documents and information required by this part and is sufficient, in form and substance acceptable to the Agency, the Agency will notify the applicant, in writing, that the application is complete. A notification of completeness is not a commitment that the loan will be approved. By submitting an application, the applicant acknowledges that no obligation to enter into a loan exists until actual loan documents have been executed.

(b) If the application is considered to be incomplete or inadequate, the Agency will notify the applicant, in writing, that the application has been rejected. The rejection letter will include an explanation of the reasons for rejection.
