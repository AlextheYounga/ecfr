Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 36198, July 9, 2021.

(a) *Contract forms.* The borrower must use RUS Form 830, Electric System Construction Contract - Project Construction, for construction of substations, except for minor modifications or improvements.

(b) *Procurement procedures.* (1) It is the responsibility of each borrower to determine the procurement method that best meets its needs to award contracts not requiring RUS approval in amounts of up to a cumulative total of $750,000 or one percent of NUP (not to exceed $5,000,000), whichever is greater, per calendar year of substation and transmission line construction (including minor modifications or improvements), exclusive of the cost of owner furnished materials and equipment.

(2) The borrower shall use formal competitive bidding for all other contract construction, including all contracts requiring RUS approval. The amount of contracts bid using the formal competitive bidding procedure do not apply to the cumulative total stipulated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) An amendment which increases the scope of the contract by adding a project is not considered competitively bid, therefore, the amount of that amendment does apply to the cumulative total stipulated in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(c) *Contract approval.* Individual contracts in the amount of $750,000 or more or one percent of NUP (not to exceed $1,500,000 for distribution borrowers or $4,500,000 for power supply borrowers), whichever is greater, exclusive of the cost of owner furnished materials and equipment, are subject to RUS approval.
