##### § 1726.251 Prior approved contract modification related to price escalation on transmission equipment, generation equipment, and generation construction contracts. #####

(a) *General.* Where the borrower encounters reluctance among manufacturers, suppliers, and contractors to bid a firm price on transmission equipment or generation equipment, materials or construction, modifications may be made in the RUS standard form of contracts. These modifications, if applicable, may include, as an alternative to the standard form, provisions for adjusting a base price either upward or downward as determined by changes in specified indexes between the time of the bid and the time the work is performed or materials are procured by the contractor for such work. A large number of labor and materials indexes are published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The borrower (acting through its engineer, if applicable) will select the indexes for the particular item to be used in the price adjustment clause. Suppliers' corporate indexes may not be used. Labor and materials indexes are reported in the BLS's monthly publications entitled “Employment and Earnings” and “Producer Prices and Price Indexes.” These publications may be ordered through the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, or any of the BLS regional offices.

(b) *Material and equipment contracts.* The approved provisions needed to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the material or equipment contract forms for generation facilities are as follows:

(1) Insert new paragraphs in the Notice and Instructions to Bidders as follows:

“Proposals are invited on the basis of firm prices (or prices with a stated maximum percentage escalation) or on the basis of nonfirm prices to be adjusted as provided for below or on both bases. The owner may award the contract on either basis.

*Nonfirm prices.* The prices are subject to adjustment upward or downward based on change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and material indexes.

A proportion of \_\_\_\_ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent labor cost and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate\_\_\_\_ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in which the labor is incorporated in the equipment or materials. The adjustment for labor costs shall be obtained by applying the percentage of increase or decrease in such index, calculated to the nearest one-tenth of one percent, to the percentage of the contract prices deemed to represent labor costs. A portion of \_\_\_\_ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent material costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, material index \_\_\_\_ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] for the period and in a manner similar to the labor cost adjustment.”

(2) Insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:

“Firm Price $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Nonfirm Price $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”

(3) For equipment that uses a large quantity of insulating oil, the borrower may insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:

“The price for insulating oil shall be adjusted upward or downward based on the change in the Bureau of Labor Statistics Refined Petroleum Rate (057) from the month in which the bids are opened to the month in which the oil is purchased by the equipment supplier. Contracts shall be evaluated based on an estimated cost of \_\_\_\_ cents per gallon [the borrower will enter the appropriate cost] for oil. Such adjustment, if any, shall not change the contract amount for purpose of applying any other adjustments to the contract prices.”

(c) *Construction contracts.* The approved provisions needed to reflect the modifications to provide for price escalation in the construction contract forms for generation facilities are as follows:

(1) Insert new paragraphs in the “Notice and Instructions” to Bidders as follows:

“Proposals are invited on the basis of firm prices (or prices with a stated maximum percentage escalation) or on the basis of nonfirm prices to be adjusted as provided for below or on both bases. The owner may award the contract on either basis.

*Nonfirm Prices*—The prices are subject to adjustment upward or downward based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics labor and material indexes.

A proportion of \_\_\_\_ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent shop labor costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate \_\_\_\_ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] from the month in which bids are opened to the month in which the work is accomplished. The adjustment for shop labor costs shall be obtained by applying the percentage increase or decrease in such index, to the percentage of each partial payment deemed to represent shop labor costs. A portion of \_\_\_\_ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract prices shall be deemed to represent material costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Producer Price Index, \_\_\_\_ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index] for the period and in a manner similar to the shop labor costs adjustment. A portion of \_\_\_\_ percent [the borrower will enter the appropriate percentage amount] of the contract price shall be deemed to represent field labor costs and shall be adjusted based on changes in the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Average Hourly Earnings Rate \_\_\_\_ [the borrower will enter the appropriate BLS index], for the period and in a manner similar to the shop labor costs adjustment.”

(2) Insert the following in the contract documents under the “Proposal” section:

“Firm Price $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Nonfirm Price $\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_”
