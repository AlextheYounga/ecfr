This section is applicable to contracts executed on RUS Forms 200, 257, 786, and 830.

(a) *Final test of equipment supplied under a construction contract.* If equipment is supplied under a construction contract, the borrower (acting through its architect or engineer, if applicable) will perform the final inspection and testing of equipment as appropriate for the specific equipment. The borrower (acting through its architect or engineer, if applicable) will schedule such inspection and testing at a time mutually agreeable to the borrower, architect or engineer, and the contractor. Within thirty (30) days after completion of the inspection and testing, the borrower (acting through its architect or engineer, if applicable) will prepare a report of the inspection and testing, obtain a copy of the report from its architect or engineer, and submit a copy to the contractor. This report must include a detailed description of the methods of conducting the test(s), observed data, comparison of guaranteed and actual performance, and recommendations concerning acceptance. The borrower will obtain from its architect or engineer a written certification stating that the equipment has been installed, placed in satisfactory operation and tested, and meets the contract requirements. Where more than one-hundred and eighty (180) days have elapsed since the delivery of the equipment and the equipment has not been installed or tested, the contract may be closed out upon certification by its architect or engineer that the equipment has been inspected and appears to be in accordance with the contract requirements.

(b) *Final inspection of construction.* The borrower will require the contractor to notify the architect or engineer when construction is complete. The borrower (acting through the architect or engineer, if applicable) will schedule such final inspection at a time mutually agreeable to the borrower, architect or engineer, contractor, and the respective RUS General Field Representative (GFR), if the GFR has notified the borrower or its architect or engineer of a desire to observe the final inspection. The borrower (acting through its architect or engineer, if applicable) will perform a final inspection of the construction and notify the contractor of any required changes or corrections.

(c) *Closeout documents.* (1) Upon satisfactory completion of construction (including all changes and corrections by the contractor), the borrower (acting through its architect or engineer, if applicable) will obtain executed copies of the following documents:

The borrower will send one copy of RUS Form 187 to RUS for information prior to or in conjunction with the applicable RUS Form 219, Inventory of Work Orders. The remaining closeout documents need not be sent to RUS unless specifically requested by RUS.
