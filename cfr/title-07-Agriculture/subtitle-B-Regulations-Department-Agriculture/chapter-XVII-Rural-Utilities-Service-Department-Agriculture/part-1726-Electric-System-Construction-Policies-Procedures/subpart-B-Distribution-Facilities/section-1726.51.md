(2) The borrower must use RUS Form 830, Electric System Construction Contract - Project Construction, for all other distribution line construction.

(b) *Procurement procedures.* (1) It is the responsibility of each borrower to determine the procurement method that best meets its needs to award contracts in amounts of up to a cumulative total of $750,000 or one percent of NUP, whichever is greater, per calendar year of distribution line construction (including minor modifications or improvements), exclusive of the cost of owner furnished materials and equipment.
