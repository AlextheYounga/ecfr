Endorsement Waiving Immunity From Tort Liability” be included as a part of each public liability, owned, non-owned, hired automobile, and aircraft liability, employers' liability policy, and boiler policy:

The Insurer agrees with the Rural Utilities Service that such insurance as is afforded by the policy applies subject to the following provisions:

1. The Insurer agrees that it will not use, either in the adjustment of claims or in the defense of suits against the Insured, the immunity of the Insured from tort liability, unless requested by the Insured to interpose such defense.

2. The Insured agrees that the waiver of the defense of immunity shall not subject the Insurer to liability of any portion of a claim, verdict or judgment in excess of the limits of liability stated in the policy.

3. The Insurer agrees that if the Insured is relieved of liability because of its immunity, either by interposition of such defense at the request of the Insured or by voluntary action of a court, the insurance applicable to the injuries on which such suit is based, to the extent to which it would otherwise have been available to the Insured, shall apply to officers and employees of the Insured in their capacity as such; provided that all defenses other than immunity from tort liability which would be available to the Insurer but for said immunity in suits against the Insured or against the Insurer under the policy shall be available to the Insurer with respect to such officers and employees in suits against such officers and employees or against the Insurer under the policy.
