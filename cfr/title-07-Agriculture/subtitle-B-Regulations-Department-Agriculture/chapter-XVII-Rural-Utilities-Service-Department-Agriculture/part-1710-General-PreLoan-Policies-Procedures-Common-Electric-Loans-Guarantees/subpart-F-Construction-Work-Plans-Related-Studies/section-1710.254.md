##### § 1710.254 Alternative sources of power. #####

(a) *General.* (1) RUS will make loans to finance the construction of generation facilities by distribution or power supply borrowers and transmission facilities by power supply borrowers only under the following conditions if said borrowers do not already own and operate such types of facilities:

(i) Where no adequate and dependable source of power is available to meet the consumers' needs; or

(ii) Where the rates offered by other power sources would result in a higher cost of power to the consumers than the cost from facilities financed by RUS, and the amount of the power cost savings that would result from the RUS-financed facilities bears a significant relationship to the amount of the proposed loan.

(2) If a borrower already owns and operates the types of facilities included in a loan request, then a loan for the purposes contained in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, as well as for the construction of transmission facilities by a distribution borrower, will be considered and evaluated by RUS in terms of whether the proposed facilities constitute an effective and economical means of meeting the power requirements of the consumers. A borrower shall contact RUS as soon as practicable in order for RUS to review information submitted by the borrower and advise the borrower, in writing, whether there is a need for the borrower to investigate and seek alternative sources of power. RUS will determine, based on information provided by the borrower or otherwise available, whether there is a need to investigate alternative sources of power or whether RUS will require information or other methods of determining the need for the generation capacity. RUS will base its determination on whether RUS is able to conclude that the project is needed, the borrower would incur delays and costs in pursuing an RFP, or that an RFP is not likely to produce new alternatives to the project.

(b) Loan requests for the addition of generation capacity, including replacement of existing capacity, will be accepted by RUS when the applicant has completed the requirements established by RUS, in a manner satisfactory to RUS. The investigations of alternative sources of power must be coordinated in advance with RUS. This section applies to RUS financed generation capacity whether owned solely by the borrower, owned on an undivided ownership basis with other utilities or substantially controlled by the borrower.

(c) The applicant may be required to seek and utilize capacity available from RUS borrowers and other organizations before developing plans for additional generation capacity. RUS may require, on a case by case basis, that the applicant, among other things:

(1) Solicit power and energy purchase proposals from all reasonable potential sources of power, such as other electric cooperatives, investor-owned utilities, municipal utility organizations, and Federal and state power authorities.

(2) Solicit proposals from independent power producers, including co-generators, to determine the terms and conditions under which these producers can supply the additional power and energy needs of the applicant, without RUS financial assistance. Such solicitations should be placed in at least three national newspapers or trade publications, and they meet all planning, coordination or other requirements imposed by state authorities, as well as the environmental requirements of RUS.

(d) When solicitations are received in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the applicant will evaluate all alternative proposals on an economic, present-value basis, giving consideration to cost-effectiveness, reliability of service, the short-term and long-term financial viability of the supplier, and the financial risk to the borrower and its creditors. The applicant will keep RUS fully informed on these evaluations and provide supporting information and analysis as requested by RUS.

(e) After evaluation of all proposals received in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, and having informed RUS of the results, the applicant may be required to negotiate final proposals with the entities submitting the best acceptable offers. Contracts requiring RUS approval will either be approved in advance by the Administrator or contain a provision that the contract is not valid until approved, in writing, by the Administrator. The Administrator will approve the contracts in a timely manner provided that the borrower has met all applicable requirements, including, among other matters, evidence that the alternative source of power selected is an economical and effective alternative.

(f) RUS may make independent inquiries with potential power suppliers as to the availability of power to meet borrowers' needs. Information developed by RUS will be shared with borrowers at their request.

(g) Further details of RUS requirements for financing of generation and bulk transmission facilities are set forth in 7 CFR part 1712.

(h) At the request of a borrower, RUS, in its sole discretion, may waive specific requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section if such waiver is required to prevent unreasonable delays in obtaining generation capacity that could result in system reliability problems.
