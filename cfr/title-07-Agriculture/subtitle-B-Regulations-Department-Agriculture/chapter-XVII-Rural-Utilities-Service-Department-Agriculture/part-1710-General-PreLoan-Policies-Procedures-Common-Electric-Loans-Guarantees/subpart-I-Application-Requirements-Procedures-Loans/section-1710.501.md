The date on page 1 of the form is the beginning date of the loan period and shall be the same as the date on the Financial and Statistical Report submitted with the application (paragraph (a)(5) of this section). Form 740c also includes the following information, exhibits, and attachments:

See 7 CFR 1714.7(c) and 1714.8(d). This breakdown must indicate the method used by the borrower for allocating loan funds between urban and non urban consumers.

A restated mortgage, or a mortgage supplement will be required if there has been a material change to the real property owned by the borrower since the most recent RUS loan, loan guarantee, or lien accommodation, if the requested loan would cause the borrower to exceed its previously authorized debt limit, or if RUS otherwise determines it necessary. If there has been no material change to the real property owned by the borrower since the most recent RUS loan or loan guarantee, the borrower must submit an opinion of its counsel to that effect. If a new or restated mortgage or a mortgage supplement is required, the borrower must provide the following:
