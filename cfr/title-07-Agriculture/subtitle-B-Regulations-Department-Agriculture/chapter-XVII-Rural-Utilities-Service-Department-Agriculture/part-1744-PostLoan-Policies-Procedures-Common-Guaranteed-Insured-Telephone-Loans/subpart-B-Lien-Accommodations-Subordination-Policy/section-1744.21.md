*Weighted-average life of the loans or notes* means the average life of the loans or notes based on the proportion of original loan principal paid during each year of the loans or notes. It shall be determined by calculating the sum of all loan or note principal payments expressed as a fraction of the original loan or note principal amount, times the number of years and fractions of years elapsed at the time of each payment since issuance of the loan or note. For example, given a $5 million loan, with a maturity of 5 years and equal principal payments of $1 million due on the anniversary date of the loan, the weighted-average life would be: (.2)(1 year) + (.2)(2 years) + (.2)(3 years) + (.2)(4 years) + (.2)(5 years) = .2 years + .4 years + .6 years + .8 years + 1.0 years = 3.0 years. If instead the loan had a balloon payment of $5 million at the end of 5 years, the weighted-average life would be: ($5 million/$5 million)(5 years) = 5 years.

*Weighted-average remaining life of the loans or notes* means the remaining average life of the loans or notes based on the proportion of remaining loan or note principal expressed in years remaining to maturity of the loans or notes.

*Weighted-average remaining useful life of the assets* means the estimated original average life of the assets to be acquired with the proceeds of the private lender notes expressed in years based on depreciation rates less the number of years those assets have been in service (or have been depreciated). It shall be determined by calculating the sum of each asset's remaining value expressed as a fraction of the total remaining value of the assets, times the estimated number of years and fraction of years remaining until the assets are fully depreciated.

*Wholly-owned subsidiary* means a corporation owned 100 percent by the borrower.
