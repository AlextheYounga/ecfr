Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 7565, Feb. 6, 2023.

The auditor must prepare a written report on comparative balance sheets, statements of revenue and patronage capital (or statement of operations customary to the type of entity reporting) and statements of cash flows. The report must include the manual or printed signature of the auditor, cover all statements presented, and refer to the separate report on internal controls over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters and the report on compliance with aspects of contractual agreements and regulatory requirements issued in conjunction with the auditor's report on the financial statements. The auditor's report on the financial statements should also state that the report on internal controls over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters is an integral part of a GAGAS audit, and in considering the results of the audit, that this report should be read along with the auditor's report on the financial statements.
