##### § 1714.56 Fund advance period. #####

(a) For loans approved on or after February 21, 1995, the fund advance period begins on the date of the loan note and is one year longer than the loan period, but not less than 4 years. For example, the fund advance period for a loan with a 2-year loan period terminates automatically 4 years after the date of the loan note; a loan with a 4-year loan period terminates automatically 5 years after the date of the loan note. The Administrator may extend the fund advance period on any loan if the borrower meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. As defined in 7 CFR 1710.2, the loan period begins on the date shown on page 1 of RUS Form 740c submitted with the loan application.

(b) For loans approved on or after June 1, 1984, and before February 21, 1995, the fund advance period begins on the date of the loan contract, or the most recent amendment thereto, and terminates automatically 4 years from the date of the loan contract, or the most recent amendment thereto, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.

(c) The Administrator may agree to an extension of the fund advance period for loans approved on or after June 1, 1984, if the borrower demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the loan funds continue to be needed for approved loan purposes (i.e., facilities included in an RUS approved construction work plan). Policies for extension of the fund advance period following certain mergers, consolidations, and transfers of systems substantially in their entirety are set forth in 7 CFR 1717.156.

(1) To apply for an extension, the borrower must send to RUS, at least 120 days before the automatic termination date, the following:

(i) A certified copy of a board resolution requesting an extension of the Government's obligation to advance loan funds;

(ii) Evidence that the unadvanced loan funds continue to be needed for approved loan purposes; and

(iii) Notice of the estimated date for completion of construction.

(2) In the case of financial hardship, as determined by the Administrator, RUS may agree to an extension of the fund advance period even though the borrower has failed to meet the 120-day requirement of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(3) If the Administrator approves a request for an extension, RUS will notify the borrower in writing of the extension and the terms and conditions thereof. An extension will be effective only if it is obtained in writing prior to the automatic termination date.

(d) Advances of funds from loans approved before June 1, 1984, are generally made during the first 6 years of the note.

(e) RUS will rescind the balance of any loan funds not advanced to a borrower as of the final date approved for advancing funds.
