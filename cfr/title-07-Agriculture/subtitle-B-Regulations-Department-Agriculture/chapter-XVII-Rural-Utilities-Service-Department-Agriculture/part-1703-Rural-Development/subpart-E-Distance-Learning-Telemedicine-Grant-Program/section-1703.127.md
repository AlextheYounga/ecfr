##### § 1703.127 Application selection provisions. #####

(a) Applications will be selected for approval based on scores assigned, availability of funds, and the provisions of this section. RUS will make determinations regarding the reasonableness of all numbers; dollar levels; rates; the nature and design of the project; costs; location; and other characteristics of the application and the project to determine the number of points assigned to a grant application for all selection criteria.

(b) Regardless of the number of points an application receives in accordance with § 1703.126, the Administrator may, based on a review of the applications in accordance with the requirements of this subpart:

(1) Limit the number of applications selected for projects located in any one State during a fiscal year;

(2) Limit the number of selected applications for a particular project;

(3) Select an application receiving fewer points than another higher scoring application if there are insufficient funds during a particular funding period to select the higher scoring application. In this case, however, the Administrator will provide the applicant of the higher scoring application the opportunity to reduce the amount of its grant request to the amount of funds available. If the applicant agrees to lower its grant request, it must certify that the purposes of the project can be met, and the Administrator must determine the project is financially feasible at the lower amount in accordance with § 1703.125(e)(1). An applicant or multiple applicants affected under this paragraph will have the opportunity to be considered for loan financing in accordance with subparts F and G of this part.

(c) RUS will not approve a grant if RUS determines that:

(1) The applicant's proposal does not indicate financial feasibility or is not sustainable in accordance with the requirements of § 1703.125(e)(1);

(2) The applicant's proposal indicates technical flaws, which, in the opinion of RUS, would prevent successful implementation, operation, or sustainability of the project;

(3) Other applications would provide more benefit to rural America based on a review of the financial and technical information submitted in accordance with § 1703.125(e).

(4) Any other aspect of the applicant's proposal fails to adequately address any requirement of this subpart or contains inadequacies which would, in the opinion of RUS, undermine the ability of the project to meet the general purpose of this subpart or comply with policies of the DLT Program contained in § 1703.101.

(d) Grant applications will be ranked by the type of application (health care or educational) and total points scored. Grants available for medical and educational applicants may be allocated based on the total number of medical and educational applications scoring in the top 50 percent of all applications received for that fiscal year. Based on the number and type of applications received, applications may be ranked only in one category based on the predominant use of the project.

(e) RUS may reduce the amount of the applicant's grant based on insufficient program funding for the fiscal year in which the project is reviewed. RUS will discuss its findings informally with the applicant and make every effort to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with the applicant. Any discussions with the applicant and agreements made with regard to a reduced grant amount will be confirmed in writing, and these actions shall be deemed to have met the notification requirements set forth in paragraph (f) of this section.

(f) RUS will provide the applicant with an explanation of any determinations made with regard to paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section prior to making final project selections for the year. The applicant will be provided 15 days from the date of RUS' letter to respond, provide clarification, or make any adjustments or corrections to the project. If, in the opinion of the Administrator, the applicant fails to adequately respond to any determinations or other findings made by the Administrator, the project will not be funded, and the applicant will be notified of this determination. If the applicant does not agree with this finding an appeal may be filed in accordance with § 1703.129.

(g) Grantees shall comply with all applicable provisions of 2 CFR part 200, as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400.
