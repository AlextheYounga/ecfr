Refer to RD Instruction 1980-E, Appendix G, Liquidation and Property Management Guide (available in any Rural Development office) for advice on how to interact with the lender on liquidations and property management.

A. Protective advances will not be made in lieu of additional loans, in particular, working capital loans. Protective advances are advances made by the lender for the purpose of preserving and protecting the collateral where the debtor has failed to and will not or cannot meet its obligations. Ordinarily, protective advances are made when liquidation is contemplated or in process. A precise rule of when a protective advance should be made is impossible to state. A common, but by no means the only, period when protective advances might be needed is during liquidation. At this point, the borrower and success of the project are no longer of paramount importance, but preserving collateral for maximum recovery is of vital importance. Elements which should always be considered include how close the project is to liquidation or default, how much control the borrower will have over the funds, what danger is there that collateral may be destroyed and whether there will be a good chance of saving the collateral later if a protective advance in contemplation of liquidation is made immediately. A protective advance *must* be an indebtedness of the borrower.

B. The State Director must approve, in writing, all protective advances on loans within his/her loan approval authority which exceed a total commulative advance of $500 to the same borrower. Protective advances must be reasonable when associated with the value of collateral being preserved.

C. When considering protective advances, sound judgment must be exercised in determining that the additional funds advanced will actually preserve collateral interests and recovery is actually enhanced by making the advance.
