(b) The provisions in this part are applicable to eligible producers and eligible crops for which catastrophic coverage under section 508(b) or additional coverage of sections 508(c) or 508(h) under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1508) (excluding pilot policies or plans of insurance) is not available.

(c) The regulations in this part are applicable to the 2015 and subsequent crop years.
