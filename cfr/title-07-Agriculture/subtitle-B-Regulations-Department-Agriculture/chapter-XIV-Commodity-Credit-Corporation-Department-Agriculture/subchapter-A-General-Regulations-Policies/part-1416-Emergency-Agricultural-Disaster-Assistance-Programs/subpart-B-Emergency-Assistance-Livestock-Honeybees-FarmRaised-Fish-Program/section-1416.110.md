##### § 1416.110 Livestock payment calculations. #####

(a) Livestock feed payments for an eligible livestock producer will be calculated based on losses for no more than 150 days during the program year. Payment calculations for feed losses will be based on a national payment rate, as specified in § 1416.109, multiplied by the producer's actual cost for:

(1) Livestock feed that was purchased forage or feedstuffs intended for use as feed for the participant's eligible livestock that was physically damaged or destroyed due to the direct result of an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as specified in § 1416.103(d)(1);

(2) Livestock feed that was mechanically harvested forage or feedstuffs intended for use as feed for the participant's eligible livestock that was physically damaged or destroyed after harvest due to the direct result of an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as specified in § 1416.103(d)(2);

(3) The additional cost of purchasing additional livestock feed above normal quantities, required to maintain the eligible livestock during an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition until additional livestock feed becomes available, as specified in § 1416.103(d)(3); and

(4) The additional cost incurred for transporting livestock feed to eligible livestock due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, as specified in § 1416.103(d)(4);

(b) Payments for losses resulting from the additional cost of transporting water to eligible livestock due to an eligible drought for no more 150 days during the program year, as specified in § 1416.103(d)(5) calculated based on a national payment rate, as determined in § 1416.109, multiplied by the lesser of either:

(1) The total value of the cost to transport water to eligible livestock for 150 days, based on the daily water requirements for the eligible livestock, or

(2) The total value of the cost to transport water to eligible livestock for the program year, based on the actual number of gallons of water the eligible producer transported to eligible livestock for the program year.

(c) The total value of the cost to transport water to eligible livestock for 150 days to be used in the calculation for paragraph (b)(1) of this section is equal to the product obtained by multiplying:

(1) The number of eligible livestock converted to an animal unit basis;

(2) The gallons of water required per animal unit for maintenance for one day, as determined by the Deputy Administrator;

(3) The national average price per gallon to transport water and any appropriate regional or local adjustments as recommended by the STC and determined by the Deputy Administrator; and

(4) 150 days.

(d) The total value of the cost to transport water to eligible livestock for the program year to be used in the calculation for paragraph (b)(2) of this section is equal to the product obtained by multiplying:

(1) Actual number of gallons of water transported by the eligible producer to eligible livestock in the program year; and

(2) The national average price per gallon to transport water and any appropriate regional or local adjustments as recommended by the STC and determined by the Deputy Administrator.

(e) The national average price per gallon to transport water to be used in the calculation for paragraphs (c)(3) and (d)(2) of this section is $0.04, or such other price determined by the Deputy Administrator.

(f) Payments for an eligible livestock producer, for livestock losses resulting from the additional cost associated with gathering livestock to treat for cattle tick fever will be calculated for the actual number of livestock involved in each treatment. Total payments are equal to the sum of the following for each treatment:

(1) The national payment rate, as determined in § 1416.109, times

(2) The number of eligible livestock treated by APHIS for cattle tick fever, times

(3) The average cost to gather livestock, per head, as established by the Deputy Administrator.

(g) Payments for an eligible livestock producer for grazing losses, except for losses due to wildfires on non-Federal land, will be calculated based on the applicable national payment rate, as determined in § 1416.109, multiplied by the lesser of:

(1) The total value of the feed cost for all covered livestock owned by the eligible livestock producer based on the number of days grazing was lost, not to exceed 150 days of daily feed cost for all eligible livestock, or

(2) The total value of grazing lost for all eligible livestock based on the normal carrying capacity, as determined by the Secretary, of the eligible grazing land of the eligible livestock producer for the number of grazing days lost, not to exceed 150 days of lost grazing.

(h) The total value of feed cost to be used in the calculation for paragraph (g)(1) of this section is based on the number of days grazing was lost and equals the product obtained by multiplying:

(1) A payment quantity equal to the feed grain equivalent, as determined in paragraph (i) of this section;

(2) A payment rate equal to the corn price per pound, as determined in paragraph (j) of this section;

(3) The number of all eligible livestock owned by the eligible producer converted to an animal unit basis;

(4) The number of days grazing was lost, not to exceed 150 calendar days during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land; and

(5) The producer's ownership share in the livestock.

(i) The feed grain equivalent to be used in the calculation for paragraph (g)(1) of this section equals, in the case of:

(1) An adult beef cow, 15.7 pounds of corn per day, or

(2) Any other type or weight of livestock, an amount determined by the Secretary that represents the average number of pounds of corn per day necessary to feed that specific type of livestock.

(j) The corn price per pound to be used in the calculation for paragraph (h)(2) of this section equals the quotient calculated as follows:

(1) The higher of:

(i) The national average corn price per bushel of corn for the 12-month period immediately preceding March 1 of the program year for which payments are calculated; or

(ii) The national average corn price per bushel of corn for the 24-month period immediately preceding March 1 of the program year for which payments are calculated;

(2) Divided by 56.

(k) The total value of grazing lost to be used in the calculation for paragraph (h)(2) of this section equals the product obtained by multiplying:

(1) A payment quantity equal to the feed grain equivalent of 15.7 pounds of corn per day;

(2) A payment rate equal to the corn price per pound, as determined in paragraph (j) of this section;

(3) The number of animal units the eligible livestock producer's grazing land or pastureland can sustain during the normal grazing period in the county for the specific type of grazing land or pastureland, in the absence of an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, determined by dividing the:

(i) Number of eligible grazing land or pastureland acres of the specific type of grazing land or pastureland, by

(ii) The normal carrying capacity of the specific type of eligible grazing land or pastureland; and

(4) The number of days grazing was lost, not to exceed 150 calendar days during the normal grazing period for the specific type of grazing land.

(l) Payments for an eligible livestock producer for grazing losses due to a wildfire on non-Federal land will be calculated based on the applicable national payment rate, as determined in § 1416.109, multiplied by:

(1) The result of dividing:

(i) The number of acres of grazing land or pastureland acres affected by the fire, by

(ii) The normal carrying capacity of the specific type of eligible grazing land or pastureland; times

(3) The number of days grazing was lost due to fire, not to exceed 180 calendar days;

(m) If a participant, during the normal grazing period for the eligible grazing land, claims both an eligible loss resulting from the additional cost of purchasing additional livestock feed above normal quantities, as calculated in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, and an eligible grazing loss, as calculated in paragraphs (g) or (l) of this section, then the participant may receive no more than the larger of the value of the loss resulting from the:

(1) Additional cost of purchasing additional livestock feed, as calculated in paragraph (a)(3) of this section; or

(2) Grazing loss, as determined in:

(i) Paragraph (g) of this section, for losses due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition, except wildfires on non-Federal lands, or

(ii) Paragraph (l) of this section, for losses due to wildfires on non-Federal lands.

(n) Payments for an eligible livestock producer for eligible livestock death losses will be based on the applicable national payment rate, as determined in § 1416.109, multiplied by the result in paragraph (n)(1) of this section.

(1) Payments will be calculated by multiplying:

(i) The livestock payment rate for each livestock category, times

(ii) The number of eligible livestock that died in each category as a result of an eligible loss condition in excess of normal mortality, as determined in paragraph (n)(2) of this section;

(2) Normal mortality for each livestock category as determined by FSA on a statewide basis using local data sources including, but not limited to, State livestock organizations and the Cooperative Extension Service for the State.

(3) The livestock payment rates to be used in the calculation for paragraph (n)(1) of this section for eligible livestock owners and eligible livestock contract growers are:

(i) A livestock payment rate for eligible livestock owners that is based on the average fair market value of the applicable livestock as computed using nationwide prices for the previous program year unless some other price is approved by the Deputy Administrator.
