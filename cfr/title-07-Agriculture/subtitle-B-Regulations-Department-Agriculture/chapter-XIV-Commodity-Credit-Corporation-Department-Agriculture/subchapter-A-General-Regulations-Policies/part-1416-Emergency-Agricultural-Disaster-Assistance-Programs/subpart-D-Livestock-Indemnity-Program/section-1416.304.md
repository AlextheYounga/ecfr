(f) The following livestock are considered to be ineligible livestock for the purpose of generating payments under this subpart:

(1) Livestock that have died due to disease where the disease was not exacerbated by an eligible adverse weather event. Diseases that can be prevented by implementing and following acceptable management practices, such as vaccination, are not considered an eligible livestock death loss under LIP. Livestock that die as a result of the disease are not eligible for payment to be generated under LIP when the disease has been determined to not have been exacerbated by an eligible adverse weather event and vaccination or acceptable management practices can or have been implemented to prevent such disease. Before COC approves LIP applications for payment for disease, COC through STC, must request determination from the Deputy Administrator or designee whether the specific disease is a disease that is exacerbated by an eligible adverse weather event.
