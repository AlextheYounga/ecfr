##### § 1416.305 Application process. #####

(a) Notices of loss and applications for payment that had been filed under the regulations in effect at the time of filing and which had been issued an administrative decision for either a 2017 or 2018 program year loss are not eligible for consideration under paragraph (b) of this section, unless the administrative decision was based only on a failure to submit the notice of loss or application for payment by the prior applicable deadline. In that instance, the owner or contract grower must file a notice under paragraph (b) to receive a new decision.

(b) A livestock owner or contract grower that suffered livestock losses must:

(1) For 2017 and subsequent program years, provide a notice of loss, by livestock unit, to FSA by the later of 30 calendar days of when the loss of livestock is first apparent to the livestock owner or contract grower or December 3, 2018.

(2) Submit the notice of loss required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the FSA county office responsible for servicing the physical location county where the loss occurred.

(c) In addition to the notice of loss required in paragraph (b) of this section, a participant must also submit a completed application for payment, by livestock unit:

(1) For losses apparent in 2017, by December 3, 2018.

(2) For losses apparent in 2018 and subsequent years, by no later than 60 calendar days after the end of the calendar year in which the eligible loss condition occurred.

(d) A participant must provide other supporting documents required for determining eligibility as an applicant at the time the participant submits the completed application for payment. Supporting documents must include:

(1) Evidence of loss,

(2) Current physical location of livestock in inventory,

(3) Physical location of claimed livestock at the time of death or injury,

(4) Inventory numbers for the livestock unit and other inventory information necessary to establish actual mortality as required by FSA,

(5) A farm operating plan, if a current farm operating plan is not already on file in the FSA county office,

(6) Documentation of the adverse weather event from an official weather reporting data source that is determined by FSA to be reputable and available in the public domain such as, but not limited to, NOAA, from which State and County FSA Offices can validate the adverse weather event occurred,

(7) Documentation to substantiate eligible attacks obtained from a source such as, but not limited to, the following:

(i) APHIS,

(ii) State level Department of Natural Resources, or

(iii) Other sources or documentation, such as third parties, as determined by the Deputy Administrator, and

(8) If livestock are injured and sold at a reduced price.

(i) Documentation of injured livestock's gross price, and

(ii) Documentation to substantiate injury of livestock due to an eligible adverse weather event or eligible attack.

(9) The livestock producer may supplement additional documentation to support the eligible loss condition, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

(10) In addition, contract growers must provide a copy of the grower contract.

(e) For death losses or losses resulting from injured livestock sold at a reduced price, the participant must provide adequate proof that the death or injury of the eligible livestock occurred as a direct result of an eligible loss condition, as opposed to any other possible or potential cause of loss. The quantity and kind of livestock that died as a direct result of the eligible loss condition may be documented by: Purchase records; veterinarian records; bank or other loan papers; rendering-plant truck receipts; Federal Emergency Management Agency records; National Guard records; written contracts; production records; Internal Revenue Service records; property tax records; private insurance documents; and other similar verifiable documents as determined by FSA. The quantity and kind of livestock that died or has been injured and sold at a reduced price as a direct result of an eligible attack must be substantiated by documentation of confirmed kills observed by an acceptable source as specified in paragraphs (d)(7) and (g) of this section.

(f) If adequate verifiable proof of death or injury documentation is not available, the participant may provide reliable records, in conjunction with verifiable beginning and ending inventory records, as proof of death or injury. Reliable records may include contemporaneous producer records, dairy herd improvement records, brand inspection records, vaccination records, dated pictures, and other similar reliable documents as determined by FSA.

(g) For 2018 and subsequent calendar years, for livestock death losses due to disease, a licensed veterinarian's certification of livestock deaths may be accepted as verifiable proof of death, if reliable beginning inventory data is available, only if the veterinarian provides a written statement containing all of the following:

(1) Veterinarian's personal observation of the animals and knowledge of how the deaths of the livestock were because of disease caused or exacerbated by an eligible adverse weather event;

(2) Livestock deaths were not otherwise avoidable and preventable using good animal husbandry and management protocols and practices by the livestock producer; and

(v) Data furnished by the participant and the third party will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, without all required data program benefits will not be approved or provided.
.

(i) Calf and lamb open range livestock operations may provide proof of death by using the livestock beginning inventory history for reporting losses.

(1) For 2017 and subsequent calendar years, livestock inventory reports by livestock unit must be provided to the local county FSA office by the later of December 3, 2018 or 60 calendar days after the end of the calendar year of the eligible adverse weather event. The STC may approve a waiver of the reporting deadline if a participant has not previously received benefits under this method.

(i) Livestock inventory reports must provide an accurate account of livestock beginning inventory for the open range livestock type or kind and must be supported by written verifiable records such as but not limited to: Docking records, sales receipts, shearing records, shipping records, bank records, veterinarian records, IRS records, or other records approved by COC. For purposes of determining beginning livestock inventory, livestock inventory reports may require adjustment by COC, not to exceed normal mortality, for when loss occurs at different points during the growing season (for example, inventories from docking may need little to no adjustment, but sales records at the end of the growing season may require an adjustment to account for a full years of normal mortality).

(ii) The open range livestock operation must certify to the accuracy of the information.

(2) The open range livestock operation is solely responsible for the timely submission and certification of accurate, complete livestock beginning inventory to the county FSA office. Livestock beginning inventory records must be provided for all livestock type or kind.

(i) Records may be requested by the applicable COC or STC, on behalf of FSA. The open range livestock operation must provide such records upon request.

(ii) The COC will explain the procedure for the livestock beginning inventory history to open range livestock operation. COC will determine the livestock beginning inventory history in accordance with § 1416.305(g).

(iii) COC will determine if the livestock beginning inventory records are acceptable and calculate the approved livestock beginning inventory history.

(3) The livestock beginning inventory history is calculated utilizing a minimum of 4 years of data and will be updated each subsequent inventory year. The transitional livestock beginning inventory history may contain a maximum of the 4 most recent calendar years and may include actual and transitional livestock beginning inventories. Transitional livestock beginning inventory history will only be used when less than 4 years of actual records are available. Appropriate adjustments to livestock beginning inventory history may be made to account for variations in ewe and cow stocking levels during the period covered by the history.

(4) The open range livestock operation is required to provide beginning livestock inventory records to determine the livestock beginning inventory history, if livestock beginning inventory records are available.

(i) If no acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are available for either calves or lambs, calculate the 4 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 65 percent.

(ii) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only one of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the 3 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 80 percent.

(iii) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only 2 of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the 2 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 90 percent.

(iv) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only 3 of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the one transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 100 percent.

(v) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory history records containing information for 4 or more of the most recent calendar years are provided, calculate the livestock beginning inventory history by taking a simple average of the actual livestock beginning inventory histories.

(j) When an eligible owner claims eligible livestock were injured by an eligible loss condition and were sold for a reduced price, the owner must provide verifiable evidence of the gross sale price of the livestock. The injured livestock must be sold through an independent third party (sale barn, slaughter facility, or rendering facility). Only verifiable proof of sale with price is acceptable. The gross sale price of the livestock is the amount received for the injured livestock before any reductions, such as sale yard fees. The owner must provide verifiable evidence of livestock sold at a reduced price. Documents that may satisfy this requirement include but are not limited to, any or a combination of the following: Sales receipt from a livestock auction, sale barn, or other similar livestock sales facility; bona-fide commercial sales receipts; private insurance documents; and processing plant receipts.

(k) For livestock death losses that occurred on or after October 1, 2011, and before January 1, 2015, livestock producers who cannot meet the criteria in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section may provide acceptable documentation of proof of death and inventories according to the requirements in this paragraph (h).

(1) Documents that may provide acceptable evidence of death include, but are not limited to, any or a combination of the following:

(i) Contemporaneous producer records existing at the time of the event, such as, but not limited to: Personal diary listing births, deaths, unaccounted animals, and date of such event; personal diary of cowboy or herdsman showing animal care; calendar listing births, deaths, unaccounted animals, date livestock turned out on pasture; pictures with a date; brand inspection records; dairy herd improvement records; ear tag documentation or records; and other similar reliable documents. COC may require the livestock producer to file a third-party certification to support the contemporaneous records.

(ii) Third-party certification according to paragraph (f) of this section, except that the third-party is not required to certify to the specific number of livestock.

(2) Documents that may provide acceptable evidence of livestock inventory include, but are not limited to, any or a combination of the following:

(i) Veterinary records;

(ii) Canceled check documentation;

(iii) Balance sheets;

(iv) Inventory records used for tax purposes;

(v) Loan records;

(vi) Bank statements;

(vii) Farm credit balance sheets;

(viii) Property tax records;

(xix) Trucking and/or livestock hauling records;

(x) Brand inspection records;

(xi) Sales and purchase receipts;

(xii) Private insurance documents;

(xiii) Chattel inspections;

(xiv) IRS records such schedule F and depreciation schedules;

(xv) Docking records;

(xvi) Shearing records;

(xvii) Ear tag records.

(3) COC may compare livestock numbers and carrying capacity to acreage reports filed by a producer during the calendar year of loss to determine reasonableness.

(4) COC must review all documentation provided by the producer and based upon review of the documentation provided by the producer and personal knowledge of the producer's livestock operation, determine whether the number of death losses reported by the livestock producer are reasonable and whether the application for payment should be approved.
