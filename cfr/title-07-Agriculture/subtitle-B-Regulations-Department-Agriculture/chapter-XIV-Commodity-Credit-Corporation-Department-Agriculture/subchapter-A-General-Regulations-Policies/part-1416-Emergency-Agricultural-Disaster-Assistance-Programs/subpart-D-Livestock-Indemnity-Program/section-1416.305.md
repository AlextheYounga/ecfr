(8) The livestock producer may supplement additional documentation to support eligible adverse weather events and eligible attacks by animal or avian predators, as determined by the Deputy Administrator.

(d) The participant must provide adequate proof that the death of the eligible livestock occurred as a direct result of an eligible adverse weather event or attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the Federal Government or protected by Federal law, including wolves and avian predators, in the calendar year for which benefits are requested. The quantity and kind of livestock that died as a direct result of the eligible adverse weather event during the calendar year for which benefits are being requested may be documented by: Purchase records; veterinarian records; bank or other loan papers; rendering-plant truck receipts; Federal Emergency Management Agency records; National Guard records; written contracts; production records; Internal Revenue Service records; property tax records; private insurance documents; and other similar verifiable documents as determined by FSA.

(e) If adequate verifiable proof of death documentation is not available, the participant may provide reliable records, in conjunction with verifiable beginning and ending inventory records, as proof of death. Reliable records may include contemporaneous producer records, dairy herd improvement records, brand inspection records, vaccination records, dated pictures, and other similar reliable documents as determined by FSA.

(f) Certification of livestock deaths by third parties may be accepted if verifiable beginning and ending inventory data is available only if verifiable proof of death records or reliable proof of death records in conjunction with verifiable beginning and ending inventory records are not available and both of the following conditions are met:

(1) The livestock owner or livestock contract grower, as applicable, certifies in writing:

(i) That there is no other verifiable or reliable documentation of death available;

(ii) The number of livestock, by category identified in this subpart and by FSA were in inventory at the time the eligible adverse weather event occurred;

(iii) The physical location of the livestock, by category, in inventory when the deaths occurred; and

(iv) Other details required for FSA to determine the certification acceptable; and

(2) The third party is an independent source who is not affiliated with the farming operation such as a hired hand and is not a “family member,” defined as a person whom a member in the farming operation or their spouse is related as lineal ancestor, lineal descendant, sibling, spouse, and provides their telephone number, address, and a written statement containing specific details about:

(i) Their knowledge of the livestock deaths;

(ii) Their affiliation with the livestock owner;

(iii) The accuracy of the deaths claimed by the livestock owner or contract grower including, but not limited to, the number and kind or type of the participant's livestock that died because of the eligible adverse weather event; and

(iv) Other information required by FSA to determine the certification acceptable.

(v) Data furnished by the participant and the third party will be used to determine eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary; however, without all required data program benefits will not be approved or provided.

(g) Calf and lamb open range livestock operations may provide proof of death by using the livestock beginning inventory history for reporting losses.

(1) For 2015 and subsequent calendar years, livestock inventory reports must be provided to the local county FSA office no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the calendar year for which reports will be accepted for inclusion in the base period for the current calendar year. For the 2011 through 2014 calendar years, producers have until January 30, 2015, to provide the applicable livestock inventory reports. The STC may approve a waiver of the reporting deadline if a participant has not previously received benefits under this method.

(i) Livestock inventory reports must provide an accurate account of livestock beginning inventory for the open range livestock type or kind and must be supported by written verifiable records such as but not limited to: Docking records, sales receipts, shearing records, shipping records, bank records, veterinarian records, IRS records, or other records approved by COC. For purposes of determining beginning livestock inventory, livestock inventory reports may require adjustment by COC, not to exceed normal mortality, for when loss occurs at different points during the growing season (for example, inventories from docking may need little to no adjustment, but sales records at the end of the growing season may require an adjustment to account for a full years of normal mortality).

(ii) The open range livestock operation must certify to the accuracy of the information.

(2) The open range livestock operation is solely responsible for the timely submission and certification of accurate, complete livestock beginning inventory to the county FSA office. Livestock beginning inventory records must be provided for all livestock type or kind.

(i) Records may be requested by the applicable COC or STC, on behalf of FSA. The open range livestock operation must provide such records upon request.

(ii) The COC will explain the procedure for the livestock beginning inventory history to open range livestock operation. COC will determine the livestock beginning inventory history in accordance with § 1416.305(g).

(iii) COC will determine if the livestock beginning inventory records are acceptable and calculate the approved livestock beginning inventory history.

(3) The livestock beginning inventory history is calculated utilizing a minimum of 4 years of data and will be updated each subsequent inventory year. The transitional livestock beginning inventory history may contain a maximum of the 4 most recent calendar years and may include actual and transitional livestock beginning inventories. Transitional livestock beginning inventory history will only be used when less than 4 years of actual records are available. Appropriate adjustments to livestock beginning inventory history may be made to account for variations in ewe and cow stocking levels during the period covered by the history.

(4) The open range livestock operation is required to provide beginning livestock inventory records to determine the livestock beginning inventory history, if livestock beginning inventory records are available.

(i) If no acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are available for either calves or lambs, calculate the 4 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 65 percent.

(ii) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only one of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the 3 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 80 percent.

(iii) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only 2 of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the 2 transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 90 percent.

(iv) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory records are provided for only 3 of the most recent 5 calendar years, calculate the one transitional livestock beginning inventory histories by multiplying the approved birthing rate or drop rate percentage for the open range livestock operation times the applicable cow or ewe livestock beginning inventory history times 100 percent.

(v) If acceptable livestock beginning inventory history records containing information for 4 or more of the most recent calendar years are provided, calculate the livestock beginning inventory history by taking a simple average of the actual livestock beginning inventory histories.

(h) For livestock death losses that occurred on or after October 1, 2011, and before January 1, 2015, livestock producers who cannot meet the criteria in paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section may provide acceptable documentation of proof of death and inventories according to the requirements in this paragraph (h).

(1) Documents that may provide acceptable evidence of death include, but are not limited to, any or a combination of the following:

(i) Contemporaneous producer records existing at the time of the event, such as, but not limited to: Personal diary listing births, deaths, unaccounted animals, and date of such event; personal diary of cowboy or herdsman showing animal care; calendar listing births, deaths, unaccounted animals, date livestock turned out on pasture; pictures with a date; brand inspection records; dairy herd improvement records; ear tag documentation or records; and other similar reliable documents. COC may require the livestock producer to file a third-party certification to support the contemporaneous records.

(ii) Third-party certification according to paragraph (f) of this section, except that the third-party is not required to certify to the specific number of livestock.

(2) Documents that may provide acceptable evidence of livestock inventory include, but are not limited to, any or a combination of the following:

(i) Veterinary records;

(ii) Canceled check documentation;

(iii) Balance sheets;

(iv) Inventory records used for tax purposes;

(v) Loan records;

(vi) Bank statements;

(vii) Farm credit balance sheets;

(viii) Property tax records;

(xix) Trucking and/or livestock hauling records;

(x) Brand inspection records;

(xi) Sales and purchase receipts;

(xii) Private insurance documents;

(xiii) Chattel inspections;

(xiv) IRS records such schedule F and depreciation schedules;

(xv) Docking records;

(xvi) Shearing records;

(xvii) Ear tag records.

(3) COC may compare livestock numbers and carrying capacity to acreage reports filed by a producer during the calendar year of loss to determine reasonableness.

(4) COC must review all documentation provided by the producer and based upon review of the documentation provided by the producer and personal knowledge of the producer's livestock operation, determine whether the number of death losses reported by the livestock producer are reasonable and whether the application for payment should be approved.
