##### ยง 1416.6 Payment eligibility and limitation. #####

(a) For 2017 and subsequent program years, a person or legal entity, excluding a joint venture or general partnership, as determined in part 1400 of this chapter, must not receive ELAP and LFP payments combined, directly or indirectly, in excess of $125,000 per program year.

(b) The Deputy Administrator may take such actions as needed to avoid a duplication of benefits under the programs provided for in this part, or duplication of benefits received in other programs, and may impose such cross-program payment limitations as may be consistent with the intent of this part in order to help prevent a person or legal entity being paid more than the total value of their loss.

(c) For losses incurred beginning on October 1, 2011, and for the purposes of administering LIP, LFP, ELAP, and TAP, the average adjusted gross income (AGI) limitation provisions in part 1400 of this chapter relating to limits on payments for persons or legal entities, excluding joint ventures and general partnerships, apply under this subpart and will apply to each applicant for ELAP, LFP, LIP, and TAP. Specifically, a person or legal entity with an average AGI that exceeds $900,000 will not be eligible to receive benefits under this part.

(d) The direct attribution provisions in part 1400 of this chapter apply to ELAP, LFP, LIP, and TAP.
