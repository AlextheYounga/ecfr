##### ยง 1416.6 Payment limitation. #####

(a) For 2011, no person or legal entity, excluding a joint venture or general partnership, as determined according to the rules in part 1400 of this chapter may receive more than:

(1) $125,000 total in 2011 program year payments under LFP, SURE, ELAP, and LIP combined when at least $25,000 of such total 2011 program year payments is from LFP or LIP for losses from October 1 through December 31, 2011. If no 2011 program year payments are issued under LFP or LIP for losses occurring from October 1, 2011, through December 31, 2011, the total amount of 2011 program year payments under LFP, SURE, ELAP, and LIP combined is limited to $100,000.

(2) $125,000 for the 2011 program year under TAP.

(b) For 2012 and subsequent program years, no person or legal entity, excluding a joint venture or general partnership, as determined by the rules in part 1400 of this chapter may receive, directly or indirectly, more than:

(1) $125,000 per program year total under ELAP, LFP, and LIP combined; or

(2) $125,000 per program year under TAP.

(c) The Deputy Administrator may take such actions as needed to avoid a duplication of benefits under the programs provided for in this part, or duplication of benefits received in other programs, and may impose such cross-program payment limitations as may be consistent with the intent of this part.

(d) Beginning with the 2014 program year, if a producer is eligible to receive benefits under this part is also eligible to receive assistance for the same loss under any other program, including, but not limited to, indemnities made under the Federal Crop Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1501-1524) or the noninsured crop disaster assistance program (7 U.S.C. 7333), then the producer must elect whether to receive benefits under this part or under the other program, but not both.

(e) For losses incurred beginning on October 1, 2011, and for the purposes of administering LIP, LFP, ELAP, and TAP, the average adjusted gross income (AGI) limitation provisions in part 1400 of this chapter relating to limits on payments for persons or legal entities, excluding joint ventures and general partnerships, with certain levels of AGI will apply under this subpart and will apply to each applicant for ELAP, LFP, LIP, and TAP. Specifically, a person or legal entity with an average AGI that exceeds $900,000 will not be eligible to receive benefits under this part.

(f) The direct attribution provisions in part 1400 of this chapter apply to ELAP, LFP, LIP, and TAP. Under those rules, any payment to any legal entity will also be considered for payment limitation purposes to be a payment to persons or legal entities with an interest in the legal entity or in a sub-entity. If any such interested person or legal entity is over the payment limitation because of payment made directly or indirectly or a combination thereof, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurate with the amount of the interest of the interested person in the payee. Likewise, by the same method, if anyone with a direct or indirect interest in a legal entity or sub-entity of a payee entity exceeds the AGI levels that would allow a participant to directly receive a payment under this part, then the payment to the actual payee will be reduced commensurately with that interest. For all purposes under this section, unless otherwise specified in part 1400 of this chapter, the AGI figure that will be relevant for a person or legal entity will be an average AGI for the three taxable years that precede the most immediately preceding complete taxable year, as determined by FSA.
