##### ยง 1466.20 Application for contracts and selecting applications. #####

(a) In evaluating EQIP applications, NRCS, with advice from the State Technical Committee, Tribal Conservation Advisory Council, or local working group takes into account the following guidelines:

(1) Any producer who has eligible land may submit an application for participation in EQIP. Applications may be accepted on a continuous basis throughout the year. Producers who are members of a joint operation may file a single application for ranking purposes for the joint operation.

(2) NRCS, to the greatest extent practicable, will group applications of similar crop, forestry, and livestock operations for evaluation purposes.

(b) In selecting EQIP applications, NRCS, with advice from the State Technical Committee, Tribal Conservation Advisory Council, or local working group, may establish ranking pools to address a specific resource concern, geographic area, or agricultural operation type or develop an evaluation process to prioritize and rank applications for funding that address national, State, and local priority resource concerns, taking into account the following guidelines:

(1) NRCS will select applications for funding based on applicant eligibility, fund availability, and the NRCS evaluation process. NRCS will rank applications according to the following factors related to conservation benefits to address identified resource concerns through implementation of conservation practices:

(i) The degree of cost-effectiveness of the proposed conservation practices,

(ii) The magnitude of the expected conservation benefits resulting from the conservation treatment and the priority of the resource concerns that have been identified at the local, State, and national levels,

(iii) How effectively and comprehensively the project addresses the designated resource concern or resource concerns,

(iv) Use of conservation practices that provide long-term conservation enhancements,

(v) Compliance with Federal, State, Tribal, or local regulatory requirements concerning soil, water, and air quality; wildlife habitat; and ground and surface water conservation,

(vi) Willingness of the applicant to complete all conservation practices in an expedited manner,

(vii) The ability to improve existing conservation practices or systems which are in place at the time the application is accepted, or that complete a conservation system, and

(viii) Other locally defined pertinent factors, such as the location of the conservation practice, the extent of natural resource degradation, and the degree of cooperation by local producers to achieve environmental improvements.

(2) For applications that include water conservation or irrigation-related practices, and consistent with State law in which the applicant's eligible land is located, NRCS may give priority to those applications that:

(i) Result in a reduction in water use in the agricultural operation, or

(ii) Include an agreement by the applicant not to use any associated water savings to bring new land (other than incidental land needed for efficient operations) under irrigation production unless the producer is participating in a watershed-wide project that will effectively conserve water. NRCS may designate eligible watershed-wide projects that effectively conserve water, using the following criteria:

(A) The project area has a current, comprehensive water resource assessment,

(B) The project plan has demonstrated effective water conservation management strategies, and

(C) The project sponsors have consulted relevant State and local agencies.

(3) If NRCS determines that the conservation benefits of two or more applications for payments are comparable, NRCS may not assign a higher priority to the application solely because it would present the least cost to the program.

(4) The ranking score may not give preferential treatment to applications based on size of the operation, income generated from the operation, type of operation, or other factors not related to conservation benefits to address a resource concern unless authorized in this rule.

(5) The evaluation process will determine the order in which applications will be selected for funding. To improve administrative efficiency, NRCS may use screening factors as part of its evaluation process that may include sorting applications into high, medium, or low priority. If screening factors are used to designate a higher priority for ranking, all eligible applications with a higher priority and that address an eligible resource concern are ranked and considered for funding before ranking or considering for funding applications that are a lower priority. The approving authority for EQIP contracts will be NRCS.

(6) NRCS will make available to the public all information regarding priority resource concerns, the list of eligible practices, payment rates, and how EQIP is implemented in a State.
