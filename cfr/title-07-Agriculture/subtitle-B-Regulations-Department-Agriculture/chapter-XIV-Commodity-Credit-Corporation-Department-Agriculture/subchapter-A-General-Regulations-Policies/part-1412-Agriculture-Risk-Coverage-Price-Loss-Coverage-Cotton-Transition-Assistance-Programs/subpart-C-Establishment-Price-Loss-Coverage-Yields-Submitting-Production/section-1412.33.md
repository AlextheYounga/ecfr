##### ยง 1412.33 Updating PLC yield for seed cotton. #####

(a) For a farm that has seed cotton base acres as adjusted, in excess of zero acres, a current owner of the farm has a one-time opportunity in a specified period, as announced by FSA, to update the PLC yield equal to 90 percent of the upland cotton's 2008 through 2012 average yield per planted acre, excluding from the average any year that no acreage was planted to upland cotton, times 2.4. If the yield per planted acre in any of the years 2008 through 2012 is less than 75 percent of the average of the county yield, then 75 percent of the average of the 2008 through 2012 county yields will be substituted for that year.

(b) The current owner of the farm may retain the PLC yield or update the PLC yield.

(c) PLC yields are exclusively used for PLC. However, any owner of a farm can update the seed cotton PLC yield as specified in paragraph (a) of this section, regardless of program election, enrollment, or participation.

(d) A decision by any current owner of a farm to update the seed cotton PLC yield as specified in this section is final and binding unless that decision to update the yield is withdrawn by that current owner or a different yield update is made by that current owner or another current owner. If that current owner or another current owner requests a different PLC yield update for the covered commodity during the yield update period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, that update will become final.

(e) All PLC yield updates are subject to review and approval by FSA as specified in ยง 1412.36. FSA's decision to issue payments based on the PLC yield updated by an owner is subject to verification and spot check by FSA at any time.

(f) Yield updates in this section will be permitted using the current owner's certification of yield. The certification is subject to spot check or verification by FSA at any time. If selected for spot check or verification, the owner must submit evidence specified in ยง 1412.35 to support the certified yield.
