##### § 1412.2 Administration. #####

(a) ARC, PLC, and CTAP are administered under the general supervision of the Executive Vice-President, CCC, and will be carried out by FSA State and county committees (State and county committees).

(b) State and county committees, and representatives and their employees, do not have authority to modify or waive any of the provisions of the regulations of this part.

(c) The State committee may take any action required by the regulations of this part that the county committee has not taken. The State committee will also:

(1) Correct, or require a county committee to correct, any action taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with the regulations of this part; or

(2) Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is not in accordance with this part.

(d) No provision or delegation to a State or county committee will preclude the Executive Vice President, or the Deputy Administrator, or a designee, from determining any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying any determination made by a State or county committee.

(e) The Deputy Administrator has the authority to permit State and county committees to waive or modify deadlines (except deadlines specified in a law) and other requirements not specified by law, in cases where lateness or failure to meet such other requirements does not adversely affect operation of the program.

(1) Producers and participants have no right to a decision requesting an exception for a decision about waiving or modifying deadlines. The Deputy Administrator's refusal to consider waiver or modification cases or circumstances or a decision not to exercise this discretionary authority under this section will not be considered an adverse decision and is not appealable.

(2) CCC's decision not to consider a case under this section will not constitute a failure to act under any law or regulation because participants have no right to a waiver or modification under this section, they likewise have no right to a decision on a request for waiver or modification.

(f) A representative of CCC may execute the FSA application form titled “Cotton Transition Assistance Program (CTAP) Application” only under the terms and conditions determined and announced by the Executive Vice President, CCC. Any application or contract that is not executed in accordance with such terms and conditions, including any alleged execution prior to or after the dates authorized by the Executive Vice President, CCC, is null and void and will not be considered to be an application or contract between CCC and the operator or any other producer on the farm.
