##### § 1412.53 ARC payment provisions. #####

(a) Provided all provisions of this part including but not limited to ARC-CO election and enrollment have been satisfied for each of the 2014 through 2018 contract years, CCC will issue, as applicable and consistent with the election and enrollment:

(1) An ARC-CO payment beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for the covered commodity to the producers on a farm for a covered commodity in each crop year if the farm was enrolled in ARC-CO and the ARC-CO actual crop revenue was less than the ARC-CO guarantee.

(2) Payment is equal to the result of multiplying the payment acres for the covered commodity times the difference between the actual crop revenue and the ARC-CO guarantee, not to exceed 10 percent of the ARC-CO benchmark revenue.

(b) Provided all provisions of this part including but not limited to ARC-IC election and enrollment have been satisfied for each of the 2014 through 2018 contract years, CCC will issue, as applicable and consistent with the election and enrollment:

(1) An ARC-IC payment beginning October 1, or as soon as practicable thereafter, after the end of the applicable marketing year for the farm if the farm was enrolled in ARC-IC and the ARC-IC actual crop revenue for that farm is less than the ARC-IC guarantee.

(2) Payment is equal to the result of multiplying the payment acres for the covered commodities times the difference between actual crop revenue and the ARC-IC guarantee, not to exceed 10 percent of benchmark revenue for ARC-IC.

(c) If a producer has an interest in multiple farms that have enrolled in ARC-IC, the ARC-IC benchmark revenue for that producer used in the payment calculation will be a weighted average of the benchmark revenue for those multiple farms.

(d) In a county having a sufficient number of farms with P&CP acreage history of a covered commodity in 2009 through 2012, as determined by FSA, where at least an average of 25 percent of a covered commodity's P&CP acreage was irrigated in 2009 through 2012 and at least an average of 25 percent of the same covered commodity's P&CP acreage in that county was non-irrigated in 2009 through 2012, a separate irrigated and non-irrigated benchmark revenue, guarantee, and actual revenue will be maintained by FSA for the affected county. For farms in these counties with covered commodities enrolled in ARC-CO and ARC-IC, the average 2009 through 2012 reported acreage of each covered commodity on the farm with irrigated and non-irrigated status will be used to calculate a percentage of each applicable covered commodity that will be applied against the irrigated and non-irrigated benchmark revenue, guarantee, and actual revenue as determined by FSA.

(e) FSA will determine the irrigated and non-irrigated counties and crops prior to the 2014 enrollment period and that determination will be effective through the 2018 program year, unless there is a substantial change in the irrigated and non-irrigated practices in the county, as determined by the FSA.

(f) The effective price and guarantee for temperate japonica rice will be based on the price that all medium and short grain (including glutinous) rice receives in California. The effective price and guarantee for medium grain rice outside California will be based on the price that all medium and short grain rice receives outside California.
