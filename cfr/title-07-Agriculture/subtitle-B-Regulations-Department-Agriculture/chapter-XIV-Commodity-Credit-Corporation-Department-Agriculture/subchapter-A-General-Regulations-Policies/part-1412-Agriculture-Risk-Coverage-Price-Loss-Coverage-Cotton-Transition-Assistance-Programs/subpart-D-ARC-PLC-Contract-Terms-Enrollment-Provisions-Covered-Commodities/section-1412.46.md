##### ยง 1412.46 Planting flexibility. #####

(a) Any crop may be planted and harvested on base acres on a farm, except as limited in this section. Any crop may be planted on cropland in excess of the base acres on a farm.

(b) Base acres may be hayed or grazed at any time.

(c) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this section, the planting or harvesting of perennial or harvesting of non-perennial fruits, vegetables (except mung beans and covered commodities), or wild rice, as determined by CCC, will result in an acre for acre payment reduction when such crop or crops are planted and or harvested, as applicable, on more than:

(1) 15 percent of the base acres of a farm enrolled in ARC or PLC using county coverage; or

(2) 35 percent of the base acres of a farm enrolled in ARC using individual coverage.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, perennial fruits, vegetables, and wild rice may be planted or harvested on base acres of a farm and non-perennial fruits, vegetables, and wild rice may be harvested on base acres of a farm if a producer double-crops fruits, vegetables, or wild rice with a covered commodity in any region described in paragraph (e) of this section, in which case payment acres will not be reduced for the planting or harvesting of the fruit, vegetable, or wild rice.

(e) Double-cropping for purposes of this section means planting for harvest non-perennial fruits, vegetables, or wild rice on the same acres in cycle with a planted covered commodity harvested for grain in a 12-month period under normal growing conditions for the region and being able to repeat the same cycle in the following 12-month period. For purposes of this part, the following counties have been determined to be regions having a history of double-cropping covered commodities or peanuts with fruits, vegetables, or wild rice. State committees have established the following counties as regions within their respective States:

(f) The acreage of any fruit or vegetable specified in paragraph (h) of this section will first be attributed to cropland not having base acres, followed by base acres, before applying any payment acreage reduction required by paragraph (c) of this section. The reduction will be attributed to each of the covered commodities on the farm having payment acres on a pro rata basis to reflect the ratio of the payment acres of the covered commodity on the farm to the total payment acres of all covered commodities on the farm.

(g) For the purposes of this part, fruits, vegetables, and wild rice planted on payment acres of a farm under ARC or PLC Program contract:

(1) Will be considered harvested at the time of planting, unless the producer pays a fee to cover the cost of a farm visit, as specified in part 718 of this title, to verify that the fruit, vegetable, or wild rice has been destroyed before harvest, as determined by CCC, or

(2) Will not be considered as planted to a fruit, vegetable, or wild rice when reported by a producer on the farm with an intended use of green manure or forage, as determined by CCC, and a fee to cover the cost of a farm visit is paid by the producer, as specified in part 718 of this title, to verify that the crop has not been harvested.
