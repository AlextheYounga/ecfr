##### ยง 1468.20 Program requirements. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Under ACEP-ALE, NRCS will facilitate and provide cost-share assistance for the purchase by eligible entities of agricultural land easements or other interests in eligible private or Tribal land that is subject to a written pending offer from an eligible entity.

(2) To participate in ACEP-ALE, eligible entities as identified in (b) below must submit applications to NRCS State offices to partner with NRCS to acquire conservation easements on eligible land. Eligible entities with applications selected for funding must enter into an ALE-agreement with NRCS and use the NRCS required minimum deed terms specified therein, the effect of which is to protect natural resources and the agricultural nature of the land and permit the landowner the right to continue agricultural production and related uses subject to an agricultural land easement plan as approved by NRCS, the landowner, and the Grantee.

(3) Under the agreement, the Federal share of the cost of an agricultural land easement or other interest in eligible land will not exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the agricultural land easement and the eligible entity will provide a share that is at least equivalent to the Federal share, and at least 50 percent of the eligible entity share is from the eligible entity's own cash resources unless otherwise specified in this part.

(4) The duration of each agricultural land easement or other interest in land will be in perpetuity or the maximum duration permitted by State law.

(b) *Entity eligibility.* (1) To be eligible to receive ACEP-ALE funding, an Indian Tribe, State, unit of local government, or a nongovernmental organization must meet the definition of eligible entity as listed in ยง 1468.3. In addition, eligible entities interested in receiving ACEP-ALE funds must provide NRCS sufficient evidence of:

(i) A commitment to long-term conservation of agricultural lands,

(ii) A capability to acquire, manage, and enforce easements,

(iii) Sufficient number of staff dedicated to monitoring and easement stewardship, and

(iv) The availability of funds at the time of application sufficient to meet the eligible entity's contribution requirements for each parcel proposed for funding.

(2) All entities identified on the application or agreement must:

(i) Ensure that their records and the records of all landowners with parcels selected for funding have been established in the USDA customer records system and are responsible for ensuring that USDA has all the documentation needed to establish these records, and

(ii) Comply with applicable registration and reporting requirements of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-282, as amended), and 2 CFR parts 25 and 170, and maintain such registration for the duration of the ALE-agreement.

(c) *Landowner eligibility.* Under ACEP-ALE, the parcel landowners must:

(1) Be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions in 7 CFR part 12. Persons or legal entities must be in compliance with the Adjusted Gross Income Limitation provisions of 7 CFR part 1400;

(2) Agree to provide access to the property and such information to NRCS as the agency deems necessary or desirable to assist in its determination of eligibility for program implementation purposes; and

(3) Have their records established in the USDA customer records system.

(d) *Land eligibility.* (1) Land will only be considered eligible for enrollment in ACEP-ALE based on NRCS determination that such land:

(i) Is private or Tribal land on a farm or ranch subject to a written pending offer by an eligible entity,

(ii)(A) Contains at least 50 percent prime or unique farmland, or designated farm and ranch land of State or local importance unless otherwise determined by NRCS,

(B) Contains historical or archaeological resources,

(C) The enrollment of which would protect grazing uses and related conservation values by restoring and conserving land, or

(D) Furthers a State or local policy consistent with the purposes of the ACEP-ALE.

(iii) Is cropland; rangeland; grassland or land that contains forbs or shrubland for which grazing is the predominant use; located in an area that has been historically dominated by grassland, forbs, or shrubs and could provide habitat for animal or plant populations of significant ecological value; pastureland; or nonindustrial private forest land that contributes to the economic viability of a parcel offered for enrollment or serves as a buffer to protect such land from development, and

(iv) Possesses suitable onsite and offsite conditions which will allow the easement to be effective in achieving the purposes of the program.

(2) If land offered for enrollment is determined eligible under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, then NRCS may also enroll land that is incidental to the eligible land if the incidental land is determined by NRCS to be necessary for the efficient administration of an agricultural land easement.

(3) Eligible land, including eligible incidental land, may not include forest land of greater than two-thirds of the easement area unless waived by NRCS with respect to lands identified by NRCS as sugar bush that contributes to the economic viability of the parcel. Land with contiguous forest that exceeds the greater of 40 acres or 20 percent of the easement area will have a forest management plan before the easement is purchased and compensation paid to the landowner.

(e) *Ineligible land.* The following land is not eligible for enrollment in ACEP-ALE:

(2) Lands owned in fee title by a State, including an agency or a subdivision of a State, or unit of local government;

(3) Land owned by a nongovernmental organization whose purpose is to protect agricultural use and related conservation values including those listed in the statute under eligible land;

(4) Land subject to an easement or deed restriction which, as determined by NRCS, provides similar restoration and protection as would be provided by enrollment in the program;

(5) Land where the purposes of the program would be undermined due to onsite or offsite conditions, such as risk of hazardous substances, proposed or existing rights of way, infrastructure development, or adjacent land uses;

(6) Land which NRCS determines to have unacceptable exceptions to clear title or insufficient legal access; or

(7) Land on which gas, oil, earth, or mineral rights exploration has been leased or is owned by someone other than the landowner is ineligible under ACEP-ALE unless it is determined by NRCS that the third party rights will not harm or interfere with the conservation values or agricultural uses of the easement, that any methods of exploration and extraction will have only a limited and localized impact on the easement, and the limitations are specified in the ALE deed.
