##### ยง 1468.38 The WRPO development. #####

(a) The WRPO will be developed as determined by NRCS in consultation with the State Technical Committee and consideration of available site-specific technical input from FWS and others as appropriate.

(b) The WRPO will specify the manner in which the enrolled land will be restored, protected, enhanced, maintained, and managed to accomplish the goals of the program. The WRPO will be developed to ensure that cost effective restoration and maximization of wildlife benefits and wetland functions and values will result. Specifically, the WRPO will consider and address, to the extent practicable, the onsite alternations and the offsite watershed conditions that adversely impact the hydrology and associated wildlife and wetland functions and values.
