##### ยง 1470.27 Contract violations and termination. #####

(a) NRCS may terminate a contract:

(1) Without the consent of the participant where it determines that the participant:

(i) Violated the contract; or

(ii) Is unable to comply with the terms of the contract as the result of conditions beyond their control.

(2) With the consent of the participant if NRCS determines that the termination is in the public interest.

(b) NRCS may allow a participant in a contract terminated in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, to retain a portion of any payments received appropriate to the effort the participant has made to comply with the contract, or in cases of hardship, where forces beyond the participant's control prevented compliance with the contract. The condition that is the basis for the participant's inability to comply with the contract must not have existed at the time the contract was executed by the participant. If a participant believes that such a hardship condition exists, the participant may submit a request with NRCS for relief pursuant to this paragraph and any such request must contain documentation sufficient for NRCS to make a determination that this hardship condition exists.

(c) If NRCS determines that a participant is not in compliance with the contract terms or documents incorporated therein, NRCS will notify the participant about the actions the participant must take to be determined in compliance and the consequences of the failure to remedy the violation. NRCS will provide a reasonable period of time for the participant to complete all necessary actions, not to exceed one year. NRCS may authorize an additional period of time if NRCS determines that the participant is willing and able to comply but has not been able to complete the necessary actions during the initial period of time as a result of conditions beyond their control. If a participant continues in violation, NRCS may terminate the CSP contract in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.

(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, a contract termination will be effective immediately upon a determination by NRCS that the participant:

(1) Has submitted false information or filed a false claim;

(2) Engaged in any act, scheme, or device for which a finding of ineligibility for payments is permitted under the provisions of ยง 1470.36; or

(3) Incurred in a violation of the contract provisions that cannot be corrected in a timeframe established by NRCS.

(e) If NRCS terminates a contract, the participant will forfeit all rights to future payments under the contract, pay liquidated damages, and refund all or part of the payments received, plus interest.

(1) NRCS may require a participant to provide only a partial refund of the payments received if a previously installed conservation activity has achieved the expected conservation performance improvement, is not adversely affected by the violation or the absence of other conservation activities that would have been installed under the contract, and has met the associated operation and maintenance requirement of the activity; and

(2) NRCS will have the option to reduce or waive the liquidated damages, depending upon the circumstances of the case when terminating a contract, NRCS may reduce the amount of money owed by the participant by a proportion that reflects the good faith effort of the participant to comply with the contract or the existence of hardships beyond the participant's control that have prevented compliance with the contract.
