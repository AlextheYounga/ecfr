##### ยง 1470.25 Voluntary contract modifications and transfers of land. #####

(a) NRCS may modify a conservation stewardship contract, if:

(1) The participant agrees to the modification, and

(2) NRCS determines the modification is in the public interest.

(b) NRCS may allow modification to a conservation stewardship contract to accommodate certain changes in the agricultural operation, such as to remove contract acres to be enrolled in CRP, protected by a wetland reserve easement through ACEP, or enrolled in other Federal or State programs that offer greater natural resource protection through an easement, long-term contract, land use restrictions, or similar authority as determined by NRCS. Payments for such modified contracts will be reduced to reflect the modified acreage and performance. Participants will not be subject to liquidated damages or refund of payments received for enrolling land in these programs. NRCS may also approve modification to a conservation stewardship contract to accommodate other limited changes on land that the participant has effective control in response to a participant's request made prior to implementing the change that would take land out of production or convert an area under contract to a different land use. Prior to approval, NRCS must determine that any modification under this section is authorized by the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 3838d-3838g.

(c) A voluntary contract modification under this section will not increase the scheduled annual payments under the program, except to implement an appeal determination or correct an administrative error as approved by NRCS. Successor in interest or other changes made to the structure of an operation are subject to this limitation on contract agreement.

(d) Within the time specified in the contract, a participant must provide NRCS with written notice regarding any voluntary or involuntary loss of control of any acreage under the CSP contract, which includes changes in a participant's ownership structure or corporate form. Failure to provide timely notice will result in termination of the entire contract.

(e) Unless NRCS approves a transfer of contract rights under this paragraph, a participant losing control of any acreage will constitute a violation of the CSP contract and NRCS will terminate the contract and require a participant to refund all or a portion of any financial assistance provided. NRCS may approve a transfer of the contract if:

(1) NRCS receives written notice that identifies the new producer who will take control of the acreage, as required in paragraph (d) of this section;

(2) The new producer meets program eligibility requirements within a reasonable time frame, as specified in the CSP contract;

(3) The new producer agrees to assume the rights and responsibilities for the acreage under the contract; and

(4) NRCS determines that the purposes of the program will continue to be met despite the original participant's losing control of all or a portion of the land under contract.

(f) Until NRCS approves the transfer of contract rights, the new producer is not a participant in the program and may not receive payment for conservation activities commenced prior to approval of the contract transfer.

(g) NRCS may not approve a contract transfer and may terminate the contract in its entirety if NRCS determines that the loss of control of the land was voluntary, the new producer is not eligible or willing to assume responsibilities under the contract, or the purposes of the program cannot be met.
