##### ยง 1403.10 Waiver of late payment interest, additional interest and administrative charges. #####

(a) Except for debts resulting from price support loans, CCC shall waive the collection of late payment interest and administrative charges on a debt or any portion of a debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which late payment interest began to accrue.

(b) CCC may waive the assessment and collection of all or a portion of the additional interest on debts which are appealed in accordance with 7 CFR part 780, or other applicable appeal procedures, from either the date of the appeal or the date of delinquency, as determined by CCC, until the date a final administrative determination is issued. However, with respect to CCC programs administered by the Foreign Agricultural Service, CCC shall waive the assessment and collection of additional interest on debts which are appealed in accordance with 7 CFR part 780, or other applicable appeal procedures, from the date of delinquency until 30 days after the date of the letter informing the appellant of the final administrative determination. The waiver provisions of the paragraph shall not apply during any period of delay due to:

(1) The appellant's request for a postponement of the scheduled hearing;

(2) The appellant's request for an additional time following the hearing to present additional information or a written closing statement; or

(3) The appellant's failure to timely present information to the reviewing authority.

(c) Assessment and collection of late payment interest, additional interest and administrative charges under this part may be waived by CCC in full, or in part, if it is determined that such action is in the best interest of CCC.
