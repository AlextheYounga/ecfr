(2) With respect to a landowner only, a change from a cash rent to a share rent; or

(3) An increase through the acquisition of base acres not previously involved in the farming operation of at least 20 percent or more in the total base acres involved in the farming operation.

(5) A change in ownership by sale or gift of land from a person or legal entity who previously has been engaged in a farming operation to a person or legal entity that has not been involved in such operation. The sale or gift of land will be considered to be bona fide and substantive only if:

(i) The transferred amount of such land is commensurate with the new person's or legal entity's share of the farming operation,

(ii) The sale or gift of land was based on the land's fair market value,

(iii) The former owner of the land has no direct or indirect control over such land,

(iv) The transaction was not financed by the former owner, and
