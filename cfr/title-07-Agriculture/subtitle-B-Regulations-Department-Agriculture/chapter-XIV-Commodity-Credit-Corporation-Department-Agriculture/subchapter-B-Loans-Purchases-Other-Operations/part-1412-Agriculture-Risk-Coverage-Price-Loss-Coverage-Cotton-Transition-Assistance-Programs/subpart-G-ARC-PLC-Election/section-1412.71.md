##### ยง 1412.71 Election of ARC or PLC. #####

(a) All of the current producers on a farm must make a one-time election that is both:

(1) Unanimous, and

(2) Irrevocable.

(b) The election by current producers is to obtain -

(1) Either PLC or ARC-CO on a covered commodity-by-covered-commodity basis on the farm; or

(2) ARC-IC for all covered commodities on the farm.

(c) In general, a valid election will also apply to any subsequent year parent to the farm reconstitution as well as farms resulting from the parent farm as specified in ยง 1412.73. Neither the requesting of a farm reconstitution nor the reconstitution of any farm will impact either the requirement that all current producers on a farm must make the unanimous irrevocable election in the defined election period or the valid election that was previously made by those current producers.

(d) Beginning with the 2018 crop year, a valid election for seed cotton is required for all current producers on a farm where seed cotton is added as a covered commodity, as specified in ยง 1412.25, unless the farm contains a valid ARC-IC election. A valid ARC-IC election on a farm is for all covered commodities and will include the added covered commodity of seed cotton. This election is for seed cotton only. All other covered commodities on a farm with seed cotton base acres have an election on file and will be bound by that prior election. The election by all current producers is to obtain:

(1) PLC for seed cotton base acres, or

(2) ARC-CO for seed cotton base acres.

(e) FSA will process elections from current producers on a farm based on the election as submitted. For example, if the current producers of a farm attest that they are all or the only current producers on the farm and FSA later learns that there was another current producer at the time of election who did not agree to the election, the election is invalid. If at any time FSA determines that an election fails to satisfy the requirements of this subpart because it did not include the unanimous agreement of all current producers on the farm at the time of election, the election will immediately be invalid. This is not a compliance provision. Only valid elections by all current producers will be recognized and used by CCC. All ARC and PLC payments that were issued to any producers on a farm based on an election later determined by CCC to be invalid, for whatever reason, regardless of whether those producers who were issued unearned payments personally made or participated in the invalid election, must be refunded with interest.

(f) Election is separate from enrollment; producers on farms that have validly completed an election by the current producers in the prescribed election period must still annually enroll as specified in subpart D for PLC and ARC payments, as applicable.
