*Access* means legal and physical ingress and egress to the entire easement area over adjacent or contiguous lands for the exercise of any of the rights or interests under the easement for the duration of its term for the purposes of the program. Access for easement enrollments must be described in the easement deed.

*Acreage owned by Indian Tribes* means lands held in private ownership by an Indian Tribe or individual Tribal member and lands held in trust by a native corporation, Tribe or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

*Active agricultural production* means that on lands that meet the definition of being in agricultural use, agricultural or forest-related products or livestock are being produced or have been produced within one year of the date of application by an eligible entity for funding under subpart B of this part. Land may also be considered in active agricultural production if it is current or former CRP land that is planted, considered planted, or in conserving use as determined by NRCS.

*Agreement* means the document that specifies the obligations and rights of NRCS and any person, legal entity, or eligible entity who is participating in the program or any document that authorizes the transfer of assistance between NRCS and a third party for provision of authorized goods and services associated with program implementation. Agreements may include but are not limited to an agreement to purchase, an ALE-agreement, a wetland reserve easement restoration agreement, a cooperative agreement, a partnership agreement, or an interagency agreement.

*Agreement to purchase* means the legal document that is the equivalent of a real estate purchase and sale contract. The landowner signs the agreement to purchase, which is the authorization for NRCS to proceed with the wetland reserve easement acquisition process and to incur costs for surveys, title clearance, due diligence activities, and closing procedures on the easement.

*Agricultural commodity* means any agricultural commodity planted and produced in a State by annual tilling of the soil, including tilling by one-trip planters or sugarcane planted and produced in a State.

*Agricultural uses* means those activities defined by a State's farm or ranch land protection program, or where no program exists, by the State agricultural use tax assessment program. However, if NRCS determines that a State definition of agricultural use is so broad that an included use would constitute a violation of Federal law, degrade soils, the agricultural nature of the land or the related natural resources, NRCS reserves the right to impose greater deed restrictions on the property to be subject to an agricultural land easement. These deed restrictions would narrow the State definition of agricultural use in order to meet Federal law, or to protect soils, the agricultural nature of the land, or related natural resources.

*Agricultural land easement* means an easement or other interest in eligible land that is conveyed for the purposes of protecting natural resources and the agricultural nature of the land, and of promoting agricultural viability for future generations, and permits the landowner the right to continue agricultural production and related uses subject to an agricultural land easement plan.

*Agricultural land easement plan* means the document developed by NRCS or provided by the eligible entity and approved by NRCS, in consultation with the eligible entity and landowner, that describes the activities that promote the long-term viability of the land to meet the purposes for which the easement was acquired. The agricultural land easement plan includes a description of the farm or ranch management system, conservation practices that address applicable resource concerns for which the easement was enrolled, and any required component plans such as a grasslands management plan, forest management plan, or conservation plan as defined in this part. Where appropriate, the agricultural land easement plan will include conversion of highly erodible cropland to less intensive uses.

*ALE-agreement* means the financial assistance document that specifies the obligations and rights of NRCS and eligible entities participating in the program under subpart B, including a cooperative agreement or grant agreement.

*At-risk species* means any plant or animal species listed as threatened or endangered; proposed or candidate for listing under the Endangered Species Act; a species listed as threatened or endangered under State law or Tribal law; State or Tribal land species of conservation concern; or other plant or animal species or community, as determined by the State Conservationist, with advice from the State Technical Committee or Tribal Conservation Advisory Council, that has undergone, or is likely to undergo, population decline and may become imperiled without direct intervention.

*Beginning farmer or rancher* means an individual or legal entity who:
