*Grazing animals* mean those species of livestock that, from a nutritional and physiological perspective, satisfy more than 50 percent of their net energy requirement through the consumption of growing forage grasses and legumes. Species of livestock for which more than 50 percent of their net energy requirements are not recommended to be met from consumption of forage grasses and legumes, such as poultry and swine, are excluded regardless of whether those species are grazing or are present on grazing land or pastureland.

*Grazing loss* means the value, as calculated in § 1416.110(g) or (m), of eligible grazing lost due to an eligible adverse weather or eligible loss condition based on the number of days that the eligible livestock were not able to graze the eligible grazing land during the normal grazing period.

*U.S. Drought Monitor* is a system for classifying drought severity according to a range of abnormally dry to exceptional drought. It is a collaborative effort between Federal and academic partners, produced on a weekly basis, to synthesize multiple indices, outlooks, and drought impacts on a map and in narrative form. This synthesis of indices is reported by the National Drought Mitigation Center at *http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu.* Should an eligible area not be covered by the U.S. Drought Monitor, the Deputy Administrator, in consultation with appropriate weather-related agencies and experts, will establish procedures for rating drought intensity using the same range of categories as the U.S. Drought Monitor and use this information in place of the missing data for eligibility purposes.

*Verifiable record* means a document provided by the producer that can be verified by the County Committee (COC) through an independent source and is used to substantiate the claimed loss.
