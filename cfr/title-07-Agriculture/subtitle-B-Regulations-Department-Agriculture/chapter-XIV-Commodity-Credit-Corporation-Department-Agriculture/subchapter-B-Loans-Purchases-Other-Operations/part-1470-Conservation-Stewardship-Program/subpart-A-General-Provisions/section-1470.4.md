##### ยง 1470.4 Allocation and management. #####

(a) The Chief will allocate acres and associated funds to States:

(1) Based on the consideration of:

(i) Each State's proportion of eligible land to the total acreage of eligible land in all States:

(ii) The extent and magnitude of the conservation needs associated with agricultural production in each State,

(iii) The degree to which implementation of the program in the State is, or will be, effective in helping producers address those needs, and

(iv) Other considerations determined by the Chief to achieve equitable geographic distribution of program funds.

(b) NRCS will allocate acres to ranking pools, to the extent practicable, based on the same factors the Chief considers in making allocations to States.

(c) Of the acres made available for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2018 to carry out CSP, NRCS will use, as a minimum:

(1) Five percent to assist beginning farmers or ranchers, and

(2) Five percent to assist socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers.

(d) NRCS will provide priority under paragraph (c) to any producer who is a veteran farmer or rancher.

(e) NRCS may adjust the allocations to States in any fiscal year if it is determined an allocation cannot be utilized in a State. Additionally, allocated acres that are not enrolled by a date determined by NRCS may be reallocated with associated funds for use in that fiscal year under CSP. As part of the adjustments or reallocation process, NRCS will consider several factors, including demand from applicants, national and regional conservation priorities, and prior-year CSP performance in States.
