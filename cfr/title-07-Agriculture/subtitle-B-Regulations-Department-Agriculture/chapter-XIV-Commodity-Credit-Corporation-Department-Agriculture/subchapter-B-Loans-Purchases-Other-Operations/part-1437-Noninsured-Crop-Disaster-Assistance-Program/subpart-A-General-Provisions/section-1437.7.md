(1) The product obtained by multiplying:

(i) A 5.25-percent premium fee; and

(ii) The applicable payment limit; or

(g) Beginning farmers and ranchers, limited resource farmers and ranchers, and socially disadvantaged farmers or ranchers will receive, upon certification, a waiver of the service fee and a 50 percent premium reduction. The certification is required on or before the time the application for coverage is filed using the form specified by FSA.

(h) Transfers of NAP coverage are governed by the basic provisions.

(i) For the 2015 crop year, if a crop's application closing date is before January 14, 2015, FSA will accept applications for coverage without regard to whether or not the application for coverage was filed by the crop's application closing date, provided that the application for coverage includes buy-up coverage according to ยง 1437.5(d) and is filed by January 14, 2015. Except as specifically stated in this rule, the provisions of this paragraph (i) do not apply to crops having an application closing date established on or after December 15, 2014 or to applications for coverage that do not include buy-up coverage as an option selected by the applicant.
