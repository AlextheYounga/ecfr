(a) Except for contracts entered into prior to February 7, 2014, which are subject to regulations and contract requirements in effect prior to February 7, 2014, or as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the total amount of payments paid to a person or legal entity under this part may not exceed an aggregate of $450,000, directly or indirectly, for all contracts entered into during fiscal years 2014 through 2018. Payments received for technical assistance will be excluded from this limitation. The limitation in this subsection cannot be waived.

(b) Payments for conservation practices related to organic production to a person or legal entity, directly or indirectly, may not exceed in aggregate $20,000 per fiscal year or $80,000 during any 6-year period.

(c) To determine eligibility for payments, NRCS will use the following criteria:

(1) The provisions in 7 CFR part 1400, Payment Limitation and Payment Eligibility.

(2) States, political subdivisions, and entities thereof are not considered to be producers eligible for payment.

(3) To be eligible to receive an EQIP payment, all legal entities or persons applying, either alone or as part of a joint operation, must provide a tax identification number and percentage interest in the legal entity. In accordance with 7 CFR part 1400, an applicant applying as a joint operation or legal entity must provide a list of all members of the legal entity and joint operation and associated embedded entities, along with the members' social security numbers and percentage interest in the joint operation or legal entity.

(4) Contracts with Indian Tribes are not subject to payment or contract limitations. Indian Tribes will certify in writing that no one individual, directly or indirectly, will receive more than the payment limitation. Certification provided at the time of enrollment will cover the entire contract period. The Tribal entity must also provide, upon request from NRCS, a listing of individuals and payment made, by Social Security number or other unique identification number, during the previous year for calculation of overall payment limitations.

(i) Payment limitations apply to individual Tribal member(s) when applying and subsequently being granted a contract as an individual(s). American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification number for each individual eligible for payment.

(ii) Any individual Tribal member that is identified utilizing a unique identification number as an alternative to a tax identification number will utilize only that identifier for all contracts to which the individual Tribal member receives a payment directly or indirectly.

(5) To be eligible to receive a payment, all legal entities or persons applying, either alone or as part of a joint operation, must provide a tax identification number and percentage interest in the legal entity. In accordance with 7 CFR part 1400, an applicant applying as a joint operation or legal entity must provide a list of all members of the legal entity and joint operation and associated embedded entities, along with the members' Social Security numbers and percentage of interest in the joint operation or legal entity.

(6) Any cooperative association of producers that markets commodities for producers will not be considered to be a person eligible for payment.

(7) Eligibility for payments in accordance with part 7 CFR part 1400, average adjusted gross income limitation, will be determined prior to contract approval.

(8) To be eligible for payments for conservation practices related to organic production or the transition to organic production:

(i) Participants who are USDA certified organic producers will implement conservation practices that are consistent with an approved organic system plan (OSP), and

(ii) Participants who are transitioning to organic production (including participants who are exempt from certification as defined by the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990) will develop an OSP and implement conservation practices that are consistent with OSP requirements and purposes of the program.

(9) A participant will not be eligible for payments for conservation practices on eligible land if the participant receives payments or other benefits for the same practice to address the same resource concern on the same land under any other conservation program administered by USDA.

(10) NRCS may issue advance payments to participants that are historically underserved producers up to 50 percent of the anticipated amount of the costs incurred for the purpose of purchasing materials or services to implement a conservation practice. Eligibility for advance payment is contingent upon the requirement that the participant must obtain an NRCS approved practice design prior to approval of the advance payment. Advance funds paid to program participants must be expended within 90 days from receipt of funds or returned to NRCS within a reasonable time as determined by NRCS.

(11) Before NRCS will approve and issue any EQIP payment, the participant must certify that the conservation practice has been completed in accordance with contract requirements, and NRCS or an approved TSP must certify that the practice has been carried out in accordance with the applicable NRCS FOTG technical standards.
