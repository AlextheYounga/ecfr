##### ยง 1466.5 Outreach activities. #####

NRCS will establish program outreach activities at the national, State, Tribal, and local levels in order to ensure that producers whose land has environmental problems and priority resource concerns are aware and informed that they may be eligible to apply for program assistance. Special outreach will be made to eligible producers with historically low participation rates, including but not restricted to, limited resource, socially disadvantaged, small-scale, or beginning farmers or ranchers, veteran farmers or ranchers, Indian Tribes, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders. NRCS provides outreach so as not to limit producer participation because of size or type of operation, or production system, including small-scale, specialty crop, and organic production.
