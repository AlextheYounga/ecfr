##### ยง 1487.6 What are the criteria for evaluating proposals? #####

(a) *Evaluation criteria.* FAS will use the following criteria in evaluating proposals:

(1) The nature of the specific export barrier and the extent to which the proposal is likely to successfully remove, resolve, or mitigate that barrier;

(2) The potential trade impact of the proposed project on market retention, market access, and market expansion, including the potential for expanding commercial sales in the targeted market;

(3) The completeness and viability of the proposal;

(4) The ability of the organization to provide an experienced staff with the requisite technical and trade experience to execute the proposal;

(5) The extent to which the proposal is targeted to a market in which the United States is generally competitive;

(6) The cost of the project and the amount of other resources dedicated to the project, including cash and goods and services of the U.S. industry and foreign third parties;

(7) The degree to which time is essential to addressing specific export barriers;

(8) In cases where the CCC receives multiple proposals from different applicants which address essentially the same barrier, the nature of the applicant organization will be taken into consideration, with a greater weight given to those organizations with the broadest base of producer representation.

(b) *Evaluation process.* FAS will review all proposals for eligibility and completeness and will evaluate each proposal against the factors described in paragraph (a) of this section. The purpose of this review is to identify meritorious proposals, recommend an appropriate funding level for each proposal, and submit the proposals and funding recommendations to appropriate officials within FAS for decision. FAS may, when appropriate to the subject matter of the proposal, request the assistance of other U.S. government experts in evaluating the merits of a proposal.
