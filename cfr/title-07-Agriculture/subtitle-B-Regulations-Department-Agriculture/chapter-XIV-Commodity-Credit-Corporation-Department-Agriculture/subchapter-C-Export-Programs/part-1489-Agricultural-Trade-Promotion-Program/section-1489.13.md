Applicants may apply to conduct a generic promotion program and/or a brand promotion program that provides ATP funds to brand participants for branded promotion, as well as to conduct other market promotion activities including activities to address existing or potential non-tariff trade barriers. An applicant that is a U.S. agricultural cooperative may also apply for funds to conduct its own brand promotion program.

(i) The name, address, and internet location of the home page of the applicant organization;

(ii) The name of the applicant's Chief Executive Officer;

(iii) The name, telephone number, fax number, and email address of the applicant's primary contact person;

(iv) The name(s) of the person(s) responsible for managing the proposed program;

(v) A description of the applicant organization, including the type of organization of the applicant (*e.g.,* nonprofit SRTG), its mission, and the statutory authorities by which it is constituted and under which it operates, if applicable;

(2) *Program justification.* All applications shall contain:

(i) A description of the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity(s), its harmonized tariff classification, the applicable commodity aggregate code (available from the UES website) and the percentage of U.S. origin content by weight, exclusive of added water;

(ii) A description of the anticipated supply and demand situation for the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity(s) as well as a demonstration of loss suffered as a result of imposed tariffs (reduced sales, lost revenue, and decreased market share, etc.);

(iii) The volume and value of exports of the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity(s) to the targeted markets for the most recent 3-year period;

(iv) If the proposal is for 2 or more years, an explanation why the proposal should be funded on a multi-year basis; and

(v) A certification and, if requested by CCC, a written explanation supporting the certification that any funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or third-party funds or other contributions to program activities. An explanation, if one is requested, shall indicate why the applicant is unlikely to carry out the activities without Federal financial assistance. In determining whether Federal funds would supplement or supplant private or third-party funds or contributions, CCC will consider the applicant's prior overall marketing budget in CCC market development programs from year-to-year, variations in promotional strategies within a country, and new markets.

(3) *Proposed program's strategic plan.* (i) All applications shall include a strategic plan that contains:

(A) A description of overall long term strategic goals to be advanced by the proposed activities for the ensuing 3-5 years;

(B) An explanation of the organization's strategic planning process and identification of priority target markets, including a summary of proposed budgets by country and commodity aggregate code;

(C) A description of the world market situation for the exported U.S. agricultural commodity(s);

(D) A description of competition from other exporters;

(E) An evaluation plan describing the applicant's goals and the applicant's plans for monitoring and evaluating performance towards achieving these goals. This evaluation plan should set forth specific goals and benchmarks set at regular intervals to be used to identify results against identified constraints and opportunities and to measure progress made in the target market. Evaluation of a proposed ATP program's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by the applicant of goals, method of achievement, and expected results of programming at regular intervals. The overall goal of the ATP and of individual Participants' programming is to restore or increase sales that would not have occurred in the absence of ATP funding. An ATP Participant may modify and resubmit this plan for re-approval at any time during the program period.

(3) The demonstration project is a practical and cost effective method of overcoming the constraint; and

(4) A third-party must participate in such project through a written agreement with the ATP Participant.
