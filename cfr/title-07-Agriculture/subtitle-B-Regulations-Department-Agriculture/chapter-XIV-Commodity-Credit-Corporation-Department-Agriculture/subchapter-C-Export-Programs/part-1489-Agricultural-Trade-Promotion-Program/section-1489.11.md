*Approval letter* means a document by which the CCC informs an applicant that its ATP application has been approved for funding. This letter may also approve specific activities and contain terms and conditions in addition to the program agreement. This letter requires a countersignature by the ATP Participant before it becomes effective.

*ATP* means the Agricultural Trade Promotion Program.

*ATP Notice* means Agricultural Trade Promotion Program notices are documents that CCC issues for informational purposes. These ATP notices are made available electronically at *www.fas.usda.gov/programs/agricultural-trade-promotion-program-atp.* These notices have no legal effect. They are intended to alert ATP Participants of various aspects of CCC's current administration of the ATP program. For example, CCC issues ATP notices to alert ATP Participants of procedures for requesting advances, applicable Federal pay scale rates, lists of economic and trade sanctions against certain foreign countries, reporting formats and computer codes to use with the UES.

*ATP Participant or Participant* means an entity that has entered into an ATP program agreement with the CCC.

*Attaché/Counselor* means the FAS employee representing USDA interests in the foreign country in which promotional activities are conducted.

*Brand participant* means a U.S. for-profit entity or a U.S. agricultural cooperative that owns the brand(s) of the U.S. agricultural commodity to be promoted or has the exclusive rights to use such brand(s) and that is participating in the ATP brand promotion program of an ATP Participant. This definition does not include any U.S. agricultural cooperatives that are ATP Participants that apply for ATP funds to implement their own brand programs.

*Brand promotion* means an activity that involves the exclusive or predominant use of a single U.S. company name, or the logo or brand name of a single U.S. company, or the brand of a U.S. agricultural cooperative, or any activity undertaken by a brand participant in the brand program.

*CCC* means the Commodity Credit Corporation, including any agency or official of the United States delegated the responsibility to act on behalf of the CCC.

*Contribution* means an expenditure made by an ATP Participant, the U.S. industry, or State agency in support of an approved activity. This includes expenditures to be made by entities in the ATP Participant's industry in support of the entities' related promotion activities in the markets covered by the ATP Participant's agreement.

*Credit memo* means a commercial document, also known as a credit memorandum, issued by the ATP Participant to a commercial entity that owes the ATP Participant a certain sum. A credit memo is used when the ATP Participant owes the commercial entity a sum less than the amount the entity owes the Participant. The credit memo reflects an offset of the amount the ATP Participant owes the entity against the amount the entity owes to the ATP Participant.

*Demonstration projects* means activities involving the erection or construction of a structure or facility or the installation of equipment.

*Foreign third party* means a foreign entity that an ATP Participant works with to promote the export of a U.S. agricultural commodity under the ATP program.

*Generic promotion* means an activity that is not a brand promotion but, rather, promotes a U.S. agricultural commodity generally. A generic promotion activity may include the promotion of a foreign brand (*i.e.,* a brand owned primarily by foreign interests and being used to market a commodity or product in a foreign market), if the foreign brand uses the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity from multiple U.S. suppliers. A generic promotion activity may also involve the use of specific U.S. company names, logos or brand names. However, in that case, the ATP Participant must ensure that all U.S. companies seeking to promote such U.S. agricultural commodity in the market have an equal opportunity to participate in the activity and that at least two U.S. companies participate. In addition, an activity that promotes separate items from multiple U.S. companies will be considered a generic promotion only if the promotion of the separate items maintains a unified theme (*i.e.,* a dominant idea or motif) and style and is subordinate to the promotion of the generic theme.

*Market* means the country or countries targeted by an activity.

*Notification* means a document from the ATP Participant by which the ATP Participant proposes to CCC changes to the activities and/or funding levels in an approved ATP program agreement and/or approval letter.

*Product samples* means a representative part of a larger whole promoted commodity or group of promoted commodities. Product samples include all forms of a promoted commodity (*e.g.,* fresh or processed), independent of the ultimate utilization of the sample. Product samples must be used in support of international marketing activities including, but not limited to, displays, food process testing, cooking demonstrations, or trade and consumer tastings.

*Program agreement* means a document entered into between CCC and an ATP Participant setting forth the terms and conditions of approved activities under ATP, including any subsequent amendments to such agreement.
