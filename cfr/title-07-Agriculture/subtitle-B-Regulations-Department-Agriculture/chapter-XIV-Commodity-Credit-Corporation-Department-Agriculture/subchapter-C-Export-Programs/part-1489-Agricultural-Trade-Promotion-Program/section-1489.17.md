##### § 1489.17 Reimbursement rules. #####

(a) An ATP Participant may seek reimbursement for an eligible expenditure if:

(1) The expenditure was necessary and reasonable for accomplishment of an approved activity; and

(2) The Participant has not been and will not be reimbursed for such expenditure by any other source.

(b) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, as well as applicable cost principles (*e.g.,* 2 CFR part 200) to the extent these principles do not directly conflict with the provisions of this subpart, for either brand or generic promotion activities, the CCC will reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

(1) Production and placement of advertising, in print, electronic media, billboards, or posters, which may include advertising the availability of price discounts, except that advertising associated with a coupon or price discount for the ATP-promoted product is not reimbursable. If advertising is related to both coupons or price discounts for products other than the ATP Participant's promoted products as well as for ATP-promoted products, expenditures for such advertising will not be reimbursed in whole or in part (*e.g.,* expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement). Electronic media includes, but is not limited to, radio, television, electronic mail, internet, telephone, text messaging, and podcasting;

(2) Production and distribution of banners, recipe cards, table tents, shelf talkers, and other similar point of sale materials;

(3) Direct mail advertising;

(4) In-store and food service promotions, product demonstrations to the trade and to consumers, and distribution of product samples (but not the purchase of the product samples, except as authorized in paragraph (c)(9) of this section).

(5) Temporary displays and rental of space for temporary displays;

(6) Expenditures, other than travel expenditures, associated with seminars and educational training, whether conducted in the United States or outside the United States;

(7) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, expenditures, other than travel expenditures, associated with retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows, whether held outside or inside the United States, including participation fees, booth construction, transportation of related materials, rental of space and equipment, and duplication of related printed materials. However, with regard to non-travel expenditures associated with retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States, such expenditures are reimbursable only if the exhibit or show is: A food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from countries other than the host country. CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which ATP reimbursement is available and such list will be announced to ATP Participants via an ATP notice issued on FAS' website;

(8) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for no more than two representatives of a single brand participant (or ATP Participant directly running its own brand program) to exhibit their company's (or cooperative's) products at a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held outside the United States. Representatives may include employees and board members of private companies, employees or members of cooperatives, or any broker, consultant, or marketing representative contracted by the company or cooperative to represent the company or cooperative in sales transactions. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route;

(9) Subscriptions that are of a technical, economic, or marketing nature and that are relevant to the approved activities of the ATP Participant;

(10) Demonstrators, interpreters, translators, receptionists, and similar temporary workers who help with the implementation of individual promotional activities, such as trade shows, in-store promotions, food service promotions, and trade seminars;

(11) Giveaways, awards, prizes, gifts and other similar promotional materials, subject to such reimbursement limitation as CCC may determine and announce in writing to ATP Participants via an ATP notice issued on FAS' website. Reimbursement is available only when:

(i) The items are described in detail with a per unit cost in an approved strategic plan; and

(ii) Distribution of the promotional item is not contingent upon the consumer, or other target audience, purchasing a good or service to receive the promotional item;

(12) The design and production of packaging, labeling or origin identification, to be used during the program period in which the expenditure is made, if such packaging, labeling or origin identification is necessary to meet the importing requirements of a foreign country;

(13) The design, production, and distribution of coupons for products other than the ATP Participant's promoted products. If such activities include both coupons or price discounts for products other than the ATP Participant's promoted products as well as for ATP-promoted products, expenditures for such activities will not be reimbursed in whole or in part (*e.g.,* expenditures may not be prorated and submitted for reimbursement);

(14) An audit of an ATP Participant as required by 2 CFR part 200, subpart F, if the ATP is the ATP Participant's largest source of Federal funding;

(16) Expenditures associated with developing, updating, and servicing websites on the internet that clearly target a foreign audience;

(17) International travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, incurred for a foreign trade mission conducted outside the United States that is an activity under an approved branded program and that has met the following conditions:

(i) Trade mission travel for company (or cooperative) representatives was identified as a separate approved activity in the ATP Participant's UES;

(ii) The trade mission included representatives, as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, from a minimum of five different companies (or cooperatives), and no more than two representatives from each participating company (or cooperative);

(iii) The appropriate FAS overseas office supported the trade mission by dedicating meaningful funding or other resources (such as facilities or staff time) to the activity; and

(iv) The ATP Participant with the approved brand program produced an itinerary or agenda for the trade mission that demonstrated that company (or cooperative) representatives would be engaged for a minimum of 6 hours per day (except for the first and last days of the mission) in trade mission activities that include, at a minimum, each of the following:

(A) A product showcase where the FAS overseas office approved an invitation list of qualified buyers;

(B) Pre-arranged one-on-one business meetings; and

(C) Evaluation and feedback sessions with FAS staff and trade mission sponsors.

(v) Reimbursement is conditional on the ATP Participant having notified in writing the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route;

(18) Where USDA has sponsored or endorsed a U.S. pavilion at a retail, trade and consumer exhibit or show, whether held outside or inside the United States, ATP funds may be used to reimburse the travel and/or non-travel expenditures of only those ATP Participants located within the U.S. pavilion. Such expenditures must also adhere to the standard terms and conditions of the U.S. pavilion organizer. All travel should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Upon written request, the CCC may temporarily waive this subsection, on a case by case basis, where:

(i) The trade show is segregated into product pavilions; or

(ii) A company's distributor or importer is located outside the U.S. pavilion. Such waiver will be provided to the ATP Participant in writing; and

(19) Contracts with U.S.-based organizations when the only contracted service such organizations provide to an ATP Participant is carrying out a specific market promotion activity in the United States directed to a foreign audience (*e.g.,* a trade mission of foreign buyers coming to the United States to visit U.S. exporters). Such contracts may be reimbursable as a direct promotional expense. If a U.S.-based organization provides administrative services to the ATP Participant's domestic home office during a program period, any direct promotional services such organization provides to the Participant, whether for the Participant's domestic or overseas offices, during the same program period are not reimbursable.

(c) Subject to paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section as well as applicable cost principles (*e.g.,* 2 CFR part 200), but for generic promotion activities only, the CCC will also reimburse, in whole or in part, the cost of:

(1) Temporary contractor fees for contractors stationed overseas, except the CCC will not reimburse any portion of any such fee that exceeds the daily gross salary of a GS-15, Step 10 for U.S. Government employees in effect on the date the fee is earned, unless a bidding process reveals that such a contractor is not available at or below that salary rate;

(2) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, international travel expenditures, not to exceed the full fare economy rate, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased airline ticket, per diem, passports, visas and inoculations, for activities held outside the United States or in the United States, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, except that if the activity is participation in a retail, trade, or consumer exhibit or show held inside the United States, international travel expenditures are covered only if the exhibit or show is: A food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from countries other than the United States. The CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which ATP reimbursement is available and such list will be announced to ATP Participants via an ATP notice issued on FAS' website.

(i) The CCC generally will not reimburse any portion of air travel, including any fees for modifying the originally purchased ticket, in excess of the full fare economy rate or when the ATP Participant fails to notify the Attaché/Counselor in the destination country in advance of the travel, unless the CCC determines it was impractical to provide such notice. If a traveler flies in business class or a different premium class, the basis for reimbursement will be the full fare economy class rate for the same flight and the ATP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such full fare economy class rate to support its reimbursement claim. If economy class is not offered for the same flight or if the traveler flies on a charter flight, the basis for reimbursement will be the average of the full fare economy class rate for flights offered by three different airlines between the same points on the same date and the ATP Participant shall provide documentation establishing such average of the full fare economy class rates to support its reimbursement claim.

(ii) In limited circumstances, the ATP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate (*i.e.,* a premium class rate other than the first class rate) upon prior written approval by the CCC. Such circumstances are:

(A) Regularly scheduled flights between origin and destination points do not offer economy class (or equivalent) airfare and the ATP Participant receives written documentation from its travel agent to that effect at the time the tickets are purchased;

(B) Business class air travel is necessary to accommodate an eligible traveler's disability. Such disability must be substantiated in writing by a physician; and

(C) If an eligible traveler is an employee, contractor, or member of an ATP participant organization, and the eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time, ending with the scheduled arrival time, and including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds 14 hours. In such case, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (*e.g.,* weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival.

(D) If an eligible traveler is the target of a market development activity (*e.g.,* a foreign buyer, foreign importer, member of the foreign media) the ATP Participant may be reimbursed for air travel up to the business class rate when the eligible traveler's origin and/or destination are outside of the continental United States and the scheduled flight time, beginning with the scheduled departure time, ending with the scheduled arrival time, and including stopovers and changes of planes, exceeds five hours. In such case, per diem and other allowable expenses will also be reimbursable for the day of arrival. However, no expenses will be reimbursable for a rest period or for any non-work days (*e.g.,* weekends, holidays, personal leave, etc.) immediately following the date of arrival.

(iii) Alternatively, in lieu of reimbursing up to the business class rate in such circumstances noted in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)(C) and (d) of this section, the CCC will reimburse economy class airfare plus per diem and other allowable travel expenses related to a rest period of up to 24 hours, either en route or upon arrival at the destination. For a trip with multiple destinations, each origin/destination combination will be considered separately when applying the 14-hour rule for eligibility of reimbursement of business class travel or rest period expenses.

(iv) A stopover for purposes of this paragraph (c)(2) is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, which is a normally scheduled part of a flight. A change of planes is the time a traveler spends at an airport, other than the originating or destination airport, to disembark from one flight and embark on another.

(v) All travel under this paragraph (c)(2) should follow a direct or usually traveled route. Under no circumstances should a traveler select flights in a manner that extends the scheduled flight time to beyond 14 hours in part to secure eligibility for reimbursement of business class travel. An eligible traveler that is the target of a market development activity is only eligible for a rest period when that traveler flies in economy class and meets the 14-hour test;

(3) Automobile mileage at the local U.S. Embassy rate or rental cars while in travel status;

(4) Other allowable expenditures while in travel status as authorized by the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200;

(5) Accident liability insurance premiums for facilities used jointly with third-party participants for ATP activities or for ATP-funded travel of third-party participants;

(6) Market research, including research to determine the types of products that are desired in a market;

(7) Legal fees incurred in resolving trade issues with foreign countries;

(8) The sample purchase price, and the cost of transporting samples domestically in the United States to the port of export and then to the first foreign port or first point of entry, for samples of U.S. agricultural commodities used to provide on-site technical assistance to the trade necessary to facilitate successful use of the relevant U.S. agricultural commodity by importers. The target of such activity must be the trade, and not consumers, but any product resulting from the technical training can be used to determine consumer preferences;

(9) STRE incurred outside of the United States and STRE incurred within the United States in conjunction with an approved activity where the STRE has a programmatic purpose and are authorized with prior written approval from the CCC. ATP Participants are required to use the appropriate American Embassy representational funding guidelines for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and receptions incurred outside of the United States as the basis for their calculating eligible expenses. ATP Participants may exceed Embassy guidelines by 25 percent without prior approval. ATP Participants may only exceed 125 percent of Embassy guidelines when they have received written authorization from the FAS Agricultural Counselor at the Embassy. The amount of unauthorized STRE expenses that exceed 125 percent of the guidelines will not be reimbursed. ATP Participants must pay the difference between the total cost of STRE events and the appropriate amount as determined by the guidelines and these regulations. For STRE incurred in the United States, the ATP Participant should provide, in its request for approval, the basis for determining its proposed expenses;

(10) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses, incurred specifically to administer the ATP, for the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the SRTGs, and the Intertribal Agriculture Council. The level of such funding will be established in the approval letter.

(11) U.S. office(s) administrative support expenses, incurred specifically to administer the ATP, for any ATP Participants not identified in this paragraph (c)(11), will be considered, except for agricultural cooperatives. Reimbursement for such expenses shall not exceed six percent of the ATP Participant's total ATP budget. The level of such funding will be established in the approval letter.

(13) Non-travel expenditures associated with conducting international staff conferences held either in or outside the United States;

(14) Subject to paragraph (b)(18) of this section, domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for international retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows conducted in the United States upon prior written approval by CCC. Domestic travel expenses to such a show or exhibit are covered only if the exhibit or show is: A food or agricultural show with no less than 30 percent of exhibitors selling food or agricultural products; and an international show that targets buyers, distributors and the like from more than one foreign country and no less than 15 percent of its visitors are from countries other than the host country. CCC will compile a list of approved retail, trade and consumer exhibits and shows held inside the United States for which ATP reimbursement is available and such list will be announced to ATP Participants via an ATP notice issued on FAS' website;

(15) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for seminars and educational training conducted in the United States;

(16) Domestic travel expenditures, as allowed under the U.S. Federal Travel Regulations (41 CFR parts 301 through 304) and 2 CFR part 200, for up to two individuals, whether home office ATP Participant employees, ATP Participant board members, or state department of agriculture employees paid by the ATP Participant, or a combination thereof, when such individuals accompany foreign trade missions or technical teams while traveling in the United States where the following conditions are met:

(i) Such trade missions or technical team visits are identified in the ATP Participant's UES;

(ii) Such trade missions or technical team visits have been approved by CCC; and

(B) Include a discernible “link” to the FAS website or an FAS overseas office website; and

(C) Have been specifically approved by the appropriate FAS division. Expenditures related to websites or portions of websites that are accessible only to an organization's members are not reimbursable.

(ii) Reimbursement claims for websites that include “members only” sections must be prorated to exclude the costs associated with those areas subject to restricted access; and

(22) Expenditures not otherwise prohibited from reimbursement that are associated with activities held in the United States or abroad designed to improve market access by specifically addressing temporary, permanent, or impending non-tariff barriers to trade that prohibit or threaten U.S. exports of agricultural commodities. Examples of such expenditures include, but are not limited to: Initial pre-clearance programs, educational training, policy advocacy, public relations efforts, foreign country audits of U.S. facilities, export protocol and work plan support, seminars and workshops, study tours, field surveys, development of pest lists, pest and disease research, database development, and reasonable logistical and administrative support.

(d) CCC will not reimburse any cost of:
