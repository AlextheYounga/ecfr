##### ยง 1484.22 How are Cooperator program funds allocated? #####

After determining which applications to recommend for approval, the Commodity Divisions recommend funding levels for the approved applicants within their respective divisions. Applications then compete for funds on the basis of the following allocation criteria (the number in parentheses represents a percentage weight factor). Data used in the calculations for contribution levels, past export performance and past demand expansion performance will cover not more than a 6-year period, to the extent such data is available. The method for applying the following criteria will be described in the Cooperator program announcement in the Federal Register:

(a) Contribution Level (40%).

(b) Past Export Performance (20%).

(c) Past Demand Expansion Performance (20%).

(d) Future Demand Expansion Goals (10%).

(e) Accuracy of Past Demand Expansion Projections (10%).
