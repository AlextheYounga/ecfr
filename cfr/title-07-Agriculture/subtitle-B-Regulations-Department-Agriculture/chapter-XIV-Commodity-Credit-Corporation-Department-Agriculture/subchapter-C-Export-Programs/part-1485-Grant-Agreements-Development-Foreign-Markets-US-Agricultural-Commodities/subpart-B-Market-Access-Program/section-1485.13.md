Applicants are encouraged to submit a UES through the UES Internet Web site, but are not required to do so. Applicants may apply to conduct a generic promotion program and/or a brand promotion program that provides MAP funds to brand participants for branded promotion. An applicant who is a U.S. agricultural cooperative may also apply for funds to conduct its own brand promotion program.

(2) Program justification.

(i) All applications shall contain:

(A) A description of the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity(s), its harmonized tariff classification, the applicable commodity aggregate code (available from the UES Web site) and the percentage of U.S. origin content by weight, exclusive of added water;

(B) A description of the anticipated supply and demand situation for the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity(s);

(C) The volume and value of exports of the promoted U.S. agricultural commodity(s) to the targeted markets for the most recent 3-year period;

(D) If the proposal is for 2 or more years, an explanation why the proposal should be funded on a multi-year basis; and

(E) A certification and, if requested by CCC, a written explanation supporting the certification that any funds received will supplement, but not supplant, any private or third-party funds or other contributions to program activities. An explanation, if one is requested, shall indicate why the applicant is unlikely to carry out the activities without Federal financial assistance. In determining whether Federal funds would supplement or supplant private or third-party funds or contributions, CCC will consider the applicant's prior overall marketing budget in the MAP program from year-to-year, variations in promotional strategies within a country, and new markets.

(ii) [Reserved]

(3) Proposed program's strategic plan.

(i) All applications shall include a strategic plan that contains:

(A) A description of overall long term strategic goals to be advanced by the proposed activities for the ensuing 3-5 years;

(C) A description of the world market situation for the exported U.S. agricultural commodity(s);

(D) A description of competition from other exporters;

(E) An evaluation plan describing the applicant's goals and the applicant's plans for monitoring and evaluating performance towards achieving these goals. This evaluation plan should set forth specific goals and benchmarks set at regular intervals to be used to identify results against identified constraints and opportunities and to measure progress made in the target market. Evaluation of a proposed MAP program's effectiveness will depend on a clear statement by the applicant of goals, method of achievement, and expected results of programming at regular intervals. The overall goal of the MAP and of individual Participants' programming is to achieve or maintain sales that would not have occurred in the absence of MAP funding. A MAP Participant may modify and resubmit this plan for re-approval at any time during the program year.
