##### § 1499.8 Entry, handling, and labeling of donated commodities and notification requirements. #####

(a) A recipient must make all necessary arrangements for receiving the donated commodities in the target country, including obtaining appropriate approvals for entry and transit. The recipient must make arrangements with the target country government for all donated commodities that will be distributed to beneficiaries to be imported and distributed free from all customs duties, tolls, and taxes. A recipient is encouraged to make similar arrangements, where possible, with the government of a country where donated commodities to be sold or bartered are delivered.

(b) A recipient must, as provided in the agreement, arrange for transporting, storing, and distributing the donated commodities from the designated point and time where title to the donated commodities passes to the recipient.

(c) A recipient must store and maintain the donated commodities in good condition from the time of delivery at the port of entry or the point of receipt from the originating carrier until their distribution, sale or barter.

(d)(1) If a recipient arranges for the packaging or repackaging of donated commodities that are to be distributed, the recipient must ensure that the packaging:

(i) Is plainly labeled in the language of the target country;

(ii) Contains the name of the donated commodities;

(iii) Includes a statement indicating that the donated commodities are furnished by the United States Department of Agriculture; and

(iv) Includes a statement indicating that the donated commodities must not be sold, exchanged or bartered.

(2) If a recipient arranges for the processing and repackaging of donated commodities that are to be distributed, the recipient must ensure that the packaging:

(i) Is plainly labeled in the language of the target country;

(ii) Contains the name of the processed product;

(iii) Includes a statement indicating that the processed product was made with commodities furnished by the United States Department of Agriculture; and

(iv) Includes a statement indicating that the processed product must not be sold, exchanged or bartered.

(3) If a recipient distributes donated commodities that are not packaged, the recipient must display a sign at the distribution site that includes the name of the donated commodities, a statement indicating that the donated commodities are being furnished by the United States Department of Agriculture, and a statement indicating that the donated commodities must not be sold, exchanged, or bartered.

(e) A recipient must ensure that signs are displayed at all activity implementation and commodity distribution sites to inform beneficiaries that funding for the project was provided by the United States Department of Agriculture.

(f) A recipient must also ensure that all public communications relating to the project, the activities, or the donated commodities, whether made through print, broadcast, digital, or other media, include a statement acknowledging that funding was provided by the United States Department of Agriculture.

(g) CCC may waive compliance with one or more of the labeling and notification requirements in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section if a recipient demonstrates to CCC that the requirement presents a safety and security risk in the target country. If a recipient determines that compliance with a labeling or notification requirement poses an imminent threat of destruction of property, injury, or loss of life, the recipient must submit a waiver request to CCC as soon as possible. The recipient will not have to comply with such requirement during the period prior to the issuance of a waiver determination by CCC. A recipient may submit a written request for a waiver at any time after the agreement has been signed.

(h) In exceptional circumstances, CCC may, on its own initiative, waive one or more of the labeling and notification requirements in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of this section for programmatic reasons.
