(b) If a recipient has title to donated commodities that have been damaged or lost, and the value of the damaged or lost donated commodities is estimated to be in excess of $20,000, the recipient must:

(1) Notify CCC immediately and provide detailed information about the circumstances surrounding such damage or loss, the quantity of damaged or lost donated commodities, and the value of the damage or loss;

(2) Promptly upon discovery of the damage or loss, initiate a claim arising out of such damage or loss, including, if appropriate, initiating an action to collect pursuant to a commercial insurance contract;

(3) Take all necessary action to pursue the claim diligently and within any applicable periods of limitations; and

(4) Provide to CCC copies of all documentation relating to the claim.

(c) If a recipient has title to donated commodities that have been damaged or lost, and the value of the damaged or lost donated commodities is estimated to be $20,000 or less, the recipient must notify CCC in accordance with the agreement and provide detailed information about the damage or loss in the next report required to be filed under ยง 1499.13(f)(1) or (2).

(d)(1) The value of a claim for lost donated commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by CCC with respect to such commodities, as well as such costs incurred by the recipient and paid by CCC.

(2) The value of a claim for damaged donated commodities will be determined on the basis of the commodity acquisition, transportation, and related costs incurred by CCC with respect to such commodities, as well as such costs incurred by the recipient and paid by CCC, less any funds generated if such commodities are sold in accordance with ยง 1499.9(f)(1).

(e) If CCC determines that a recipient has not initiated a claim or is not exercising due diligence in the pursuit of a claim, CCC may require the recipient to assign its rights to initiate or pursue the claim to CCC.
