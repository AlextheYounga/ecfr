##### ยง 1486.400 What are the rules on cost sharing? #####

(a) The EMP is intended to complement, not supplant, the efforts of the U.S. private sector. Therefore, no private sector proposal will be considered without the element of cost-share from the participant and/or U.S. partners.

(b) There is no minimum or maximum amount of cost share. The degree of commitment to a proposed project represented by the amount and type of private funding are both used in determining which proposals will be approved. The type of cost share is also not specified, though some contributions are ineligible (ยง 1486.402 below). Cost-share may be actual cash invested or professional time of staff assigned to the project. Proposals in which the private sector is willing to commit funds, rather than in-kind items such as staff resources, and those with higher amounts of cost-share, will be given priority consideration.

(c) Cost-sharing is not required for proposals from federal, state, or local government agencies. It is mandatory from all other eligible entities, even when they are party to a joint proposal with a government agency.

(d) Contributions from federal, state, or local government agencies or programs may not be counted toward the cost share requirement. Similarly, contributions from foreign (non-U.S.) organizations may not be counted toward the cost share requirement, but may be included in the total cost of the project.

(e) An activity that is initiated by FAS, and undertaken by an entity at the request of FAS, may be exempted from the contribution requirement. This determination is made at the discretion of FAS.
