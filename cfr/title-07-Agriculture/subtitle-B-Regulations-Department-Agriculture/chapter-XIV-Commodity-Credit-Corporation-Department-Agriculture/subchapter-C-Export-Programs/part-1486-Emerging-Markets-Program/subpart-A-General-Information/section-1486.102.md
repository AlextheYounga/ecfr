##### § 1486.102 Is there a list of eligible emerging market countries? #####

The World Bank periodically redefines the income limits on upper middle-income economies. Consequently, an absolute list of “emerging market” countries has not been established. However, CCC will provide general guidance on country eligibility in each program announcement.
