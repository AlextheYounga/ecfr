##### ยง 1486.210 Are there any limits on the funding of proposals? #####

(a) The EMP is a relatively small program intended primarily to promote access to qualified emerging markets. Its funds are intended for focused projects with specific activities, rather than expansive concept papers which contain only broad ideas. Large, overly expensive projects (e.g., in excess of approximately $500,000) are rarely appropriate for the program.

(b) CCC will not reimburse 100 percent of the cost of any project undertaken by the private sector. The program is intended to provide appropriate assistance to projects which also have a significant amount of financial contributions from other sources, especially U.S. private industry.

(c) Funding for continuing and substantially similar projects is generally limited to 3 years. After that time, the project is assumed to have proven its viability and, if necessary, should be continued by the Recipient with its own or with alternative sources of funding.
