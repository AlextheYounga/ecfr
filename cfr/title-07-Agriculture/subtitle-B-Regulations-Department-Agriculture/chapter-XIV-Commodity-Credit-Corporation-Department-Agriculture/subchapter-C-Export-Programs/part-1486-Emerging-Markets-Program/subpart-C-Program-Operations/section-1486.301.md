(a) FAS will send an approval letter followed by a project agreement to each approved applicant.

The applicant is authorized to begin implementation of the project as of the date of the approval letter, unless otherwise indicated.

(b) An applicant who accepts the terms and conditions contained in the agreement should so indicate by having the appropriate authorizing official sign the agreement and submit it to the Director, Marketing Operations Staff, FAS, USDA.
