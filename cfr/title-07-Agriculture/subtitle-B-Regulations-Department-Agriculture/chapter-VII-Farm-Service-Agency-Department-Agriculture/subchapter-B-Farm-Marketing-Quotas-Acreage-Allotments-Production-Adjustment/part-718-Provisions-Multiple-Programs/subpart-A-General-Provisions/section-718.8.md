##### ยง 718.8 Administrative county. #####

(a) If all land on the farm is physically located in one county, the farm will be administratively located in that county, except as provided in the rest of this section.

(b) In cases where there is no FSA office in the county in which the farm is physically located or FSA county offices have been consolidated, the farm will be administratively located in a county contiguous to the physical county in the same State that is most convenient for the farm operator and owner.

(c) If a county contiguous to the county in which the farm is physically located in the same State does not have an FSA county office, the farm will be administratively located in a contiguous county in another contiguous State that is convenient to the farm operator and owner. Requests for changes made to administrative county under this paragraph must be made to FSA by August 1 of each year for the change to take effect that calendar year.

Paragraph (b) or (c) of this section apply if changes occur to that administrative county.

(e) The operator and owner of a farm administered in any county can request a change of administrative county to another county in the same State by August 1 for the change to take effect that calendar year. Requests for change in administrative county will be reviewed and approved by county committee if all the following can be determined to apply:

(1) The requested change does not impact the constitution of a farm;

(2) The requested change will not result in increased program eligibility or additional benefits for the farm's producers that would not be earned absent the change in administrative county being made; and

(3) The change is not to circumvent any of the provisions of other program regulations to which this part applies.
