##### ยง 760.9 Other legal recourse. #####

(a) No indemnity payment shall be made for contaminated milk resulting from residues of chemicals or toxic substances if, within 30 days after receiving a complete application, the Deputy Administrator determines that other legal recouse is available to the farmer. An application shall not be deemed complete unless it contains all information necessary to make a determination as to whether other legal recourse is available to the farmer. However, notwithstanding such a determination, the Deputy Administrator may reopen the case at a later date and make a new determination on the merits of the case as may be just and equitable.

(b) In the event that a farmer receives an indemnity payment under this subpart, and such farmer is later compensated for the same loss by the person (or the representative or successor in interest of such person) responsible for such loss, the indemnity payment shall be refunded by the farmer to the Department of Agriculture: *Provided,* That the amount of such refund shall not exceed the amount of other compensation received by the farmer.
