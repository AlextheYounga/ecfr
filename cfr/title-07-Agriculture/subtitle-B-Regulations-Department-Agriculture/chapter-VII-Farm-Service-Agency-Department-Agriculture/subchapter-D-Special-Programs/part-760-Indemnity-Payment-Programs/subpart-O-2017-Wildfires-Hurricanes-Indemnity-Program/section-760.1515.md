##### ยง 760.1515 Calculating payments for value loss crops. #####

(a) Payments made under this subpart to a participant for a loss on a unit with respect to value loss crops are determined by:

(1) Multiplying the field market value of the crop immediately before the qualifying disaster event by the *2017* WHIP factor specified in ยง 760.1511(b);

(2) Subtracting the sum of the field market value of the crop immediately after the qualifying disaster event and the value of the crop lost due to ineligible causes of loss from the result from paragraph (a)(1) of this section;

(3) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(2) of this section by the participant's share;

(4) Multiplying the result from paragraph (a)(3) of this section by the applicable payment factor;

(5) Subtracting the gross insurance indemnity or NAP payment from the result from paragraph (a)(4) of this section; and

(7) Subtracting the secondary use or salvage value of the crop from the result from paragraph (a)(5) of this section.

(b) In the case of an insurable value loss crop for which crop insurance provides for an adjustment in the guarantee, liability, or indemnity, such as in the case of inventory exceeding peak inventory value, the adjustment will be used in determining the *2017* WHIP payment for the crop.

(c) In the case of a NAP eligible value loss crop for which NAP provides for an adjustment in the level of assistance, such as in the case of unharvested field grown inventory, the adjustment will be used in determining the *2017* WHIP payment for the crop.
