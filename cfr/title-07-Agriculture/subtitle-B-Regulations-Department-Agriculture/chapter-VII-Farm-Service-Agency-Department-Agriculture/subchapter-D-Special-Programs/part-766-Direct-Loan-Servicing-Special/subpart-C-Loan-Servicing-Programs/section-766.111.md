##### § 766.111 Writedown. #####

(a) *Eligibility.* The Agency will only consider a writedown if the borrower:

(1) Meets the eligibility criteria in § 766.104;

(2) Is delinquent;

(3) Has not previously received debt forgiveness on any FLP direct loan; and

(4) Complies with the Highly Erodible Land and Wetland Conservation requirements of 7 CFR part 12.

(b) *Conditions.* (1) Rescheduling, consolidation, reamortization, deferral or some combination of these options on all of the borrower's loans would not result in a feasible plan with a 110 percent debt service margin. If a feasible plan, including writedown is achieved with a debt service margin of 101 percent or more, the Agency will determine if a feasible plan can be achieved without a writedown. If a feasible plan is achieved with and without a writedown and the borrower meets all the eligibility requirements, both options will be offered and the borrower may choose one option.

(2) The present value of the restructured loan must be greater than or equal to the net recovery value of Agency security and any non-essential assets.

(3) The writedown amount, excluding debt reduction received through Conservation Contract, does not exceed $300,000.

(4) A borrower who owns real estate must execute an SAA in accordance with § 766.201.

(c) *Associated loan servicing.* Loans written down will also be serviced in accordance with §§ 766.107 and 766.108, as appropriate.
