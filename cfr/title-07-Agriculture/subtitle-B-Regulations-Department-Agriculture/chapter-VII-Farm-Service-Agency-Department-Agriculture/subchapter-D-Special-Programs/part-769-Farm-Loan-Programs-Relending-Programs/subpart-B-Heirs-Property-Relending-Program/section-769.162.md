##### ยง 769.162 Security. #####

(a) *Loans to intermediaries.* Security pledged to the Agency by intermediaries must be sufficient to reasonably assure repayment of the loan, while taking into consideration the intermediary's financial condition, the intermediary's relending plan, and the intermediary's management ability. The Agency will require adequate security, as determined by the Agency, to fully secure the loan:

(1) Primary security for HPRP loan will be in the form of a first lien upon the intermediary's revolving loan fund and such accounts must be fully covered by Federal deposit insurance or fully collateralized with other securities in accordance with normal banking practices and all applicable State laws. The form of the control agreement with the depository bank that will be used to perfect the Agency's security interest in the depository accounts used by the intermediary to maintain HPRP funds must be approved by the Agency. The control agreement will not require the Agency's signature for withdrawals. Among other things, the intermediary must use a depository bank that agrees to waive its offset and recoupment rights against the depository account and subordinate any liens it may have against the HPRP depository account in favor of the Agency;

(2) Additional security as needed, which includes, but is not limited to:

(i) Assignments of assessments, taxes, levies, or other sources of revenue as authorized by law;

(ii) Financial assets of the intermediary and its members; and

(ii) Capital assets or other property of the intermediary and its members.

(b) *Loans to the ultimate recipient.* The intermediary is responsible for obtaining adequate security for all loans made to ultimate recipients from the HPRP revolving loan funds as specified in the HPRP loan agreement and intermediary's relending plan. The Agency will only require concurrence with the intermediary's proposed security for a loan to an ultimate recipient from the HPRP revolving loan fund if the proposed security will also serve as security for an unrelated Agency loan.
