##### § 761.205 Computing the formula allocation. #####

(a) The formula allocation for FO, CL, or OL loan funds is equal to:

(1) The amount available for allocation by the Agency minus the amounts held in the National Office reserve and distributed by base and administrative allocation, multiplied by

(2) The State Factor, which represents the percentage of the total amount of the funds for a loan program that the National Office allocates to a State Office.

formula allocation = (amount available for allocation−national reserve−base allocation−administrative allocation) × State Factor

(b) To calculate the State Factor, the Agency:

(1) Uses the following criteria, data sources, and weights:
