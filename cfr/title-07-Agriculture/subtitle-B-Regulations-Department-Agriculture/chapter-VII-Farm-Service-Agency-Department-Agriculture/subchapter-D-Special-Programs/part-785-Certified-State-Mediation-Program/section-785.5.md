##### ยง 785.5 Fees for mediation services. #####

A requirement that non-USDA parties who elect to participate in mediation pay a fee for mediation services will not preclude certification of a certified State mediation program or its eligibility for a grant; however, if participation in mediation is mandatory for a USDA agency, a certified State mediation program may not require the USDA agency to pay a fee to participate in a mediation.
