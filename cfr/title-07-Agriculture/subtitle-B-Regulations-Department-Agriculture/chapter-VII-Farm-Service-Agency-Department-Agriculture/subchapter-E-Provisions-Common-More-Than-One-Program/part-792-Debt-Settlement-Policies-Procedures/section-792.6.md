##### ยง 792.6 Collection by installment payments. #####

(a) Payments in installments may be arranged, at FSA' discretion, if a debtor furnishes satisfactory evidence of inability to pay a claim in full by the specified date. The size and frequency of installment payments shall:

(1) Bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the debtor's ability to pay; and

(2) Normally be of sufficient size and frequency to liquidate the debt in not more than three years.

(b) Except as otherwise determined by FSA, no installment arrangement will be considered unless the debtor submits a certified financial statement which reflects the debtor's assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. The financial statement shall not be required to be submitted sooner than 15 workdays following its request by FSA.

(c) All installment payment agreements shall be in writing and require the payment of interest at the late payment interest rate in effect on the date such agreement is executed, unless such interest is waived or reduced by FSA. The installment agreement shall specify all the terms of the arrangement and include provision for accelerating the debt in the event the debtor defaults.

(d) FSA may deem a repayment plan to be abrogated if the debtor fails to comply with its terms.

(e) If the debtor's financial statement or other information discloses the ownership of assets which are not encumbered, the debtor may be required to secure the payment of an installment note by executing a security agreement and financing agreement which provides FSA a security interest in the assets until the debt is paid in full.

(f) If the debtor owes more than one debt to FSA, FSA may allow the debtor to designate the manner in which a voluntary installment payment is to be applied. If the debtor does not designate the application of a voluntary installment or partial payment, the payment will be applied to such debts as determined by FSA.
