##### § 792.4 Demand for payment of debts. #####

(a) When a debt is due FSA, an initial written demand for payment of such amount shall be mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor. If the debt is not paid in full by the date specified in the initial demand letter, or if a repayment schedule acceptable to FSA has not been arranged with the debtor, the initial demand may be followed by two subsequent written demands at approximately 30-day intervals, unless it is determined by FSA that further demands would be futile and the debtor's response does not require rebuttal. The initial or subsequent demand letters shall specify the following:

(1) The basis for and the amount of the debt determined to be due FSA, including the principal, applicable interest, costs, and other charges;

(2) FSA' intent to establish an account on a debt record 30 days after the date of the letter, or other applicable period of time, if the debt is not paid within that time;

(3) The applicable late payment interest rate.

(i) If a late payment interest rate is specified in the contract, agreement or program regulation, the debtor shall be informed of that rate and the date from which the late payment interest has been accruing;

(ii) If a late payment interest rate is not specified in the contract, agreement or program regulation, the debtor shall be informed of the applicable late payment interest rate set out in § 792.10.

(4) FSA' intent, if applicable, to collect the debt 30 days from the date of the initial demand letter, or other applicable period of time, by administrative offset from any CCC or FSA payments due or to become due to the debtor, and that the claim may be reported to other agencies of the Federal government for offset from any amounts due or to become due to the debtor;

(5) FSA' intent, if applicable, under § 792.17, to report any delinquent debt to a credit reporting agency no sooner than 60 days from the date of the letter;

(6) FSA' intent, if applicable, under § 792.19, to refer any delinquent debt to the IRS, no sooner than 60 days from the date of the letter, to be considered for offset against any tax refund due or to become due the debtor.

(7) If not previously provided, the debtor's right to request administrative review by an authorized FSA official, and the proper procedure for making such request. If the request relates to the:

(i) Existence or amount of the debt, it must be made within 15 days from the date of the letter, unless a different time period is specified in the contract, agreement or program regulation;

(ii) Appropriateness of reporting to a credit reporting agency, it must be made within 30 days from the date of the letter; or

(iii) Appropriateness of referral to IRS for tax refund offset, it must be made within 60 days from the date of the letter, if applicable.

(8) The debtor's right to a full explanation of the debt and to dispute any information in the records of FSA concerning the debt;

(9) The opportunity afforded the debtor to enter into a written agreement which is acceptable to FSA for the repayment of the debt;

(10) That FSA maintains the right to initiate legal action to collect the amount of the debt;

(11) That if any portion of the debt remains unpaid or if a repayment schedule satisfactory to FSA has not been arranged 90 days after the due date, a penalty charge shall be assessed on the unpaid balance of the debt as prescribed in § 792.10(e);

(b) When FSA deems it necessary to protect the Government's interest, written demand may be preceded by other appropriate actions.
