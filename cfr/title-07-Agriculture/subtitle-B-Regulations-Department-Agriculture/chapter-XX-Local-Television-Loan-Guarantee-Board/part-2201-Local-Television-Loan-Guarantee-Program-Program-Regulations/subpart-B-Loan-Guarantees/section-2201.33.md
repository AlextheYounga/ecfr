(a) In determining, following any Payment Default or Default, whether to accelerate the maturity of any amounts outstanding under the Loan Documents or otherwise to declare such amounts to be immediately due and payable, or pursue other remedial actions available under the Loan Documents, the Agent or Lender, as the case may be, shall act at all times in accordance with the standard of care and diligence required under ยง 2201.26(a) of this part.

(b) Following any Payment Default, the Agent or Lender shall promptly notify the Board and be entitled to make a Payment Demand. Any Payment Demand shall:

(1) Identify the amount and due date of the defaulted payment of principal and the outstanding amounts of principal and interest under the Loan;

(2) Describe briefly the circumstances leading to the Payment Default, including, without limitation, the nature of any precipitating Default, whether an acceleration has occurred, and whether a bankruptcy proceeding has been instituted or threatened; and

(3) Be accompanied by a copy of each of the Loan Documents and all notices and other correspondence with the Borrower or other Lender relating to the Payment Default and any precipitating Default.

(c) Following any Payment Demand being made, the Agent or Lender shall furnish to the Board promptly upon request from the Board and, in any event, not later than ninety (90) days from the date of such request, each of the following:

(1) A written, detailed and reasonable plan for the partial or complete foreclosure on and liquidation of the Collateral, including, without limitation, detailed estimates by the Agent or Lender of the time and reasonable costs of collection anticipated to be necessary in order to carry out such plan; and

(2) A written, detailed and reasonable work-out plan, if such a plan is feasible, for the continued operation of the Borrower calculated, in the Agent's or Lender's judgment, to assure the best prospect for repayment of principal and interest under the Loan without partial or complete foreclosure and liquidation of the Collateral, including, without limitation, detailed estimates of the time and expense required for such work-out and an assessment of the risks to the Agent or Lender and the Board associated therewith relative to such risks associated with complete foreclosure and liquidation; and, if any partial foreclosure and liquidation is a part of such proposed work-out plan, a detailed estimate of the time and reasonable costs of collection anticipated by the Agent or Lender to be required to effect such partial liquidation.

(d) By making a Payment Demand, the Agent or Lender shall be conclusively deemed to have certified, with full knowledge of the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 31 U.S.C. 3729 including, without limitation, the provisions thereof for penalties and damages, to the Board that it has fully and timely complied with all material provisions and obligations under the Guarantee and the Loan Documents, that the amount demanded is past due and owed by the Borrower under the Loan Agreement, and that the demand is properly made and required to be satisfied by the Board under the terms of the Guarantee.

(e) Following receipt of any Payment Demand, the Board or, on its behalf, any duly authorized representative or designee, may conduct an audit and investigation of compliance with all material provisions and obligations under the Guarantee. The Agent and/or Lender shall cooperate fully and diligently with any such audit and investigation.

(f) Within a reasonable period of time from receipt by the Board of a Payment Demand, the Board shall approve payment of the amount to be paid in respect of the unpaid principal amount under the Loan to which the Payment Demand relates. The Board may withhold such payment if any audit or investigation is pending or if information remains to be furnished by the Agent or Lender. Further, payment shall not be made to the extent it is determined by the Board, whether as the result of an audit, investigation or otherwise, that the Board's payment obligation has terminated. Payment shall be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the bank and account designated by the Agent or Lender for such purpose.

(g) The Board may take, or direct to be taken any action in liquidating the Collateral that the Board determines to be necessary or proper, consistent with Federal law and regulations.

(h) Pursuant to the Guarantee, upon Payment Demand by the Agent or Lender, and whether the Board has approved any payment under the Guarantee or any payment has been made under the Guarantee, the Board, through the Administrator, shall have the right to liquidate, or cause to be liquidated, the Collateral. The Board, at its sole discretion, shall have the right to require that the Agent or Lender, solely or with the Administrator, conduct to completion any liquidation of any of the Collateral. Such liquidation shall be conducted by the Agent or Lender in accordance with the standards of care specified in ยง 2201.26(a) of this part.
