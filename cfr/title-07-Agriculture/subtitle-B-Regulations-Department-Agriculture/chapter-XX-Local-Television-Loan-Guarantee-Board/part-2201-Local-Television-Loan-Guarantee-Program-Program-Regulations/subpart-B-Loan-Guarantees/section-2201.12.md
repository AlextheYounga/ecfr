(a) *Eligibility.* (1) The Board will make a determination of eligibility of an Applicant to be a Borrower under the Program based upon the Applicant's ability to directly provide, as a result of financing received under the Program, Local Television Broadcast Signals to households in Nonserved Areas and/or Underserved Areas and the information provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) A determination that an Applicant is eligible does not assure that the Board will approve a Guarantee sought, or otherwise preclude the Board from declining to approve a Guarantee.

(b) *Documentation for Eligibility Determination.* (1) An Applicant must provide a Term Sheet evidencing a commitment of that Lender or Agent, and the Lenders it represents, to make a Loan to the Applicant upon an Offer of Guarantee by the Board, subject to the requirements of the Act and the regulations set forth in this part.

(2) An Applicant must provide documentation demonstrating that:

(i) The Assets, facilities, or equipment covered by the Loan will be utilized economically and efficiently;

(ii) The terms, conditions, security, and schedule and amount of repayments of principal and the payment of interest with respect to the Loan protect the financial interests of the United States and are reasonable;

(iii) Appropriate and adequate Collateral secures the Loan sought to be guaranteed;

(iv) All necessary and required regulatory and other approvals, spectrum licenses, and delivery permissions for the Loan and the Project under the Loan have been applied for or obtained (a Guarantee shall not be made and no Loan funds will be advanced until all such approvals, licenses and permissions have been obtained);

(v) The Loan would not be available on reasonable terms and conditions without a Guarantee under this Program. To satisfy this requirement, an Applicant must provide, with its application, documentation from at least one lending institution other than the Lender to which the Applicant has applied for financial assistance dated within six months of submission of the application, indicating that the Applicant was unable to obtain substantially the same Loan it is applying for on reasonable terms and conditions; and
