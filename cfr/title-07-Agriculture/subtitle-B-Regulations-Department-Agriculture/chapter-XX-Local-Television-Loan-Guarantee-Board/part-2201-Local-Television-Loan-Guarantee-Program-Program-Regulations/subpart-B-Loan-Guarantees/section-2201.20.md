##### ยง 2201.20 Collateral. #####

(a) *Existence of adequate Collateral.* An Applicant shall provide the Board such documentation as is necessary, in the judgment of the Board, to provide satisfactory evidence that appropriate and adequate Collateral secures a Loan guaranteed under the Program. Prior to approving a Guarantee, the Board shall require that the value of the Collateral pledged be at least equal to the unpaid balance of the Loan Amount.

(b) *Form of Collateral.* Collateral required by paragraph (a) of this section shall consist solely of Assets of the Applicant, any Affiliate of the Applicant, or both, as identified in the Loan Documents, including primary Assets to be used in the delivery of the service for which the Loan is guaranteed. Such Assets may include, but are not limited to, the following:

(1) Tangible Assets, including current Assets (such as cash, accounts receivable, and inventory), reserve funds, land, buildings, machinery, fixtures, and equipment;

(2) Assignments of all relevant contractual agreements, including contractual rights to certain cash flows, marketing arrangements, third-party guarantees, insurance policies, contractors' bonds, and other agreements or rights that may be of value;

(3) All permits, governmental approvals, franchises and licenses, necessary to carry out and operate the required equipment or service; and

(4) Other Assets, which, in the judgment of the Board, possess Collateral value suitable for securing the Loan, including a pledge of all or part of the Applicant's ownership interest in the Project or company, and any after-acquired property.

(c) *Applicant's compliance findings.* An Applicant's compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section does not assure a finding of reasonable assurance of repayment, or assure the Board's Guarantee of the Loan.

(d) *Collateral for entire loan.* The same Collateral shall secure the entire Loan, including both the Guaranteed Portion and the Unguaranteed Portion.

(e) *Review of valuation.* The value of Collateral securing a Loan is subject to review and approval by the Board, and may be adjusted downward by the Board if the Board reasonably believes such adjustment is appropriate. The Board's evaluation of the proposed Collateral for the Loan will be based on several factors, including but not limited to:

(1) The expected value of the pledged Collateral in the event of defaults with specific consideration given to the residual value of Project Assets to third-parties and the liquidity of such Assets;

(2) The cash flow characteristics of the Project;

(3) The contractual characteristics of the Project to the extent Project-related agreements underpin the Project's estimated cash flows;

(4) The competitiveness of the Project's economics and the associated certainty of cash flows in the future; and

(5) The creditworthiness of any designated Affiliates(s) that provides services to the Applicant or provides any credit support.

(f) *Ongoing Collateral Assessment.* The Board shall require that the value of the Collateral shall be at all times at least equal to the unpaid balance of the Loan Amount. To ensure that the ongoing value of the Collateral is properly maintained, the Board may require the borrower to have an ongoing third-party inspection and valuation of the Collateral that is acceptable to the Board. If the Collateral value at the measurement date is less than the unpaid balance of the Loan Amount, the Borrower or its designated Affiliates(s) will be required to pledge additional acceptable Collateral to cover any deficit.

(g) *Lien on Collateral.* (1) Upon the Board's approval of a Guarantee, the Administrator shall have liens on Collateral securing the Loan, which shall be superior to all other liens on such Collateral. The value of the Collateral (based on a determination satisfactory to the Board) shall be at least equal to the unpaid balance of the Loan amount, giving significant consideration to the expected value of the Collateral in the event of defaults with specific consideration given to the residual value of the Project Assets to third-parties and the liquidity of such Assets.

(2) Both the Administrator and the Lender or Agent shall have a perfected security interest in the Collateral fully sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States and the Lenders. However, the security interest perfected by the Administrator shall ensure that the Administrator has first priority in such Collateral.
