(a) *Aggregate Value of Loans.* The aggregate value of all Loans for which Guarantees are issued under the Program, including the Unguaranteed Portions of such Loans, may not exceed $1,250,000,000.

(b) *Guarantee Percentage.* (1) A Guarantee approved by the Board may not exceed an amount equal to 80 percent of the principal amount of a Loan made to finance the acquisition, improvement, enhancement, construction, deployment, launch, or rehabilitation of the means by which Local Television Broadcast Signals are delivered to a Nonserved Area or Underserved Area;

(2) If only a portion of a Loan is meant to achieve the purposes described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the Board shall determine that portion of the Loan meant to achieve such purpose and may approve a Guarantee in an amount not exceeding 80 percent of that portion of the Loan.

(3) The portion of the Loan meant to achieve the purposes described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section will not be lowered simply because the means by which Local Television Broadcast Signals are delivered to a Nonserved Area or Underserved Area also enable either the provision of signals other than Local Television Broadcast Signals or the provision of signals to areas other than Nonserved or Underserved Areas. However, any amounts of a Loan which the Board determines will be used for separable costs not essential to funding the means by which Local Television Broadcast Signals are delivered to a Nonserved Area or Underserved Area, will be excluded from the portion of the Loan eligible for a Guarantee.

(c) *Minimum Loan Amount.* The Board will not approve a Guarantee for a Loan in an amount less than $1,000,000 (inclusive of both the Guaranteed and Unguaranteed Portions of the Loan).
