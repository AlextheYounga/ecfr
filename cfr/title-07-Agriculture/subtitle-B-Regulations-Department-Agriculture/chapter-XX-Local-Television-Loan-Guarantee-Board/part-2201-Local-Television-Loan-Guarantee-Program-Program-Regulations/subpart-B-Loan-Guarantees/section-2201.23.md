##### ยง 2201.23 Funding for the Program. #####

(a) *Costs incurred by the Government.* The Act provides funding for the costs incurred by the Government as a result of granting Guarantees under the Program. While pursuing the goals of the Act, it is the intent of the Board to minimize the cost of the Program to the Government. The Board will estimate the risk posed by the guaranteed Loans to the funds appropriated for the costs of the Guarantees under the Program and operate the Program accordingly.

(b) *Credit Risk Premium* - (1) *Establishment and approval.* The Board may establish and approve the acceptance of credit risk premiums with respect to a Guarantee under this Act in order to offset the cost, as defined in section 502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, of the Guarantee. To the extent that appropriations of budget authority are insufficient to cover the cost, as so determined, of a Guarantee, and the Board approves such a Guarantee, credit risk premiums shall be accepted from a non-Federal source on behalf of a Borrower.

(2) *Credit risk premium amount* - (i) *General.* The Board shall determine the amount of any credit risk premium to be accepted with respect to a Guarantee on the basis of:

(A) The financial and economic circumstances of the Borrower, including the amount of Collateral offered;

(B) The proposed schedule of Loan disbursements;

(C) The business plans of the Borrower;

(D) Any financial commitment from a broadcast signal provider; and

(E) The concurrence of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget as to the amount of the credit risk premium.

(ii) *Proportionality.* To the extent that appropriations of budget authority are sufficient to cover the cost, as determined under section 502(5) of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, of Guarantees, the credit risk premium with respect to each Guarantee shall be reduced proportionately.

(iii) *Payment of premiums.* Credit risk premiums under this paragraph shall be paid to an escrow account established in the Treasury, which shall accrue interest. Such interest shall be retained by the escrow account, subject to paragraph (b)(2)(iv) of this section.

(iv) *Deductions from escrow account.* If a liquidation of the Collateral occurs pursuant to ยง 2201.33(h), any shortfall between the proceeds of the liquidation net of costs and expenses relating to the liquidation, and the guarantee amount paid shall be deducted from funds in the escrow account and credited to the Administrator for payment of such shortfall. At such time as all Loans guaranteed under this Program have been repaid or otherwise satisfied in accordance with the Act and the regulations in this part, remaining funds in the escrow account, if any, shall be refunded, on a pro rata basis, to Borrowers whose Loans guaranteed under the Program were not in Payment Default or Default, or where any Payment Default or Default was cured in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents.
