(A) *Description of the environment.* The existing environmental conditions relevant to the Board's analysis determining the environmental impacts of the proposed Project should be described. The no action alternative also should be discussed;

The FONSI will include the environmental assessment or a summary of it and be available to the public from the Board. The Board shall maintain a record of these decisions, making them available to interested parties upon request. Requests should be directed to LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Board, 1400 Independence Ave., SW., Room 2919-S, Stop 1575; Washington, DC 20250-1575. Prior to a final Guarantee decision, a copy of the NEPA documentation shall be sent to the Board for consideration.

(6) *Responsibilities and procedures for preparation of an environmental impact statement.* (i) If after the environmental assessment has been completed, the Board determines that an EIS is necessary, it and other related documentation will be prepared by the Board in accordance with section 102(2)(c) of NEPA, this section, and 40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508.

If such disciplines are not present on the Board staff, appropriate use should be made of personnel of Federal, State, and local agencies, universities, non-profit organizations, or private industry.

(B) Until the Board issues a record of decision as provided in 40 CFR 1502.2 no action concerning the proposal shall be taken which would:

(*1*) Have an adverse environmental impact; or

(*2*) Limit the choice of reasonable alternatives.

(*3*) 40 CFR 1506.10 places certain limitations on the timing of Board decisions on taking “major Federal actions.” A Guarantee shall not be made before the times set forth in 40 CFR 1506.10.

(iii) A public record of decision stating what the decision was; identifying alternatives that were considered, including the environmentally preferable one(s); discussing any national considerations that entered into the decision; and summarizing a monitoring and enforcement program if applicable for mitigating the environmental effects of a proposal will be prepared. This record of decision will be prepared at the time the decision is made.
