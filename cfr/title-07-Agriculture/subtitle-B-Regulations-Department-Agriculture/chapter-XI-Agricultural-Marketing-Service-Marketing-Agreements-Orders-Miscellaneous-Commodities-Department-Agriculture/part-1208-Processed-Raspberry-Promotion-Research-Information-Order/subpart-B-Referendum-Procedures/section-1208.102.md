(a) Each eligible producer of raspberries for processing and eligible importer of processed raspberries shall be entitled to cast only one ballot in the referendum. However, each producer in a landlord/tenant relationship or a divided ownership arrangement involving totally independent entities cooperating only to process raspberries, in which more than one of the parties is a producer or importer, shall be entitled to cast one ballot in the referendum covering only such producer or importer's share of the ownership.

(b) Proxy voting is not authorized, but an officer or employee of an eligible corporate producer or importer, or an administrator, executor, or trustee or an eligible entity may cast a ballot on behalf of such entity. Any individual so voting in a referendum shall certify that such individual is an officer or employee of the eligible entity, or an administrator, executive, or trustee of an eligible entity and that such individual has the authority to take such action. Upon request of the referendum agent, the individual shall submit adequate evidence of such authority.

(c) All ballots are to be cast by mail as instructed by the Department.
