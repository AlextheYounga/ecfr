##### § 1208.53 Exemption and reimbursement procedures. #####

(a) Any producer who produces less than 20,000 pounds of raspberries for processing annually who desires to claim an exemption from assessments during a fiscal year as provided in § 1208.52 shall apply to the Council, on a form provided by the Council, for a certificate of exemption. Such producer shall certify that the producer's production of raspberries for processing shall be less than 20,000 pounds for the fiscal year for which the exemption is claimed. Any importer who imports less than 20,000 pounds of processed raspberries annually who desires to claim an exemption from assessments during a fiscal year as provided in § 1208.52 shall apply to the Council, on a form provided by the Council, for a certificate of exemption. Such importer shall certify that the importer's importation of processed raspberries shall not exceed 20,000 pounds, for the fiscal year for which the exemption is claimed. If a producer or importer determines at the end of the year that they did not meet the 20,000 pounds minimum, the producer or importer can request a reimbursement on the assessments paid to the Council by 60 days of the last day of the year. If, after a person has been exempt from paying assessments for any year pursuant to this section, and the person no longer meets the requirements of paragraph of this section for an exemption, the person shall file a report with the Council in the form and manner prescribed by the Council and pay an assessment on or before March 15 of the subsequent year on all raspberries for processing produced or processed raspberries imported by such persons during the year for which the person claimed the exemption.

(b) On receipt of an application, the Council shall determine whether an exemption may be granted. The Council will then issue, if deemed appropriate, a certificate of exemption to the producer or importer which is eligible to receive one. Each producer who is exempt from assessment must provide an exemption number as supplied by the Council to the first handler in order to be exempt from the collection of an assessment on raspberries for processing. First handlers shall maintain records showing the exemptee's name and address along with the exemption number assigned by the Council.

(c) Importers who are eligible for reimbursement of assessments collected by Customs shall apply to the Council for reimbursement of such assessments paid. No interest will be paid on assessments collected by Customs. Requests for reimbursement shall be submitted within 60 days of the last day of the year the processed raspberries were actually imported. Any claim for reimbursement submitted after sixty (60) days will be considered null and void.

(d) *Organic exemption.* (1) A producer of raspberries for processing who operates under an approved National Organic Program (7 CFR part 205) (NOP) organic production system plan may be exempt from the payment of assessments under this part, provided that:

(i) Only agricultural products certified as “organic” or “100 percent organic” (as defined in the NOP) are eligible for exemption;

(ii) The exemption shall apply to all certified “organic” or “100 percent organic” (as defined in the NOP) products of a producer regardless of whether the agricultural commodity subject to the exemption is produced by a person that also produces conventional or nonorganic agricultural products of the same agricultural commodity as that for which the exemption is claimed;

(iii) The producer maintains a valid certificate of organic operation as issued under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6501-6522) (OFPA) and the NOP regulations issued under OFPA (7 CFR part 205); and

(iv) Any producer so exempted shall continue to be obligated to pay assessments under this part that are associated with any agricultural products that do not qualify for an exemption under this section.

(2) To apply for exemption under this section, an eligible producer shall submit a request to the Council on an *Organic Exemption Request Form* (Form AMS-15) at any time during the year initially, and annually thereafter on or before the beginning of the fiscal period, for as long as the producer continues to be eligible for the exemption.

(3) A producer request for exemption shall include the following:

(i) The applicant's full name, company name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address;

(ii) Certification that the applicant maintains a valid certificate of organic operation issued under the OFPA and the NOP;

(iii) Certification that the applicant produces organic products eligible to be labeled “organic” or “100 percent organic” under the NOP;

(iv) A requirement that the applicant attach a copy of their certificate of organic operation provided by a USDA-accredited certifying agent under the OFPA and the NOP;

(v) Certification, as evidenced by signature and date, that all information provided by the applicant is true; and

(vi) Such other information as may be required by the Council, with the approval of the Secretary.

(4) If a producer complies with the requirements of this section, the Council will grant an assessment exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the producer within 30 days. If the application is disapproved, the Council will notify the applicant of the reason(s) for disapproval within the same timeframe.

(5) An importer who imports products that are eligible to be labeled as “organic” or “100 percent organic” under the NOP, or certified as “organic” or “100 percent organic” under a U.S. equivalency arrangement established under the NOP, may be exempt from the payment of assessments on those products. Such importer may submit documentation to the Council and request an exemption from assessment on certified “organic” or “100 percent organic” processed raspberries on an *Organic Exemption Request Form* (Form AMS-15) at any time initially, and annually thereafter on or before the beginning of the fiscal period, as long as the importer continues to be eligible for the exemption. This documentation shall include the same information required of a producer in paragraph (d)(3) of this section. If the importer complies with the requirements of this section, the Council will grant the exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the importer within the applicable timeframe. If Customs collects the assessment on exempt product that is identified as “organic” by a number in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, the Council must reimburse the exempt importer the assessments paid upon receipt of such assessments from Customs. For all other exempt organic product for which Customs collects the assessment, the importer may apply to the Council for a reimbursement of assessments paid, and the importer must submit satisfactory proof to the Council that the importer paid the assessment on exempt organic product. Any importer so exempted shall continue to be obligated to pay assessments under this part that are associated with any imported agricultural products that do not qualify for an exemption under this section.

(e) Any person who desires an exemption from assessments for a subsequent fiscal year shall reapply to the Council, on a form provided by the Council, for a certificate of exemption.

(f) The Council, with the Secretary's approval, may request that persons claiming an exemption from assessments under § 1208.53 must provide it with any information it deems necessary about the exemption, including, without limitation, the disposition of the exempted commodity.

(g) The exemption will apply immediately following the issuance of the certificate of exemption.
