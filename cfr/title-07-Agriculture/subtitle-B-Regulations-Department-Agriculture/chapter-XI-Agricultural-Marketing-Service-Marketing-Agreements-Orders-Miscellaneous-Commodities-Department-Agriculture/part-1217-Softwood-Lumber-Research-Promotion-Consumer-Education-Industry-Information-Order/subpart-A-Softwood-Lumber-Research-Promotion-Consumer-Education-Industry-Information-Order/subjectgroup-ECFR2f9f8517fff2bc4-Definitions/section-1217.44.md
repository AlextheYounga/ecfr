Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 50300, Sept. 25, 2019.

(a) A majority of the Board members (10) will constitute a quorum so long as at least three of the members present are importer members and six of the members present are domestic manufacturers. If participation by telephone or other means is permitted, members participating by such means shall count as present in determining quorum or other voting requirements set forth in this section.

(b) All votes at meetings of the Board and executive committee will be cast in person or by electronic voting or other means as the Board and Secretary deem appropriate to allow members participating by telephone or other electronic means to cast votes. Voting by proxy will not be allowed.

(c) Each member of the Board will be entitled to one vote on any matter put to the Board and the motion will carry if supported by 10 Board members, except for recommendations to change the assessment rate or to adopt a budget, both of which require affirmation by at least two-thirds (12 members for an 18 member Board and 13 members for a 19 member Board) of the Board members. If a Board has vacant positions, recommendations to change the assessment rate or to adopt a budget must pass by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Board members, exclusive of the vacant seats.

(d) The Board must give members and the Secretary timely notice of all Board, executive and committee meetings.

(e) In lieu of voting at a properly convened meeting, and when, in the opinion of the Board's chairperson, such action is considered necessary, the Board may take action by mail, telephone, electronic mail, facsimile, or any other means of communication. Any action taken under this procedure is valid only if:

(1) All members and the Secretary are notified and the members are provided the opportunity to vote;

(2) Ten (10) Board members vote in favor of the action (unless two-thirds vote of the Board members is required under the Order); and

(3) All votes are promptly confirmed in writing and recorded in the Board minutes.
