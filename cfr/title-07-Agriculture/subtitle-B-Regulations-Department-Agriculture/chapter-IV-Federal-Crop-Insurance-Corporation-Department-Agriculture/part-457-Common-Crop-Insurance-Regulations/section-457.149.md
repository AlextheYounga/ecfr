(2) Twenty-one (21) pounds in all other California districts.

(3) Or as otherwise specified in the Special Provisions.

*Set out.* Physically planting the grape plants in the vineyard.

*Table grapes.* Grapes that are grown for commercial sale for human consumption as fresh fruit on acreage where the cultural practices to produce fresh marketable grapes are carried out.

*Type.* A category of grapes (one or more varieties) identified as a type in the Special Provisions.

*USDA* g*rade standard.* (1) United States standard used to determine the minimum quality grade will be:

(ii) The United States Standards for Grades of American (Eastern Type Bunch Grapes); and

(iii) The United States Standards for Grades of Muscadine (*Vitis rotundifolia*) Grapes.

(2) The quantity and number of samples required will be determined in accordance with procedure issued by FCIC or as provided on the Special Provisions of Insurance.

*Variety.* A kind of grape that is distinguished from any other by unique characteristics such as, but not limited to, size, color, skin thickness, acidity, flavors and aromas. In Arizona and California each variety is identified as a separate type in the Special Provisions except for type 095 (other varieties). Type 095 is used to designate varieties not listed as a separate type.

2. Unit Division

(a) In Arizona and California only:

(1) A basic unit as defined in section 1 of the Basic Provisions will be divided into additional basic units by each table grape variety that you insure; and

(2) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that provide for optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Unless otherwise allowed by written agreement, optional units may only be established if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land or grown and insured under an organic farming practice.

(b) In all states except Arizona and California, in addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm number and by irrigated and non-irrigated acreage and for acreage grown and insured under an organic farming practice as provided in the unit division provisions contained in the Basic Provisions, a separate optional unit may be established if each optional unit:

(1) Is located on non-contiguous land; or

(2) Consists of a separate type when separate types are specified in the Special Provisions.

3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices

In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:

(a) In Arizona and California, you may select only one coverage level and price election for each table grape variety you elect to insure in the county.

(b) In all states except Arizona and California, you may select only one coverage level and price election for each table grape type in the county as specified in the Special Provisions. The coverage level you choose for each table grape type is not required to have same percentage relationship. The price election you choose for each type is not required to have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price election offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 75 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you may choose 65 percent coverage level and 75 percent of the maximum price election for another type. If you elect the Catastrophic Risk Protection (CAT) level of insurance for any grape type, the CAT level of coverage will be applicable to all insured grape acreage in the county.

(c) In all states except Arizona and California, if you acquire a share in any grape acreage after you submit your application, such acreage is insurable under the terms of the policy and you did not include the grape type on your application, we will assign the following:

(1) A coverage level equal to the lowest coverage level you selected for any other grape type: and

(2) A price election percentage equal to the type with the lowest coverage level you selected, if you elected additional coverage; or 55 percent of the maximum price election, if you elected CAT.

(d) You must report by the production reporting date designated in section 3 of the Basic Provisions, by type or variety if applicable:

(1) Any damage, removal of bearing vines, change in practices or any other circumstance that may reduce the expected yield below the yield upon which the insurance guarantee is based, and the number of affected acres;

(2) The number of bearing vines on insurable and uninsurable acreage;

(3) The age of the vines and the planting pattern; and

(4) For the first year of insurance for acreage interplanted with another perennial crop, and any time the planting pattern of such acreage is changed:

(i) The age of the interplanted crop, and the table grape type or variety, if applicable;

(ii) The planting pattern; and

(iii) Any other information that we request in order to establish your approved yield.

(e) We will reduce the yield used to establish your production guarantee, based on our estimate of the effect on yield potential of any of the items listed in section 3(d)(1) through (4). If you fail to notify us of any circumstance that may reduce your yields from previous levels, we will reduce your production guarantee at any time we become aware of the circumstance.

(f) Your request to increase the coverage level or price election percentage will not be accepted if a cause of loss that could or would reduce the yield of the insured crop is evident when your request is made.

4. Contract Changes

In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is October 31 preceding the cancellation date for Arizona and California and August 31 preceding the cancellation date for all other states.

5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the cancellation and termination dates are January 31 in Arizona and California, and November 20 for all other states.

6. Report of Acreage

In addition to the requirements of section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must report your acreage:

(a) In Arizona and California, by each table grape variety you insure; or

(b) In all other states, by each table grape type.

7. Insured Crop

In accordance with section 8 of the Basic Provisions, the crop insured will be any insurable variety of table grapes that you elect to insure in Arizona and California, or in all other states all insurable types, in the county for which a premium rate is provided by the actuarial documents:

(a) In which you have a share;

(b) That are grown for harvest as table grapes;

(c) That are adapted to the area;

(d) That are grown in a vineyard that, if inspected, is considered acceptable by us;

(e) That, after being set out or grafted, have reached the number of leaf years designated by the Special Provisions; and

(f) That have produced an average of at least 150 lugs of table grapes per acre in at least one of the three crop years immediately preceding the insured crop year, unless otherwise allowed by the Special Provisions.

8. Insurable Acreage

In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop, table grapes interplanted with another perennial crop are insurable unless we inspect the acreage and determine that it does not meet the requirements contained in your policy.

9. Insurance Period

(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions

(1) For the year of application, coverage begins on February 1 in Arizona and California, and November 21 in all other states. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if your application is received by us after January 12 but prior to February 1 in Arizona or California, or after November 1 but prior to November 21 in all other states, insurance will attach on the 20th day after your properly completed application is received in our local office, unless we inspect the acreage during the 20-day period and determine that it does not meet insurability requirements. You must provide any information that we require for the crop or to determine the condition of the vineyard.

(2) For each subsequent crop year that the policy remains continuously in force, coverage begins on the day immediately following the end of the insurance period for the prior crop year. Policy cancellation that results solely from transferring to a different insurance provider for a subsequent crop year will not be considered a break in continuous coverage.

(3) If in accordance with the terms of the policy, your table grape policy is cancelled or terminated for any crop year after insurance attached for that crop year, but on or before the cancellation and termination dates, whichever is later, insurance will not be considered to have attached for that crop year and no premium, administrative fee, or indemnity will be due for such crop year.

(4) The calendar date for the end of insurance period for each crop year is the date specified in the Special Provisions.

(b) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of the Basic Provisions:

(1) If you acquire an insurable share in any insurable acreage after coverage begins, but on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, and after an inspection we consider the acreage acceptable; insurance will be considered to have attached to such acreage on the calendar date for the beginning of the insurance period. Acreage acquired after the acreage reporting date will not be insured.

(2) If you relinquish your insurable share on any insurable acreage of table grapes on or before the acreage reporting date for the crop year, insurance will not be considered to have attached to, and no premium will be due or indemnity paid for such acreage for that crop year unless:

(i) A transfer of coverage and right to an indemnity, or a similar form approved by us, is completed by all affected parties;

(ii) We are notified by you or the transferee in writing of such transfer on or before the acreage reporting date; and

(iii) The transferee is eligible for crop insurance.

10. Causes of Loss

(a) In accordance with the provisions of section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:

(1) Adverse weather conditions;

(2) Fire, unless weeds and other forms of undergrowth have not been controlled or pruning debris has not been removed from the vineyard;

(3) Insects, except as excluded in 10(b)(1), but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;

(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;

(5) Wildlife;

(6) Earthquake;

(7) Volcanic eruption; or

(8) Failure of irrigation water supply, if caused by an insured peril that occurs during the insurance period.

(b) In addition to the causes of loss excluded in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against damage or loss of production due to:

(1) Phylloxera, regardless of cause; or

(2) Inability to market the table grapes for any reason other than the actual physical damage from an insurable cause specified in this section. For example, we will not pay you an indemnity if you are unable to market due to quarantine, boycott, or refusal of any person to accept production.

11. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

In addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, the following will apply:

(a) You must notify us within 3 days after the date harvest should have started if the crop will not be harvested.

(b) If any portion of your crop will be direct marketed, you must notify us at least 15 calendar days before any production will be harvested. We will conduct an appraisal that will be used to determine your production to count for production that is sold by direct marketing. If damage occurs after this appraisal, we will conduct an additional appraisal. These appraisals, and any acceptable records provided by you, will be used to determine your production to count. Failure to give timely notice that production will be harvested for direct marketing will result in an appraised amount of production to count of not less than the production guarantee per acre if such failure results in our inability to make the required appraisal.

(c) If the crop has been damaged during the growing season and you previously gave notice in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions, you must also provide notice at least 15 days prior to the beginning of harvest if you intend to claim an indemnity as a result of the damage previously reported. You must not destroy the damaged crop until the earlier of 15 days from the date you gave notice of loss, or our written consent to do so. If you fail to meet requirements of this section all such production will be considered undamaged and included as production to count.

12. Settlement of Claim

(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide separate acceptable production records:

(1) For any optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or

(2) For any basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.

(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:

(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;

(2) Multiplying each result in section 12(b)(1) by the respective price election you selected for each type or variety;

(3) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(2);

(4) Multiplying the total production to count of each type or variety, if applicable, (see section 12(c)) by the respective price election you selected;

(5) Totaling the results in section 12(b)(4);

(6) Subtracting the result of section 12(b)(5) from the result in section 12(b)(3); and

(7) Multiplying the result of section 12(b)(6) by your share.

(c) The total production to count (in lugs) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:

(1) All appraised production as follows:

(i) Not less than the production guarantee per acre for acreage:

(A) That is abandoned;

(B) That is sold by direct marketing if you fail to meet the requirements in section 11(b);

(C) That is damaged solely by uninsured causes; or

(D) For which you fail to provide acceptable production records;

(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;

(iii) Unharvested production that meets, or would meet if properly handled, the state quality standards, if specified in the Special Provisions, or the appropriate USDA grade standard (if no state standard is specified); and

(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to abandon or no longer care for, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end. If you do not agree with our appraisal, we may defer the claim only if you agree to continue to care for the crop. We will then make another appraisal when you notify us of further damage or that harvest is general in the area unless you harvested the crop, in which case we will use the harvested production. If you do not continue to care for the crop, our appraisal made prior to deferring the claim will be used to determine the production to count; and

(2) All harvested production from insurable acreage regardless of condition or disposition. The quantity of production to count for table grape production damaged by insurable causes within the insurance period that is marketed for any use other than table grapes will be determined by multiplying the greater of (1) the value of the table grapes per ton or (2) $50, by the number of tons and dividing that result by the highest price election available for the insured unit. This result will be the number of lugs to count.

13. Late and Prevented Planting

The late and prevented planting provisions of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.
