(1) In which you have a share;

(2) That is planted for harvest as grain; and

(3) That is grown in man-made flood irrigated fields.

(b) Section 8(b)(3) of the Basic Provisions is not applicable to the cultivated wild rice seed that naturally shatters and is subsequently mechanically incorporated into the soil.

7. Insurance Period

In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, the calendar date for the end of the insurance period is:

(a) For Minnesota, September 30 of the calendar year the crop is normally harvested;

(b) For California, October 15 of the calendar year the crop is normally harvested; and

(c) For all other states, the date provided in the Special Provisions.

8. Causes of Loss

(a) In accordance with section 12 of the Basic Provisions, insurance is provided only against the following causes of loss that occur during the insurance period:

(1) Adverse weather conditions;

(2) Fire;

(3) Insects, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;

(4) Plant disease, but not damage due to insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;

(5) Wildlife;

(6) Earthquake;

(7) Volcanic eruption; or

(8) Failure of the irrigation water supply, if caused by a cause of loss specified in sections 8(a)(1) through (7) that occurs during the insurance period, drought, or the intrusion of saline water.

(b) In addition to the causes not insured against in section 12 of the Basic Provisions, we will not insure against any loss of production due to:

(1) The crop not being timely harvested unless such delay in harvesting is solely and directly due to adverse weather conditions which preclude harvesting equipment from entering and moving about the field; or

(2) The application of saline water, except as specified in section 8(a) of these crop provisions.

9. Replanting Payments

The provisions of section 13 of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.

10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.

11. Settlement of Claim

(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:

(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which such production records were not provided; or

(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.

(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:

(1) Multiplying the insured acreage by its respective production guarantee;

(2) Multiplying the result in section 11(b)(1) by the respective price election;

(3) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(2);

(4) Multiplying the total production to be counted, (see section 11(c) through (d)) by the respective price election;

(5) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(4);

(6) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(5) from the result of section 11(b)(3); and

(7) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(6) by your share.

For example:

You have a 100 percent share in 100 acres of cultivated wild rice in the unit, with a guarantee of 400 pounds per acre and a price election of $1.00 per pound. You are only able to harvest 20,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:

(1) 100 acres × 400 pounds = 40,000 pound guarantee;

(2) 40,000 pounds × $1.00 per pound price election = $40,000 value of guarantee;

(3) 20,000 pounds × $1.00 per pound price election = $20,000 value of production to count;

(4) $40,000 − $20,000 = $20,000 loss; and

(5) $20,000 × 100 percent share = $20,000 indemnity payment.

(c) The total production to count (finished weight) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:

(1) All appraised production as follows:

(i) Not less than the production guarantee for acreage:

(A) That is abandoned;

(B) Put to another use without our consent;

(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or

(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us;

(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;

(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested green weight production must be adjusted in accordance with section 11(d)); and

(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:

(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or

(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and

(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.

(d) Mature green weight will be multiplied by the recovery percentage subject to the following:

(1) We may obtain samples of the production to determine the recovery percentage.

(2) The determined recovery percentage will be used to calculate your loss only if:

(i) All determined recovery percentages are established using samples of green weight production obtained by us or by the processor for sold or processed production; and

(ii) The samples are analyzed by an approved laboratory.

(3) If the conditions of section 11(d)(2) are not met, the standard recovery percentage will be used.

12. Late Planting

The provisions of section 16 of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.

13. Prevented Planting

The provisions of section 17 of the Basic Provisions are not applicable.
