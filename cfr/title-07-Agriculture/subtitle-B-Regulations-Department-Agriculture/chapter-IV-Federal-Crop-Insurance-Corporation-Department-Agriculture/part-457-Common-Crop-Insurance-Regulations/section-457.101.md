##### § 457.101 Small grains crop insurance provisions. #####

The Small Grains Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2022 and succeeding crop years are as follows:

United States Department of AgricultureFederal Crop Insurance CorporationSmall Grains Crop Provisions1. Definitions

*Adequate stand.* A population of live plants per unit of acreage which will produce at least the yield used to establish your production guarantee.

*Harvest.* Combining or threshing the insured crop for grain or cutting for hay or silage on any acreage. A crop which is swathed prior to combining is not considered harvested.

*Initially planted.* The first occurrence of planting the insured crop on insurable acreage for the crop year.

*Khorasan.* The common name for a variety of wheat (*Triticum turanicum*) that is marketed under trademarks such as Kamut. Khorasan is considered spring wheat for the purposes of this policy.

*Latest final planting date.* (a) The final planting date for the spring type in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring type only;

(b) The final planting date for the winter type in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate a winter type only; or

(c) The final planting date for the spring type in all counties for which the Special Provisions designate both spring and winter types.

*Local market price.* The cash grain price per bushel for the applicable quality level indicated below and offered by buyers in the area in which you normally market the insured crop. The local market price will reflect the maximum limits of quality deficiencies allowable for the applicable quality level indicated below. Factors not associated with the specified quality levels, including but not limited to protein, oil or moisture content, or milling quality will not be considered.

(1) U.S. No. 2 for Wheat (subclass hard amber durum for durum wheat and subclass northern spring for hard red spring wheat), except Khorasan; barley (including hull-less barley); oats (including hull-less oats); rye; and flax.

(2) The quality factor levels required for durum wheat to grade U.S. No. 2 for Khorasan.

(3) No. 2 grade buckwheat determined in accordance with the applicable state grading standards.

*Nurse crop* (companion crop). A crop planted into the same acreage as another crop, that is intended to be harvested separately, and which is planted to improve growing conditions for the crop with which it is grown.

*Planted acreage.* In addition to the definition contained in the Basic Provisions, except for flax, land on which seed is initially spread onto the soil surface by any method and subsequently is mechanically incorporated into the soil in a timely manner and at the proper depth will be considered planted. Flax seed must initially be planted in rows to be considered planted, unless otherwise provided by the Special Provisions, actuarial documents, or by written agreement.

*Prevented planting.* As defined in the Basic Provisions, except that the references to “final planting date” contained in the definition in the Basic Provisions are replaced with the “latest final planting date.”

*Small grains.* Wheat, including only common wheat (*Triticum aestivum*), club wheat (*T. compactum*), durum wheat (*T. durum*) and Khorasan (*T. turanicum*); barley (*Hordeum vulgare*), including hull-less barley and excluding black barley; oats (*Avena sativa,* and *A. byzantina*), and hull-less oats (*A. Nuda*); rye (*Secale cereale*); flax (*Linum usitatissimum*); and buckwheat (*Fagopyrum esculentum*) or as otherwise specified in the actuarial documents.

*Swathed.* Severance of the stem and grain head from the ground without removal of the seed from the head and placing into a windrow.

2. Unit Division.

(a) In addition to enterprise units provided in section 34(a) of the Basic Provisions, for wheat only, you may elect separate enterprise units by type, as provided in this section, if allowed by the actuarial documents. If you elect enterprise units by type, you may not elect enterprise or optional units by irrigation practices.

(1) You may elect separate enterprise units by type unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions. For example, if you have winter and spring types, you may elect one enterprise unit for the spring type or one enterprise unit for the winter type, or separate enterprise units for both types. Any acreage which is not reported and insured as an enterprise unit will be insured as basic or optional units, if requirements are met. For example, if you only have winter and spring types, you may have an enterprise unit for the winter type acreage and basic or optional units for the spring type acreage.

(2) You must separately meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4) of the Basic Provisions for each enterprise unit.

(3) If you elected separate enterprise units for multiple types and we discover enterprise unit qualifications are not separately met for all types in which you elected enterprise unit and such discovery is made:

(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, you may elect to insure:

(A) All types in which you elected an enterprise unit for meeting the requirements in section 34(a)(4) as separate enterprise units, and basic or optional units for any acreage that is not reported and insured as an enterprise unit, whichever you report on your acreage report and for which you qualify;

(B) One enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4); or

(C) Basic or optional units for all acreage of the crop in the county, whichever you report on your acreage report and for which you qualify; or

(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, your unit structure will be one enterprise unit for all acreage of the crop in the county provided you meet the requirements in section 34(a)(4). Otherwise, we will assign the basic unit structure for all acreage of the crop in the county.

(4) If you elected an enterprise unit for only one type and we discover you do not qualify for an enterprise unit for that type and such discovery is made:

(i) On or before the acreage reporting date, your unit division for all acreage of the crop in the county will be based on basic or optional units, whichever you report on your acreage report and for which you qualify; or

(ii) At any time after the acreage reporting date, we will assign the basic unit structure for all acreage of the crop in the county.

(b) In addition to, or instead of, establishing optional units as provided in section 34(c) of the Basic Provisions, for wheat only, separate optional units may be established for each wheat type (designated in actuarial documents and including any type insured by written agreement) if each optional unit contains only initially-planted acreage of the type.

3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities

In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic Provisions:

(a) Revenue protection is not available for your oats, rye, flax, or buckwheat. Therefore, if you elect to insure such crops by the sales closing date, they will only be protected against a loss in yield.

(b) Revenue protection is available for wheat and barley. Therefore, if you elect to insure your wheat or barley:

(1) You must elect to insure your wheat or barley with either revenue protection or yield protection by the sales closing date; and

(2) In counties with both winter and spring sales closing dates for the insured crop (excluding counties that have a spring sales closing date and a winter sales closing date only applicable to the Winter Coverage Endorsement):

(i) If you do not have any insurable winter-planted acreage of the insured crop, you may change your coverage level, or your percentage of projected price (if you have yield protection), or elect revenue protection or yield protection, until the spring sales closing date; or

(ii) If you have any insurable winter-planted acreage of the insured crop, you may not change your coverage level, or your percentage of projected price (if you have yield protection), or elect revenue protection or yield protection, after the winter sales closing date. Winter-planted acreage of the insured crop must be reported and insured if it meets the requirements in section 6.

4. Contract Changes

In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract change date is November 30 preceding the cancellation date for counties with a March 15 cancellation date and June 30 preceding the cancellation date for all other counties.

5. Cancellation and Termination Dates

The cancellation and termination dates are as follows, unless otherwise specified in the actuarial documents:

6. Insured Crop

(a) The crop insured will be each small grain you elect to insure, that is grown in the county on insurable acreage, and for which premium rates are provided by the actuarial documents:

(1) In which you have a share;

(2) That is planted for harvest as grain (a grain mixture in which barley or oats is the predominate grain may also be insured if allowed by the Barley or Oat Special Provisions, or if a written agreement allows insurance for such mixture. The production from such mixture will be considered as the predominate grain on a weight basis); and

(3) That is not, unless insurance is allowed by a written agreement:

(i) Interplanted with another crop except as allowed in section 6(a)(2);

(ii) Planted into an established grass or legume; or

(iii) Planted as a nurse crop, unless planted as a nurse crop for new forage seeding, but only if seeded at a normal rate and intended for harvest as grain.

(b) Buckwheat will be insured only if it is produced under a contract with a business enterprise equipped with facilities appropriate to handle and store buckwheat production. The contract must be executed by you and the business enterprise, in effect for the crop year, and a copy provided to us no later than the acreage reporting date. To be considered a contract, the executed document must contain:

(1) A requirement that you plant, grow and deliver buckwheat to the business enterprise;

(2) The amount of production that will be accepted or a statement that all production from a specified number of acres will be accepted;

(3) The price to be paid for the contracted production or a method to determine such price; and

(4) Other such terms that establish the obligations of each party to the contract.

(c) If you anticipate destroying any acreage prior to harvest you:

(1) May report all planted acreage when you report your acreage for the crop year and specify any acreage to be destroyed as uninsurable acreage (By doing so, no coverage will be considered to have attached on the specified acreage and no premium will be due for such acreage. If you do not destroy such acreage, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions); or

(2) May report all planted acreage as insurable when you report your acreage for the crop year. Premium will be due on all the acreage except as set forth herein. If the Special Provisions allow a reduced premium amount for acreage intentionally destroyed prior to harvest, you may qualify for such reduction only if you notify us in writing on or before the date designated in the Special Provisions of the intended destruction, and do not claim an indemnity on the acreage. No premium reduction will be allowed if the required notice is not given or if you claim an indemnity for the acreage. Upon receiving timely notice, insurance coverage on the acreage you do not intend to harvest will cease and we will revise your acreage report to indicate the applicable reduction in premium. If you do not destroy the crop as intended, you will be subject to the under-reporting provisions contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions.

(d) In counties for which the actuarial table provides premium rates for the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement (7 CFR 457.102), coverage is available for wheat or barley damaged between the time coverage begins and the spring final planting date. Coverage under the endorsement is effective only if you qualify under the terms of the endorsement and you execute the endorsement by the sales closing date.

7. Insurance Period

In accordance with section 11 of the Basic Provisions, and subject to any provisions provided by the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement (if elected by you):

(a) Insurance attaches on each unit or part thereof on the later of the date we accept your application or the date the insured crop is planted.

(1) For rye, flax, and buckwheat, the following limitations apply:

(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the insured crop except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the Basic Provisions.

(ii) Any acreage of the insured crop damaged before the final planting date, to the extent that producers in the surrounding area would not normally further care for the crop, must be replanted unless we agree that it is not practical to replant.

(2) For barley, oat, and wheat, the following limitations apply:

(i) The acreage must be planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions for the type (winter or spring) except as allowed in section 12 of these Crop Provisions and section 16 of the Basic Provisions.

(ii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a winter type, any acreage of winter barley, oats, or wheat damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.

(iii) Whenever the Special Provisions designate both winter and spring types:

(A) Any winter barley, oat, or wheat acreage that is damaged before the spring final planting date, to the extent that producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a winter type of the insured crop to maintain insurance based on the winter type unless we agree that replanting is not practical. If it is not practical to replant to the winter type of barley, oats, or wheat, but is practical to replant to a spring type, you must replant to a spring type to keep your insurance based on the winter type in force.

(B) Any winter barley, oat, or wheat acreage that is replanted to a spring type of the same crop when it was practical to replant the winter type will be insured as the spring type and the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price applicable to the spring type will be used. In this case, the acreage will be considered to be initially planted to the spring type.

(C) Notwithstanding sections 7(a)(2)(iii)(A) and (B), if you have elected coverage under a barley or wheat Winter Coverage Endorsement (if available in the county), insurance will be in accordance with the endorsement.

(D) Any winter barley, oat, or wheat acreage planted after the end of the late planting period will not be insured unless you request such coverage on or before the spring sales closing date, and we inspect and determine that the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee. However, if we fail to inspect the acreage by the spring final planting date, insurance will attach as specified in section 7(a)(2)(iii)(D)(*3*).

(*1*) Your request for coverage must include the location and number of acres of winter barley, oats, or wheat.

(*2*) The winter barley, oats, or wheat will be insured as a spring type for the purpose of the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price, if applicable.

(*3*) Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we do not determine adequacy of the stand by the spring final planting date.

(iv) Whenever the Special Provisions designate a spring type, any spring barley, oat, or wheat acreage damaged before such final planting date, to the extent that producers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree that replanting is not practical.

(v) Whenever the Special Provisions designate only a spring final planting date, any acreage of fall planted barley or fall planted wheat is not insured unless you request such coverage on or before the spring sales closing date, and we determine, in writing, that the acreage has an adequate stand in the spring to produce the yield used to determine your production guarantee. However, if we fail to inspect the acreage by the spring final planting date, insurance will attach as specified in section 7(a)(2)(v)(C).

(A) Your request for coverage must include the location and number of acres of fall planted barley or wheat.

(B) The fall planted barley or fall planted wheat will be insured as a spring type for the purpose of the production guarantee, premium, projected price, and harvest price, if applicable.

(C) Insurance will attach to such acreage on the date we determine an adequate stand exists or on the spring final planting date if we do not determine adequacy of the stand by the spring final planting date.

(D) Any acreage of such fall planted barley or fall planted wheat that is damaged after it is accepted for insurance but before the spring final planting date, to the extent that growers in the area would normally not further care for the crop, must be replanted to a spring type of the insured crop unless we agree it is not practical to replant.

(E) If fall planted acreage is not to be insured it must be recorded on the acreage report as uninsured fall planted acreage.

(b) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period is the following applicable date:

(1) September 25 in Alaska;

(2) July 31 in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee; or

(3) October 31 in all other states.

8. Causes of Loss

In addition to the provisions under section 12 of the Basic Provisions, any loss covered by this policy must occur within the insurance period.

The specific causes of loss for small grains are:

(a) Adverse weather conditions;

(b) Fire;

(c) Insects, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of pest control measures;

(d) Plant disease, but not damage allowed because of insufficient or improper application of disease control measures;

(e) Wildlife;

(f) Earthquake;

(g) Volcanic eruption;

(h) Failure of the irrigation water supply due to a cause of loss specified in sections 8(a) through (g) that also occurs during the insurance period; or

(i) For revenue protection, a change in the harvest price from the projected price, unless FCIC can prove the price change was the direct result of an uninsured cause of loss specified in section 12(a) of the Basic Provisions.

9. Replanting Payments

(a) A replanting payment is allowed as follows:

(1) In lieu of provisions in section 13 of the Basic Provisions that limit the amount of a replant payment to the actual cost of replanting, the amount of any replanting payment will be determined in accordance with these crop provisions;

(2) You must comply with all requirements regarding replanting payments contained in section 13 of the Basic Provisions (except as allowed in section 9(a)(1)) and in any Winter Coverage Endorsement for which you are eligible and which you have elected;

(3) The insured crop must be damaged by an insurable cause of loss to the extent that the remaining stand will not produce at least 90 percent of the production guarantee for the acreage;

(4) The acreage must have been initially planted to a spring type of the insured crop in those counties with only a spring type;

(5) Damage must occur after the winter final planting date in those counties where both a winter and spring final planting date are designated (If the Special Provisions provide more than one winter final planting date, the winter final planting date applicable to policies with the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement will be used for this purpose, regardless of whether or not the endorsement is actually in effect.); and

(6) The replanted crop must be seeded at a rate sufficient to achieve a total (undamaged and new seeding) plant population that is considered appropriate by agricultural experts for the insured crop, type and practice.

(b) No replanting payment will be made for acreage initially planted to a winter type of the insured crop (including rye) in any county for which the Special Provisions contain only a winter type.

(c) Unless otherwise specified in the Special Provisions, the amount of the replanting payment per acre will be:

(1) The lesser of 20 percent of the production guarantee or the number of bushels for the applicable crop specified below:

(i) Two bushels for flax or buckwheat;

(ii) Four bushels for wheat; or

(iii) Five bushels for barley or oats;

(2) Multiplied by:

(i) Your price election for oats, flax, or buckwheat; or

(ii) Your projected price for wheat or barley; and

(3) Multiplied by your share.

(d) When the crop is replanted using a practice that is uninsurable for an original planting, the liability on the unit will be reduced by the amount of the replanting payment. The premium amount will not be reduced.

(e) Replanting payments will be calculated using your price election or your projected price, as applicable, and your production guarantee for the type that is replanted and insured. For example, if damaged spring wheat is replanted to durum wheat, your projected price applicable to durum wheat will be used to calculate any replanting payment that may be due. A revised acreage report will be required to reflect the replanted type. Notwithstanding the previous two sentences, the following will have a replanting payment based on your production guarantee and your price election or your projected price, as applicable, for the type initially planted:

(1) Any damaged winter type that is replanted to a spring type, but that retains insurance based on the winter type; and

(2) Any acreage replanted at a reduced seeding rate into a partially damaged stand of the insured crop.

10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss

Representative samples are required in accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions.

11. Settlement of Claim

(a) We will determine your loss on a unit basis. In the event you are unable to provide records of production that are acceptable to us for any:

(1) Optional unit, we will combine all optional units for which acceptable records of production were not provided; or for any

(2) Basic unit, we will allocate any commingled production to such units in proportion to our liability on the harvested acreage for each unit.

(b) In the event of loss or damage covered by this policy, we will settle your claim by:

(1) Multiplying the number of insured acres of each insured crop or type, as applicable by your respective:

(i) Yield protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected yield protection for barley or wheat;

(ii) Production guarantee (per acre) and your price election for oats, rye, flax, or buckwheat; or

(iii) Revenue protection guarantee (per acre) if you elected revenue protection for barley or wheat;

(2) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(1)(i), (ii), or (iii), whichever is applicable;

(3) Multiplying the production to count of each insured crop or type, as applicable, by your respective:

(i) Projected price for wheat or barley if you elected yield protection;

(ii) Price election for oats, rye, flax, or buckwheat; or

(iii) Harvest price if you elected revenue protection;

(4) Totaling the results of section 11(b)(3)(i), (ii), or (iii), whichever is applicable;

(5) Subtracting the result of section 11(b)(4) from the result of section 11(b)(2); and

(6) Multiplying the result of section 11(b)(5) by your share.

For example:

You have 100 percent share in 50 acres of wheat in the unit with a production guarantee (per acre) of 45 bushels, your projected price is $3.40, your harvest price is $3.45, and your production to count is 2,000 bushels.

If you elected yield protection:

(1) 50 acres × (45 bushel production guarantee × $3.40 projected price) = $7,650.00 value of the production guarantee

(3) 2,000 bushel production to count × $3.40 projected price = $6,800.00 value of the production to count

(5) $7,650.00−$6,800.00 = $850.00

(6) $850.00 × 1.000 share = $850.00 indemnity; or

If you elected revenue protection:

(1) 50 acres × (45 bushel production guarantee × $3.45 harvest price) = $7,762.50 revenue protection guarantee

(3) 2,000 bushel production to count × $3.45 harvest price = $6,900.00 value of the production to count

(5) $7,762.50−$6,900.00 = $862.50

(6) $862.50 × 1.000 share = $863.00 indemnity.

(c) The total production to count (in bushels) from all insurable acreage on the unit will include:

(1) All appraised production as follows:

(i) For oats, rye, flax, or buckwheat, and barley or wheat under yield protection, not less than the production guarantee (per acre), and for barley or wheat under revenue protection, not less than the amount of production that when multiplied by the harvest price equals the revenue protection guarantee (per acre) for acreage:

(A) Which is abandoned;

(B) Put to another use without our consent;

(C) Damaged solely by uninsured causes; or

(D) For which you fail to provide records of production that are acceptable to us;

(ii) Production lost due to uninsured causes;

(iii) Unharvested production (mature unharvested production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies and excess moisture in accordance with subsection 11.(d));

(iv) Potential production on insured acreage that you intend to put to another use or abandon, if you and we agree on the appraised amount of production. Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:

(A) If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for, representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or you fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or

(B) If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and

(2) All harvested production from the insurable acreage.

(d) Mature wheat, barley, oat, rye, and buckwheat production may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. Flax production may be adjusted for quality deficiencies only. If a moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.

(1) Production will be reduced by .12 percent for each .1 percentage point of moisture in excess of:

(i) 13.5 percent for wheat;

(ii) 14.5 percent for barley;

(iii) 14.0 percent for oats;

(iv) 16.0 percent for rye and buckwheat; or

(v) As otherwise provided in the Special Provisions.

We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.

(2) Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if:

(i) Deficiencies in quality, in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain including the definition of terms used in section 11(d), result in:

(A) Wheat, except Khorasan, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight; total damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); shrunken or broken kernels; defects (foreign material and heat damage will not be considered to be defects); a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut odor); or grading garlicky, light smutty, smutty or ergoty;

(B) Barley, except hull-less barley, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grades U.S. No. 5 or worse) because of test weight; percentage of sound barley (heat-damaged kernels will be considered to be sound barley); damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); thin barley; black barley; a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading blighted, smutty, garlicky or ergoty;

(C) Oats, except hull-less oats, not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 4 (grade U.S. sample grade) because of test weight; percentage of sound oats (heat-damaged kernels will be considered to be sound oats); a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading smutty, thin, garlicky or ergoty;

(D) Rye not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 3 (grades U.S. No. 4 or worse) because of test weight; percent damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); thin rye; a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading light smutty, smutty, light garlicky, garlicky, or ergoty;

(E) Flaxseed not meeting the grade requirements for U.S. No. 2 (grades U.S. sample grade) due to test weight; damaged kernels (heat-damaged kernels will not be considered to be damaged); or a musty, sour, or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor);

(ii) Deficiencies in the quality of buckwheat, determined in accordance with applicable state grading standards, result in it not meeting No. 3 grade requirements due to test weight; a musty, sour or commercially objectionable foreign odor (except smut or garlic odor); or grading garlicky, smutty or ergoty if such grades are provided for by the applicable state grading standards;

(iii) Quality factors for Khorasan fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause durum wheat to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if durum wheat grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 54.0 pounds per bushel, Khorasan would be eligible for quality adjustment if its test weight falls below 54.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of durum wheat will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of Khorasan seed. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to Khorasan at the same levels applicable to durum wheat;

(iv) Quality factors for hull-less barley fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause barley to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if barley grades less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel, hull-less barley would be eligible for quality adjustment if its test weight falls below 40.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of barley will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less barley. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less barley at the same levels applicable to barley;

(v) Quality factors for hull-less oats fall below the levels contained in the Official United States Standards for Grain that cause oats to grade less than U.S. No. 4. For example, if oats grade less than U.S. No. 4 when its test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel, hull-less oats would be eligible for quality adjustment if the test weight falls below 27.0 pounds per bushel. The same quality factors considered for quality adjustment of oats will be applicable and determination of deficiencies will be made in accordance with the Federal Grain Inspection Service directive that establishes procedures for quality factor analysis of hull-less oats. Quality adjustment discount factors for U.S. grades specified in the Special Provisions will also apply to hull-less oats at the same levels applicable to oats; or

(vi) Substances or conditions are present, including mycotoxins, that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.

(3) Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:

(i) The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions;

(ii) All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;

(iii) With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjustor), the samples are analyzed by:

(A) A grain grader licensed under the United States Grain Standards Act or the United States Warehouse Act;

(B) A grain grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or

(C) A grain grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and

(iv) With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.

(4) Small grain production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 11(d)(2) and (3), will be reduced by the quality adjustment factor calculated in accordance with the Special Provisions.

(e) Any production harvested from plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.

12. Late Planting

A late planting period is applicable to small grains, except to any barley or wheat acreage covered under the terms of the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement. Barley or wheat covered under the terms of the Winter Coverage Endorsement must be planted on or prior to the applicable final planting date specified in the Special Provisions. In counties having one winter final planting date for acreage covered under the Wheat or Barley Winter Coverage Endorsement and another winter final planting date for acreage not covered under the endorsement, the winter late planting period will begin after the final planting date for acreage not covered under the endorsement.

13. Prevented Planting.

Your prevented planting coverage will be a percentage specified in the actuarial documents of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have additional coverage and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage if such additional coverage is specified in the actuarial documents. In counties for which the Special Provisions designate a spring type, your prevented planting production guarantee will be based on your approved yield for spring-planted acreage of the insured crop.
