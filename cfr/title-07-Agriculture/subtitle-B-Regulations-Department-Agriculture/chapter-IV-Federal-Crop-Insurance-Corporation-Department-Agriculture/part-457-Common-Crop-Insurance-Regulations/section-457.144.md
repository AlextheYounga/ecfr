##### § 457.144 Northern potato crop insurance—processing quality endorsement. #####

The Northern Potato Crop Insurance Processing Quality Endorsement Provisions for the 2022 and succeeding crop years are as follows:

1. Definitions

*Broker.* Any business enterprise regularly engaged in the buying and selling of processing potatoes, that possesses all licenses and permits as required by the state in which it operates, and when required, has the necessary facilities or the contractual access to such facilities, with enough equipment to accept and transfer processing potatoes to the broker within a reasonable amount of time after harvest or the typical storage period.

*Percentage factor.* The term as defined in the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Quality Endorsement.

*Processor.* Any business enterprise regularly engaged in processing potatoes for human consumption, that possesses all licenses and permits for processing potatoes required by the state in which it operates, and that possesses facilities, or has contractual access to such facilities, with enough equipment to accept and process processing potatoes grown under a processing contract within a reasonable amount of time after harvest or the typical storage period.

*Processor contract.* A written agreement between the producer and processor, or between a producer and a broker, containing at a minimum:

(a) The producer's commitment to plant and grow processing potatoes, and to deliver the potato production to the processor or broker;

(b) The processor's or broker's commitment to purchase all the production stated in the processing contract; and

(c) A price or pricing mechanism to determine the value of delivered production.

2. To be eligible for coverage under this endorsement, you must have a:

(a) Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Quality Endorsement in place and elect this endorsement on or before the sales closing date for the initial crop year in which you wish to insure your potatoes under this endorsement:

(1) Cancellation of your Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Quality Endorsement will automatically result in cancellation of this endorsement;

(2) This endorsement may be canceled by either you or us for any succeeding crop year by giving written notice to the other party on or before the cancellation date; and

(b) Processor contract executed with a processor or broker for the potato types insured under this endorsement that is applicable for the crop year:

(1) A copy of the processor contract must be submitted to us on or before the acreage reporting date for potatoes; and

(2) Failure to timely provide the processor contract will result in no coverage under this endorsement and coverage will be provided only under the terms of the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Provisions and Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Quality Endorsement.

3. The additional premium amount for this coverage will be determined by multiplying the number of your insured planted acres of potatoes by the premium rate for this Endorsement contained in the actuarial documents. In return for payment of the additional premium designated in the actuarial documents, this Endorsement is attached to and made part of your Northern Potato Crop Insurance Provisions and Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Quality Endorsement subject to the terms and conditions described herein. In the event of a conflict between the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Provisions or Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Quality Endorsement and this Endorsement, this Endorsement will control.

4. All terms of the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Quality Endorsement not modified by this endorsement will be applicable to acreage covered under this endorsement.

5. If you elect this endorsement, all insurable acreage of production under contract with the processor or broker must be insured under this endorsement; however:

(a) When the processor contract requires the processor or broker to purchase a stated amount of production, rather than all of the production from a stated number of acres, the insurable acres will be determined by dividing the stated amount of production by the approved yield for the acreage; and

(b) The number of acres insured under this endorsement will not exceed the actual number of acres planted to the potato types needed to fulfill the contract.

6. Potato lots may be adjusted in accordance with section 8 if such potatoes:

(a) Fail to meet the standards in section 7(a), (b), (c), or (d), or a standard contained in the processor contract, for the same quality factors specified in section 7(a), (b), (c), or (d), if such standard is less stringent;

(b) Have a value less than the maximum price election; and

(c) Fail to meet the applicable standards and are not separable from undamaged production using methods used by processors to whom you normally deliver your potato production.

7. To qualify for a quality reduction under this endorsement, the potatoes must:

(a) Fail to meet the applicable U.S. No. 2 grade requirements due to internal defects as long as the number of potatoes with such defects are in excess of the tolerance allowed for U.S. No. 2 grade potatoes;

(b) Have a specific gravity lower than 1.074;

(c) Have a fry color of No. 3 or darker due to either sugar exceeding 10 percent or sugar ends exceeding 19 percent; or

(d) Have an Agtron rating lower than 58.

8. In lieu of the provisions contained in section 5 of the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Quality Endorsement, production to count determined in accordance with section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Provisions, from unharvested acreage or harvested acreage that is stored or is marketed after a grade inspection determined in section 10, will be adjusted in accordance with sections 8(a) or 8(b), whichever is applicable, (adjustment under section 8(a) or 8(b)(1) will not be performed if it already has been performed under the terms of section 11(g) of the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Provisions):

(a) If a price is agreed upon between you and a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Storage Coverage Endorsementis applicable) after the end of the insurance period, or the production is delivered to a buyer within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be determined by:

(1) Dividing the price per hundredweight received or that will be received by the highest price election designated in the actuarial documents for the insured potato type (If the production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price you could have received in the local market); and

(2) Multiplying the result of section 8(a)(1) (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or

(b) If a price is not agreed upon between you and a buyer and the production is not delivered within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Storage Coverage Endorsementis applicable), after the end of the insurance period, and the production remains in storage 22 or more days (61 or more days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production will be the greater of:

(1) The amount of production determined by:

(i) Dividing the price per hundredweight that is received, or that will later be received after the end of the applicable insurance period, by the highest price election designated in the actuarial documents for the insured potato type (if the production is sold for a price lower than the value appropriate to and representative of the local market, we will determine the value of the production based on the price you could have received in the local market); and

(ii) Multiplying the result of section 8(b)(1)(i) (not to exceed 1.0) by the number of hundredweight of sold or to be sold production (We may verify this after the production has actually been sold); or

(2) The amount of production determined as follows:

(i) The combined weight of sampled potatoes that grade U.S. No. 2 or better (the amount of potatoes grading U.S. No. 2 or better will be based on a grade inspection completed no later than 21 days after the end of the insurance period, if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable; samples must be obtained within 60 days after the end of the insurance period and grade inspection completed within 21 days of sampling) and are damaged by freeze or tuber rot will be divided by the total sample weight;

(*A*) The percentage determined in section 8(b)(2)(i) will be divided by the applicable percentage factor; and

(B) The result of section 8(b)(2)(i)(A) will be multiplied by the amount of production to count determined in accordance with section 15 of the Basic Provisions and section 11 of the Northern Potato Crop Insurance Provisions.

(c) The production to count for potatoes that have a value less than the maximum price election due to factors other than those specified in section 7 will be adjusted in accordance with section 8(b)(2).

9. For any production that qualifies for adjustment in accordance with section 7 and that is discarded:

(a) Within 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production to count will be:

(1) Zero if we determine the production could not have been sold; or

(2) Determined in accordance with section 8(b)(2) if we determine the production could have been sold; or

(b) Later than 21 days (60 days if the Northern Potato Crop Insurance—Storage Coverage Endorsement is applicable), after the end of the insurance period, the amount of production to count will be adjusted in accordance with section 8(b)(2).

10. All quality determinations must be based upon a grade inspection using the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes for Processing or the United States Standards for Grades of Potatoes for Chipping.

11. The actuarial documents may provide “U.S. No. 1 grade” in place of “U.S. No. 2 grade” as used in this endorsement. If both U.S. No. 1 and 2 grades are available in the actuarial documents, you may elect U.S. No. 1 or 2 grade by potato type or group, if separate types or groups are specified in the Special Provisions.
