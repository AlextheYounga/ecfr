In return for payment of premium for the coverage contained herein, this endorsement will be attached to and made part of the Nursery Crop Insurance Provisions, subject to the terms and conditions described herein.

1. Definitions

*Coverage commencement date.* The later of the date you declare as the beginning of the coverage or 30 days after a properly completed Peak Inventory Value Report is received by us.

*Coverage term.* A period of time that begins on the coverage commencement date and ends on the coverage termination date.

*Coverage termination date.* The date you declare that the peak amount of insurance will cease. This date cannot be after the end of the crop year.

*Peak amount of insurance.* The additional inventory value reported on the Peak Inventory Value Report for each basic unit multiplied by your coverage level and by your share.

*Peak Inventory Value Report.* A report that increases the value of insurable plants over the value reported on the PIVR, declares the coverage commencement and coverage termination dates, and the other requirements of section 6 of the Nursery Crop Insurance Provisions.

Example of Peak Inventory Endorsement Total Premium Calculation

Assume a grower reports a peak amount of insurance on a basic unit of $100,000 with a 65 percent coverage level and a share of 1.000. The base premium rate is $0.051. The proration factors for the Peak Inventory Endorsement are 0.68 for the month that coverage commenced and 0.52 for the month following the month containing the coverage termination date, as stated in the actuarial documents. The peak premium adjustment factor is 0.16 (0.68 − 0.52). The total premium amount for the Peak Inventory Endorsement is $530.40 ($100,000 × 0.65 × 1.000 × $0.051 × 0.16).
