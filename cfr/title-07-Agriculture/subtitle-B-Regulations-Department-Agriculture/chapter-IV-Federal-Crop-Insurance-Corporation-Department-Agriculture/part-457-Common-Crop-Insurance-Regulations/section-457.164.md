(i) The type of damage (e.g., broken limbs from high winds, trees uprooted by hurricane, etc.);

(iii) Whether the plant can recover to the point it is marketable;

(2) Verifiable records must be provided showing actual expenditures for rehabilitation and such expenditures must be reasonable and customary for the type and extent of damage sustained by the plants;

(3) Rehabilitation procedures must be performed directly following the occurrence of damage and before additional deterioration of the damaged plants occurs;

(4) We must determine it is practical to rehabilitate the damaged plants (It is not practical if the costs of rehabilitation are greater than the value of the plant); and
