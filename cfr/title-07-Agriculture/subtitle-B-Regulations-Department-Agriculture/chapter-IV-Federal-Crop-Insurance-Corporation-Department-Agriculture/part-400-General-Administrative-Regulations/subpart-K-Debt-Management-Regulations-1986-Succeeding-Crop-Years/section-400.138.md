##### ยง 400.138 Procedures for salary offset; methods of collection. #####

(a) *General.* A debt will be collected by deductions at officially-established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless the employee and the hearing official agree to alternative arrangements for repayment under ยง 400.135.

(b) *Installment deductions.* Installment deductions will be made over a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size and frequency of the installment deductions will bear a reasonable relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. If possible, the installment payment will be sufficient in size and frequency to liquidate the debt in no more than three years. Installment payments of less than $25.00 per pay period, or $50.00 per month, will be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.
