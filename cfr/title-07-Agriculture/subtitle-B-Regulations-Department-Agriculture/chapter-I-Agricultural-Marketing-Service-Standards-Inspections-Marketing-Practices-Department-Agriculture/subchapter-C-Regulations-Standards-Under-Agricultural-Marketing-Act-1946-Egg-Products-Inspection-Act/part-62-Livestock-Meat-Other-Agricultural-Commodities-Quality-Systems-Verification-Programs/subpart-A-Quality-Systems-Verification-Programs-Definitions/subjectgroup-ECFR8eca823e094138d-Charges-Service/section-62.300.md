(a) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for quality systems verification services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:

(1) *Regular rate.* The total AMS quality systems verification program (QSVP) personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

(2) *Overtime rate.* The total AMS QSVP personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

(3) *Holiday rate.* The total AMS QSVP personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

(b)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:

(i) *Benefits rate.* The total AMS QSVP direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.

(ii) *Operating rate.* The total AMS QSVP operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.

(iii) *Allowance for bad debt rate.* Total AMS QSVP allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.

(2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.

(c) *Transportation costs.* Applicants are responsible for paying actual travel costs incurred to provide QSVP services including but not limited to: Mileage charges for use of privately owned vehicles, rental vehicles and gas, parking, tolls, and public transportation costs such as airfare, train, and taxi service.

(d) *Per diem costs.* The applicant is responsible for paying per diem costs incurred to provide QSVP services away from the auditor's or USDA officials' official duty station(s). Per diem costs shall be calculated in accordance with existing travel regulations (41 CFR, subtitle F - Federal Travel Regulation System, chapter 301).

(e) *Other costs.* When costs, other than those costs specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, are involved in providing the QSVP services, the applicant shall be responsible for these costs. The amount of these costs shall be determined administratively by the Chief. However, the applicant will be notified of these costs before the service is rendered.
