##### ยง 70.71 On a fee basis. #####

Unless otherwise provided in this part, the fees to be charged and collected for any grading or audit service performed in accordance with this part, on a fee basis shall be based on the applicable formulas specified in this section.

(a) For each calendar year, AMS will calculate the rate for grading and audit services, per hour per program employee using the following formulas:

(1) *Regular rate.* The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase, plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus the allowance for bad debt rate. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

(2) *Overtime rate.* The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 1.5 plus the benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

(3) *Holiday rate.* The total AMS grading or audit program personnel direct pay divided by direct hours, which is then multiplied by the next year's percentage of cost of living increase and then multiplied by 2, plus benefits rate, plus the operating rate, plus an allowance for bad debt. If applicable, travel expenses may also be added to the cost of providing the service.

(b)(1) For each calendar year, based on previous fiscal year/historical actual costs, AMS will calculate the benefits, operating, and allowance for bad debt components of the regular, overtime and holiday rates as follows:

(i) *Benefits rate.* The total AMS grading or audit program direct benefits costs divided by the total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the next calendar year's percentage cost of living increase. Some examples of direct benefits are health insurance, retirement, life insurance, and Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) retirement basic and matching contributions.

(ii) *Operating rate.* The AMS grading or audit program total operating costs divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked, which is then multiplied by the percentage of inflation.

(iii) *Allowance for bad debt rate.* Total AMS grading or audit program allowance for bad debt divided by total hours (regular, overtime, and holiday) worked.

(2) The calendar year cost of living expenses and percentage of inflation factors used in the formulas in this section are based on the most recent Office of Management and Budget's Presidential Economic Assumptions.

(c) Fees for grading services will be based on the time required to perform the services. The hourly charges shall include the time actually required to perform the grading, waiting time, travel time, and any clerical costs involved in issuing a certificate.

(d) Fees for audit services will be based on the time and expenses required to perform the audit. The hourly charge shall include the time actually required to perform the audit, waiting time, travel time, and any clerical costs involved in issuing an audit report.
