##### § 51.562 U.S. No. 2. #####

“U.S. No. 2” consists of stalks of celery of similar varietal characteristics which are reasonably well developed, reasonably well formed, fairly well trimmed and are free from blackheart and soft rot and free from serious damage caused by freezing, growth cracks, horizontal cracks, pithy branches, seedstems, dirt, doubles, wilting, blight, other disease, insects or mechanical or other means. Stalks shall be green unless specified as fairly well blanched, or mixed blanch.

(a) Unless otherwise specified, the average midrib length of the outer whorl of branches shall be not less than 4 inches.

(b) Unless otherwise specified in connection with the grade, stalks shall be of such length as to extend from one side, end or bottom of the container to within 11/2 inches of the corresponding opposite side, end or top of the container. Such measurement shall not include the bulge. In any container when stalk length is specified, it shall be the minimum length in terms of whole inches of even number, as 12 inches, 14 inches, etc., in accordance with the facts.

(c) In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling, the following tolerances shall be permitted:

(1) *For defects.* 10 percent, by count, in any lot for stalks which fail to meet the requirements of the grade, including therein not more than 2 percent for soft rot;

(2) *For off-length stalks.* 5 percent, by count, in any lot for stalks which fail to meet the minimum length required or specified; and,

(3) *For off-length midribs.* 5 percent, by count, in any lot for stalks which fail to meet the requirements as to average midrib length.
