*Damage* means any specific defect described in this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts from the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the cantaloup. The following specific defects shall be considered as damage:

(a) Liquid in the seed cavity under the following circumstances:

(1) At shipping point when more than a slight amount of liquid is present in the seed cavity; or,

(2) En route or at destination when an objectionably large amount of liquid is present in the seed cavity, or when the flesh of the cavity wall is mushy or noticeably discolored;

(b) Sunburn when the color of the flesh is materially changed; when the rind is hard, tough, thin, or definitely flattened; when distinct flattening of the netting or dark yellow surface discoloration affects an aggregate area exceeding 20 percent of the surface of the cantaloup; or when brown, gray, purple or dark green surface discoloration detracts from the appearance of the cantaloup to a greater extent than the area of dark yellow discoloration permitted;

(c) Hail when the injury is unhealed or deep;

(d) Surface mold under the following circumstances:

(1) At shipping point when any surface mold is visible; or,

(2) En route or at destination when the color, character, or location of the mold materially detracts from the appearance or marketing quality of the cantaloup;

(e) Aphis when aphis honeydew is more than slightly sticky, or when resulting discoloration more than slightly detracts from the appearance of the cantaloup;

(f) Scars when healed, shallow, smooth and light colored and the aggregate area affected exceeds 5 percent of the surface of the cantaloup; or when deep, rough or dark colored and detracting from the appearance to a greater extent than the area of healed, shallow, smooth and light colored scars permitted. Smooth scarring at the blossom end and coalesced netting should not be considered in determining damage caused by scarring unless materially detracting from the appearance of the cantaloup;

(g) Cracks when deep or not dry. Slight, dry cracks at the ends or in the sutures of the cantaloup shall not be considered damage;

(h) Ground spot when the rind of the affected area is thin or weak, or when the size or color of the affected area or the character of netting on the area in relation to the remainder of the surface of the cantaloup materially detracts from the appearance of the cantaloup;

(i) Bruises when the surface of the cantaloup is definitely flattened or indented, or when the underlying flesh is noticeably discolored; and,

(j) Mechanical means when cuts or gouges are deep or when any skin break is unhealed.
