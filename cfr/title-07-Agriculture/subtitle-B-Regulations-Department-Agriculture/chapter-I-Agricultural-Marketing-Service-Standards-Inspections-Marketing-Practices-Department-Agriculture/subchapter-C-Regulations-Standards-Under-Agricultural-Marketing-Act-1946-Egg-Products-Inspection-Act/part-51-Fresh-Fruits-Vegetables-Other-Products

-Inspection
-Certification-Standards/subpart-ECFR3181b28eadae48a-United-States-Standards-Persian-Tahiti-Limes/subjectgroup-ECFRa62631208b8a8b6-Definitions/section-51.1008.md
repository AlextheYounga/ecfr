##### ยง 51.1008 Fairly smooth texture. #####

*Fairly smooth texture* means that the fruit is comparatively free from lumpiness and that pebbling is not abnormally coarse. Coarse pebbling is not objectionable as it is indicative of good keeping quality and is characteristic of the fruit, especially that from young trees.
