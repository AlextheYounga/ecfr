The greatest diameter of the stalk shall be measured at a point two inches above the point of attachment of the outer branches to the root. The length of the seedstem shall be measured from the point of attachment of the outer branches at the base of the seedstem to the top of the actual seedstem, exclusive of any leaves or leaf stems attached to the top of the seedstem.

(f) Rust, when there are more than five hair-like lines of any length on one or more heart branches, or when there is more than one square inch in the aggregate on branches other than heart branches.
