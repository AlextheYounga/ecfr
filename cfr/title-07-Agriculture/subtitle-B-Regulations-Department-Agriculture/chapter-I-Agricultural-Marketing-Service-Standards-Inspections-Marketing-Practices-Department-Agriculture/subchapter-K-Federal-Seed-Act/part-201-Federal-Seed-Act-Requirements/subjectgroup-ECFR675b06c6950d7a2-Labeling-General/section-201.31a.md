##### § 201.31a Labeling treated seed. #####

(a) *Contents of label.* Any agricultural seed or any mixture thereof or any vegetable seed or any mixture thereof, for seeding purposes, that has been treated shall be labeled in type no smaller than 8 point to indicate that the seed has been treated and to show the name of any substance or a description of any process (other than application of a substance) used in such treatment, in accordance with this section; for example,

Treated with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (name of substance or process) or \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (name of substance or process) treated.

If the substance used in such treatment in the amount remaining with the seed is harmful to humans or other vertebrate animals, the seed shall also bear a label containing additional statements as required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. The label shall contain the required information in any form that is clearly legible and complies with the regulations in this part. The information may be on the tag bearing the analysis information or on a separate tag, or it may be printed in a conspicuous manner on a side or top of the container.

(b) *Name of substance or active ingredient.* The name of any active ingredient substance as required by paragraph (a) of this section shall be the commonly accepted coined, chemical (generic), or abbreviated chemical name. The label shall include either the name of the genus and species or the brand name as identified on biological product labels. Commonly accepted coined names are free for general use by the public, are not private trademarks, and are commonly recognized as names of particular substances, such as thiram, captan, lindane, and dichlone. Examples of commonly accepted chemical (generic) names are blue-stone, calcium carbonate, cuprous oxide, zinc hydroxide, hexachlorobenzene, and ethyl mercury acetate. The terms “mercury” or “mercurial” may be used in labeling all types of mercurials. Examples of commonly accepted abbreviated chemical names are BHC (1,2,3,4,5,6-Hexachlorocyclohexane) and DDT (dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane).

(c) *Mercurials and similarly toxic substances.* (1) Seed treated with a mercurial or similarly toxic substance (Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Category I), if any amount remains with the seed, shall be labeled to show a representation of a skull and crossbones at least twice the size of the type used for information required to be on the label under paragraph (a) and shall also include in red letters on a background of distinctly contrasting color a statement worded substantially as follows: “This seed has been treated with Poison,” “Treated with Poison,” “Poison treated,” or “Poison”. The word “Poison” shall appear in type no less than 8 point.

(2) Mercurials and similarly toxic substances (Environmental Protection Agency Toxicity Category I) include the following:

Aldrin, technical Demeton Dieldrin p-Dimethylaminobenzenediazo sodium sulfonate Endrin Ethion Heptachlor Mercurials, all types Parathion Phorate Toxaphene O - O - Diethyl-O-(isopropyl-4-methyl-6-py- rimidyl) thiophosphate O, O-Diethyl-S-2-(ethylthio) ethyl phosphorodithioateAny amount of such substances remaining with the seed is considered harmful within the meaning of this section.

(d) *Other harmful substances.* If a substance, other than one which would be classified as a mercurial or similarly toxic substance under paragraph (c) of this section, is used in the treatment of seed, and the amount remaining with the seed is harmful to humans or other vertebrate animals, the seed shall be labeled with an appropriate caution statement in type no smaller than 8 point worded substantially as follows: “Do not use for food,” “Do not use for feed,” “Do not use for oil purposes,” or “Do not use for food, feed, or oil purposes.” Any amount of any substance, not within paragraph (c) of this section, used in the treatment of the seed, which remains with the seed is considered harmful within the meaning of this section when the seed is in containers of more than 4 ounces, except that the following substances shall not be deemed harmful when present at a rate less than the number of parts per million indicated:

Allethrin—2 p.p.m.

Malathion—8 p.p.m.

Methoxyclor—2 p.p.m.

Piperonyl butoxide—8 p.p.m. on oat and sorghum and 20 p.p.m. on all other seeds.

Pyrethrins—1 p.p.m. on oat and sorghum and 3 p.p.m. on all other seeds.
