##### ยง 97.178 Refunds. #####

Money paid by mistake or excess payments shall be refunded, but a mere change of plans after the payment of money, as when a party decides to withdraw an application or to withdraw an appeal, shall not entitle a party to a refund. However, the examination or search fee shall be refunded if an application is voluntarily abandoned pursuant to ยง 97.23(a) before a search or examination has begun. Amounts of $1 or less shall not be refunded unless specifically demanded.
