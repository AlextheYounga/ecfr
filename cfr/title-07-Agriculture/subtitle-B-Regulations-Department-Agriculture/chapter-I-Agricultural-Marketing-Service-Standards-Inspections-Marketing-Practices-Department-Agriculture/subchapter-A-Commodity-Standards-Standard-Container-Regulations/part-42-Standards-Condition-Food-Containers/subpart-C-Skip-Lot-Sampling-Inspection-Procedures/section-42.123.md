##### ยง 42.123 Flow diagram for skip lot sampling and inspection. #####

![](/graphics/ec02se91.000.gif)Notes:

1. Only normal inspection is permitted.

2. All lot selections for the one-half and one-fourth sampling rates must be strictly random (for example, not every other lot or every fourth lot).

3. Two exceptions to the procedures shown above are as follows:

(a) The skip lot sampling and inspection rate of one-half can be instituted immediately if the lots from the producer are currently on, or eligible to be on, reduced inspection and all other conditions in ยง 42.120 are met. When skip lot inspection begins, however, only normal inspection is permitted.

(b) While inspecting every lot consecutively as offered for inspection, i.e., while not on the one-half or one-fourth rate, if requirements for switching from normal to tightened inspection are met as specified in ยง 42.108 then skip lot procedures terminate, tightened inspection is initiated, and stationary lot sampling and inspection procedures in Subpart B are instituted. Skip lot procedures may be instituted again only when all conditions of ยง 42.120 are met.
