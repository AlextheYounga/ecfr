##### ยง 29.3101 Elements of quality and degrees of each element. #####

These standardized words or terms are used to describe tobacco quality and to assist in interpreting grade specifications. Tobacco attributes or characteristics which constitute quality are designated as elements of quality. The range within each element is expressed by the use of words or terms designated as degrees. These several degrees are arranged to show their relative value, but the actual value of each degree varies with type, group, and grade. In each case the first and last degrees represent the full range for the element, and the intermediate degrees show gradual steps between them.
