##### § 51.1436 Size classifications for pieces. #####

The size of pecan pieces in a lot may be specified in accordance with one of the size classifications shown in table 1 to this section. Sizes are measured using a round-hole screen.

(a) *Tolerances for size of pieces.* In order to allow for variations incident to proper sizing, tolerances are provided for pieces in a lot which fail to meet the requirements of any size specified. The tolerances, by weight, are as follows:

(1) *U.S. Extra Fancy pieces and U.S. Fancy pieces.* Not more than 15 percent of the lot may fall outside of the size range in Table 1 to this section. Further, not more than 1 percent of the pieces, excluding Topping Pieces and Granules, may pass through an eight sixty-fourths of an inch round hole screen.

(2) *U.S. Choice pieces.* Not more than 20 percent of the lot may fall outside of the size range in Table 1 to this section. Further, not more than 2 percent of the pieces, excluding Topping Pieces and Granules, may pass through an eight sixty-fourths of an inch round hole screen.

(3) *U.S. Standard pieces.* Not more than 25 percent of the lot may fall outside of the size range in table 1 to this section. Further, not more than 2 percent of the pieces, excluding Topping Pieces and Granules, may pass through an eight sixty-fourths of an inch round hole screen.

(b) [Reserved]
