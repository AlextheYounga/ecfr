(b) “Fairly uniform in size” means that not more than 10 percent of fruit in any lot, and not more than double that amount in any sample, are outside the ranges of diameters given in Table 1 to this section:

|Pack size/Number of grapefruit|Diameter in inches|       |
|------------------------------|------------------|-------|
|           Minimum            |     Maximum      |       |

|              64              |        3         |3-8/16 |

(c) “Uniform in size” means that not more than 10 percent of fruit in any lot, and not more than double that amount in any sample, may vary more than the following amounts:

(1) 32 size and smaller—not more than six-sixteenths inch in diameter; and

(2) 27 size and larger—not more than nine-sixteenths inch in diameter.

(d) In order to allow for variations, other than sizing, incident to proper packing, not more than 5 percent of the packages in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of standard pack.
