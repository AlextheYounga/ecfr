(b) “U.S. Grade B” is the quality of Raisins with Seeds that have similar varietal characteristics; that have a reasonably good typical color with not more than 15 percent, by weight, that may be dark reddish-brown berries; that have a good characteristic flavor; that show development characteristics of raisins prepared from reasonably well-matured grapes; with not less than 70 percent, by weight, of raisins that are well-matured or reasonably well matured; that contain not more than 18 percent, by weight, of moisture, except that any seeded raisins may contain not more than 19 percent, by weight, of moisture; and meet the additional requirements as outlined in Table II of this subpart.

(c) “U.S. Grade C” is the quality of Raisins with Seeds that have similar varietal characteristics; that have a fairly good typical color with not more than 20 percent, by weight, that may be dark reddish-brown berries; that have a fairly good flavor; that show development characteristics of raisins prepared from fairly well-matured grapes; that contain not more than 18 percent, by weight, of moisture, except that any seeded raisins may contain not more than 19 percent, by weight, of moisture; and meet the additional requirements as outlined in Table II of this subpart.
