##### § 29.3153 Leaf (B Group). #####

This group consists of leaves normally grown above the midpoint of the stalk. Cured leaves from the upper stalk position have a tendency to fold, concealing the face of the leaf and exposing the stem or midrib. These leaves have a pointed tip and generally are medium to heavy in body. They are narrower in relation to their length than corresponding qualities of the C Group.
