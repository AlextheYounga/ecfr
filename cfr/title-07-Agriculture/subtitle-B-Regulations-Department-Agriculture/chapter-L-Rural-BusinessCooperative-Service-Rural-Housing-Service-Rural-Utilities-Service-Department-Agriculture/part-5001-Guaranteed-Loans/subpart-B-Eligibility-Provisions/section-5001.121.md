The Borrower must be the owner of the conduit. The conduit must be installed at the time of project construction and must be for public use.

(3) When necessary as part of a guaranteed loan to finance a project:

(i) Guarantee fees, as determined under § 5001.454;

(ii) Lender fees, as provided in § 5001.403;

(iii) Professional service fees and charges provided the Agency agrees that the amounts are reasonable and customary in the area;

(vii) Obligations for construction worked performed prior to filing an Application with the Agency. Construction work must not be started (and obligations for such work or materials must not be incurred) before the conditional commitment is issued.

(B) Modify the outstanding contract to conform to the provisions of this part. When this is not possible, modifications will be made to the extent practicable and, at a minimum, the contract must comply with all State and local laws and regulations as well as statutory requirements and Executive Orders related to the Agency guarantee.

(C) When construction is complete and it is impracticable to modify the contract, the borrower and lender must provide a certification by an engineer or architect that any construction performed complies fully with the plans and specifications; and

(D) The borrower and the contractor must have complied with all statutory and Executive Order requirements related to the Agency guarantee for construction already performed even though the requirements may not have been included in the contract documents.

The borrower must take no action until the conclusion of the environmental review process prior to any action that would have an adverse effect on the environment or limit the choices of any reasonable alternatives to be considered by the Agency.
