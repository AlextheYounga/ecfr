(h) Rental for the use of equipment or machinery owned by the borrower.

(i) For purposes not directly related to operating and maintaining the project.

(k) Agricultural tillage equipment, used equipment, and vehicles are ineligible for loans as specified under REAP.

(l) Guaranteed loan funds cannot be used for the distribution or payment to a member of the immediate family of an owner, partner, stockholder, or member of the borrower except for a change in ownership of the business where the selling person does not retain an ownership interest and the Agency determines in writing the price paid to be reasonable based upon an independent appraisal. This prohibition does not apply to transfers of ownership for ESOPs or worker cooperatives, to cooperatives where the cooperative pays the member for product or services, or where member stock is transferred among members of the cooperative in accordance with § 5001.140 of this part.
