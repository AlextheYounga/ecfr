##### ยง 372.10 Supplementing environmental impact statements. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 24011, May 24, 2018.

Once a decision to supplement an environmental impact statement is made, a notice of intent will be published. The administrative record will thereafter be open. The supplemental document will then be processed in the same fashion (exclusive of scoping) as a draft and a final statement (unless alternative procedures are approved by CEQ) and will become part of the administrative record.
