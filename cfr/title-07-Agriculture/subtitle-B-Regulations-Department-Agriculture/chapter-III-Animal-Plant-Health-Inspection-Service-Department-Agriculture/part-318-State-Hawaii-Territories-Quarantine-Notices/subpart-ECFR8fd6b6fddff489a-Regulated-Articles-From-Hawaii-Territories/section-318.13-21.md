(ii) The transloading is carried out within the secure area of the airport (*i.e.*, that area of the airport that is open only to personnel authorized by the airport security authorities);

(iii) The area used for any storage of the consignment is within the secure area of the airport, and is either locked or guarded at all times the avocados are present. The avocados must be kept in a sealed container while stored in the continental United States en route to Alaska; and

(iv) APHIS inspectors supervise the transloading.

(3) *Exceptions.* No transloading other than that described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section is allowed except under extenuating circumstances (such as equipment breakdown) and when authorized and supervised by an APHIS inspector.
