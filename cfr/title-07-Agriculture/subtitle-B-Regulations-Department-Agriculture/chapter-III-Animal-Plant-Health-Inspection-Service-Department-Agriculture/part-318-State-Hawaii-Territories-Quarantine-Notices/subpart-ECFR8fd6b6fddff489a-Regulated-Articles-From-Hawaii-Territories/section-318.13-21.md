If the avocados arrive at either Portland, OR, or Seattle, WA, they may be transloaded only under the following conditions:

(1) *Consignments by sea.* The avocados may be transloaded from one ship to another ship at the port of arrival, provided they remain in the original sealed container and that APHIS inspectors supervise the transloading. If the avocados are stored before reloading, they must be kept in the original sealed container and must be in an area that is either locked or guarded at all times the avocados are present.

(2) *Consignments by air.* The avocados may be transloaded from one aircraft to another aircraft at the port of arrival, provided the following conditions are met:

(i) The transloading is done into sealable containers;

(ii) The transloading is carried out within the secure area of the airport (*i.e.*, that area of the airport that is open only to personnel authorized by the airport security authorities);

(iii) The area used for any storage of the consignment is within the secure area of the airport, and is either locked or guarded at all times the avocados are present. The avocados must be kept in a sealed container while stored in the continental United States en route to Alaska; and

(iv) APHIS inspectors supervise the transloading.

(3) *Exceptions.* No transloading other than that described in paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section is allowed except under extenuating circumstances (such as equipment breakdown) and when authorized and supervised by an APHIS inspector.

(f) *Limited permit.* Consignments of avocados must be accompanied by a limited permit issued by an APHIS inspector in accordance with § 318.13-3(c). The limited permit will be issued only if the inspector examines the consignment and determines that the consignment has been prepared in compliance with the provisions of this section.
