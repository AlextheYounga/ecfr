##### ยง 330.204 Denial or cancellation of permits; reconsiderations. #####

(a) The Deputy Administrator will deny an application for a permit to move a plant pest when, in his opinion, such movement would involve a danger of dissemination of the pest. Danger of plant pest dissemination may be deemed to exist when:

(1) No acceptable safeguards adequate to prevent plant pest dissemination can be arranged;

(2) The destructive potential of the plant pest to plants, and parts and products thereof, should it escape despite proposed safeguards, outweighs the probable benefits to be derived from the proposed movement and use of the pest;

(3) The applicant, as a previous permittee, failed to maintain the safeguards or otherwise observe the conditions prescribed in a previous permit and failed to demonstrate his ability or intent to observe them in the future;

(4) The movement is adverse to the conduct of an eradication, suppression, control, or regulatory program of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; or

(5) The movement is objected to in writing by an appropriate official of a State, Territory or possession, or the District of Columbia on the ground it will involve a danger of dissemination of the plant pest into the State, Territory or possession, or District.

(b) The Deputy Administrator may cancel any outstanding permit whenever:

(1) Information is received subsequent to the issuance of the permit of circumstances that constitute cause for the denial of an application for permit under paragraph (a) of this section; or

(2) The permittee has not maintained the safeguards or otherwise observed the conditions specified in the permit or in any applicable regulations or administrative instructions.

(c) Any person denied a permit, or whose permit has been canceled, may request the Deputy Administrator in person or in writing for a reconsideration, and may submit any additional information he may have to support the original application.
