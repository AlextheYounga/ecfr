##### § 340.2 Groups of organisms which are or contain plant pests and exemptions. #####

(a) *Groups of organisms which are or contain plant pests.* The organisms that are or contain plant pests are included in the taxa or group of organisms contained in the following list. Within any taxonomic series included on the list, the lowest unit of classification actually listed is the taxon or group which may contain organisms which are regulated. Organisms belonging to all lower taxa contained within the group listed are included as organisms that may be or may contain plant pests, and are regulated *if they meet the definition of plant pest in § 340.1*4

4 Any organism belonging to any taxa contained within any listed genera or taxa is only considered to be a plant pest if the organism “can directly or indirectly injure, or cause disease, or damage in any plants or parts thereof, or any processed, manufactured, or other products of plants.” Thus a particular unlisted species within a listed genus would be deemed a plant pest for purposes of § 340.2, if the scientific literature refers to the organism as a cause of direct or indirect injury, disease, or damage to any plants, plant parts or products of plants. (If there is any question concerning the plant pest status of an organism belonging to any listed genera or taxa, the person proposing to introduce the organism in question should consult with APHIS to determine if the organism is subject to regulation.)

Note:

Any genetically engineered organism composed of DNA or RNA sequences, organelles, plasmids, parts, copies, and/or analogs, of or from any of the groups of organisms listed below shall be deemed a regulated article if it also meets the definition of plant pest in § 340.1.

(b) *Exemptions.* (1) A limited permit for interstate movement shall not be required for genetic material from any plant pest contained in *Escherichia coli* genotype K-12 (strain K-12 and its derivatives), sterile strains of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae,* or asporogenic strains of *Bacillus subtilis,* provided that all the following conditions are met:
