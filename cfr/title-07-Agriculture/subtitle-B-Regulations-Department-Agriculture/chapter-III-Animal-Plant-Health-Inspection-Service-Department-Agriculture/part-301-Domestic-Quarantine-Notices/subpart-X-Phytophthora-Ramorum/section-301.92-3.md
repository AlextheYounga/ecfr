##### § 301.92-3 Quarantined areas and regulated establishments. #####

(a) *Quarantined areas.* (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the Administrator will designate as a quarantined area in paragraph (a)(3) of this section each State, or each portion of a State, in which *Phytophthora ramorum* has been confirmed by an inspector to be established in the natural environment, in which the Administrator has reason to believe that *Phytophthora ramorum* is present in the natural environment, or that the Administrator considers it necessary to quarantine because of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from localities in which *Phytophthora ramorum* has been found in the natural environment. Less than an entire area will be designated as a quarantined area only if the Administrator determines that:

(i) The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the intrastate movement of regulated, restricted, and associated articles that are substantially the same as those imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated, restricted, and associated articles; and

(ii) The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined area will prevent the interstate spread of *Phytophthora ramorum.*

(2) The Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonquarantined area as a quarantined area in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The Administrator will give a copy of this regulation along with a written notice for the temporary designation to the owner or person in possession of the nonquarantined area. Thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated, restricted, or associated article from an area temporarily designated as a quarantined area will be subject to this subpart. As soon as practicable, this area will be added to the list in paragraph (a)(3) of this section or the designation will be terminated by the Administrator or an inspector. The owner or person in possession of an area for which designation is terminated will be given notice of the termination as soon as practicable.
