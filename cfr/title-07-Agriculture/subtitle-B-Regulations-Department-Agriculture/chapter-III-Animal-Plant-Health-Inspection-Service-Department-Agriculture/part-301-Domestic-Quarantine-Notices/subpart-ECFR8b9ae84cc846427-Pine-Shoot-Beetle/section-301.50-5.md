(1)(i) The regulated article is to be moved interstate to a specified destination for specified handling, processing, or utilization (the destination and other conditions to be listed in the limited permit), and this interstate movement will not result in the spread of the pine shoot beetle.

<sup>1</sup> If a pine shoot beetle is detected in any one of the trees being sampled, the entire shipment must be rejected. If no pine shoot beetle is detected in any of the trees sampled, the shipment will be allowed to move with a limited permit. The limited permit must state, “All trees that remain unsold as of December 25 must be destroyed by burning or chipping, or must be fumigated, prior to January 1.”

(d) Certificates and limited permits for use for interstate movement of regulated articles may be issued by an inspector or person operating under a compliance agreement. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a certificate for the interstate movement of a regulated article if an inspector has determined that the regulated article is otherwise eligible for a certificate in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section. A person operating under a compliance agreement may issue a limited permit for interstate movement of a regulated article when an inspector has determined that the regulated article is eligible for a limited permit in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.

(e) Any certificate or limited permit that has been issued may be withdrawn by an inspector orally, or in writing, if he or she determines that the holder of the certificate or limited permit has not complied with all conditions under this subpart for the use of the certificate or limited permit. If the withdrawal is oral, the withdrawal and the reasons for the withdrawal shall be confirmed in writing as promptly as circumstances allow. Any person whose certificate or limited permit has been withdrawn may appeal the decision in writing to the Administrator within 10 days after receiving the written notification of the withdrawal. The appeal must state all of the facts and reasons upon which the person relies to show that the certificate or limited permit was wrongfully withdrawn. As promptly as circumstances allow, the Administrator will grant or deny the appeal, in writing, stating the reasons for the decision. A hearing will be held to resolve any conflict as to any material fact. Rules of practice concerning such a hearing will be adopted by the Administrator.
