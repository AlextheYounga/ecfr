##### ยง 301.91-3 Regulated areas. #####

(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the Deputy Administrator shall list as a regulated area in paragraph (c) of this section, the State, or any portion thereof, in which European larch canker has been found by an inspector or in which the Deputy Administrator has reason to believe that European larch canker is present, or any portion of a quarantined State which the Deputy Administrator deems necessary to regulate because of its proximity to a European larch canker infestation or its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purpose from localities in which European larch canker occurs. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator determines that:

(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and

(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the artifical interstate spread of European larch canker.

(b) The Deputy Administrator or an inspector may temporarily designate any nonregulated area in a quarantined State as a regulated area in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for listing such area. Written notice of such designation shall be given to the owner or person in possession of such nonregulated area, and, thereafter, the interstate movement of any regulated article from such area shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such area shall be added to the list in paragraph (c) of this section or such designation shall be terminated by the Deputy Administrator or an inspector, and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the area.

(c) The areas described below are designated as regulated areas:
