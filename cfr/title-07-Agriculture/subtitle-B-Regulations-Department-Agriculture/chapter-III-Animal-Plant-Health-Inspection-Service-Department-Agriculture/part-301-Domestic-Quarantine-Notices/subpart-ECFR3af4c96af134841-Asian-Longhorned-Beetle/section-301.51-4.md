(1) With a certificate or limited permit issued and attached in accordance with §§ 301.51-5 and 301.51-8;

(2) Without a certificate or limited permit if:

(i) The regulated article is moved by the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes; or

(ii) The regulated article originates outside the quarantined area and is moved interstate through the quarantined area under the following conditions:

(A) The points of origin and destination are indicated on a waybill accompanying the regulated article; and

(B) The regulated article is moved through the quarantined area without stopping, or has been stored, packed, or handled at locations approved by an inspector as not posing a risk of infestation by Asian longhorned beetle; and

(C) The article has not been combined or commingled with other articles so as to lose its individual identity.

(b) When an inspector has probable cause to believe a person or means of conveyance is moving a regulated article interstate, the inspector is authorized to stop the person or means of conveyance to determine whether a regulated article is present and to inspect the regulated article. Articles found to be infected by an inspector, and articles not in compliance with the regulations in this subpart, may be seized, quarantined, treated, subjected to other remedial measures, destroyed, or otherwise disposed of.
