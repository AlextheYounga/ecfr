(a) *Regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.* The Deputy Administrator shall list as regulated areas, in a supplemental regulation designated as § 301.85-2a, each quarantined State; or each portion thereof in which golden nematode has been found or in which there is reason to believe that golden nematode is present, or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area or a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in § 301.85-1. Less than an entire quarantined State will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion that:

(1) The State has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulation which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and

(2) The designation of less than the entire State as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of the golden nematode.

(b) *Temporary designation of regulated areas and suppressive or generally infested areas.* The Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector may temporarily designate any other premises in a quarantined State as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area, in accordance with the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section for listing such area, by serving written notice thereof on the owner or person in possession of such premises, and thereafter the interstate movement of regulated articles from such premises by any person having notice of the designation shall be subject to the applicable provisions of this subpart. As soon as practicable, such premises shall be added to the list in § 301.85-2a if a basis then exists for their designation; otherwise the designation shall be terminated by the Deputy Administrator or an authorized inspector and notice thereof shall be given to the owner or person in possession of the premises.

(c) *Termination of designation as a regulated area and a suppressive or generally infested area.* The Deputy Administrator shall terminate the designation provided for under paragraph (a) of this section of any area listed as a regulated area and suppressive or generally infested area when he determines that such designation is no longer required under the criteria specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(d) *Exemption of articles from certification, permit, or other requirements.* The Deputy Administrator may, in a supplemental regulation designated as § 301.85-2b, list regulated articles or movements of regulated articles which shall be exempt from the certification, permit, or other requirements of this subpart under such conditions as he or she may prescribe, if he or she finds that facts exist as to the pest risk involved in the movement of such regulated articles which make it safe to so relieve such requirements.
