##### ยง 331.3 PPQ select agents and toxins. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, the Administrator has determined that the biological agents and toxins listed in this section have been determined to have the potential to pose a severe threat to plant health or to plant products.

(b) PPQ select agents and toxins:

*Peronosclerospora philippinensis* (*Peronosclerospora sacchari*);*Phoma glycinicola* (formerly *Pyrenochaeta glycines*);*Ralstonia solanacearum;**Rathayibacter toxicus;j**Sclerophthora rayssiae;**Synchytrium endobioticum;**Xanthomonas oryzae.*

(c) Genetic elements, recombinant and/or synthetic nucleic acids, and recombinant and/or synthetic organisms:

(1) Nucleic acids that can produce infectious forms of any of the select agent viruses listed in paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) Recombinant and/or synthetic nucleic acids that encode for the functional forms of any toxin listed in paragraph (b) of this section if the nucleic acids:

(i) Can be expressed *in vivo* or *in vitro*; or

(ii) Are in a vector or recombinant host genome and can be expressed *in vivo* or *in vitro.*

(3) Select agents and toxins listed in paragraph (b) of this section that have been genetically modified.

(d) Select agents or toxins that meet any of the following criteria are excluded from the requirements of this part:

(1) Any select agent or toxin that is in its naturally occurring environment, provided that the agent or toxin has not been intentionally introduced, cultivated, collected, or otherwise extracted from its natural source.

(2) Nonviable select agents or nonfunctional toxins.

(3) Any subspecies of *Ralstonia solanacearum* except race 3, biovar 2 and all subspecies of *Sclerophthora rayssiae* except var. *zeae,* provided that the individual or entity can identify that the agent is within the exclusion category.

(e) An attenuated strain of a select agent or a select toxin modified to be less potent or toxic may be excluded from the requirements of this part based upon a determination by the Administrator that the attenuated strain or modified toxin does not pose a severe threat to plant health or plant products.

(1) To apply for exclusion, an individual or entity must submit a written request and supporting scientific information. A written decision granting or denying the request will be issued. An exclusion will be effective upon notification to the applicant. Exclusions will be listed on the National Select Agent Registry Web site at *http://www.selectagents.gov/.*

(2) If an excluded attenuated strain or modified toxin is subjected to any manipulation that restores or enhances its virulence or toxic activity, the resulting select agent or toxin will be subject to the requirements of this part.

(f) Any select agent or toxin seized by a Federal law enforcement agency will be excluded from the requirements of this part during the period between seizure of the agent or toxin and the transfer or destruction of such agent or toxin provided that:

(1) As soon as practicable, the Federal law enforcement agency transfers the seized agent or toxin to an entity eligible to receive such agent or toxin or destroys the agent or toxin by a recognized sterilization or inactivation process.

(2) The Federal law enforcement agency safeguards and secures the seized agent or toxin against theft, loss, or release, and reports any theft, loss, or release of such agent or toxin.

(3) The Federal law enforcement agency reports the seizure of the select agent or toxin to APHIS or CDC. The seizure must be reported within 24 hours by telephone, facsimile, or e-mail. This report must be followed by submission of APHIS/CDC Form 4 within 7 calendar days after seizure of the select agent or toxin. A copy of the completed form must be maintained for 3 years.

(4) The Federal law enforcement agency reports the final disposition of the select agent or toxin to APHIS or CDC by submission of APHIS/CDC Form 4. A copy of the completed form must be maintained for 3 years.
