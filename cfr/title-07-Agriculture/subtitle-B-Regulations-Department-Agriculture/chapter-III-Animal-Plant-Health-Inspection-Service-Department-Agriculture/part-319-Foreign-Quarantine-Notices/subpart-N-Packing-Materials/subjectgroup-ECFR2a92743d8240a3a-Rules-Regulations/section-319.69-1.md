##### § 319.69-1 Definitions. #####

(a) *Packing materials.* The expression “packing material”, as used in § 319.69, includes any of the plants or plant products enumerated, when these are associated with or accompany any commodity or shipment to serve for filling, wrapping, ties, lining, mats, moisture retention, protection, or for any other purpose; and the word “packing”, as used in the expression “packing materials”, shall include the presence of such materials within, in contact with, or accompanying such commodity or shipment. 1

(b) *Inspector.* An inspector of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
