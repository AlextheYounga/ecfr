##### § 319.56-36 Watermelon, squash, cucumber, and oriental melon from the Republic of Korea. #####

Watermelon (*Citrullus lanatus*), squash (*Cucurbita maxima*), cucumber (*Cucumis sativus*), and oriental melon (*Cucumis melo*) may be imported into the United States from the Republic of Korea only in accordance with this paragraph and all other applicable provisions of this subpart:

(a) The fruit must be grown in pest-proof greenhouses registered with the Republic of Korea's national plant protection organization (NPPO).

(b) The NPPO must inspect and regularly monitor greenhouses for plant pests. The NPPO must inspect greenhouses and plants, including fruit, at intervals of no more than 2 weeks, from the time of fruit set until the end of harvest.

(c) The NPPO must set and maintain McPhail traps (or a similar type with a protein bait that has been approved for the pests of concern) in greenhouses from October 1 to April 30. The number of traps must be set as follows: Two traps for greenhouses smaller than 0.2 hectare in size; three traps for greenhouses 0.2 to 0.5 hectare; four traps for greenhouses over 0.5 hectare and up to 1.0 hectare; and for greenhouses greater than 1 hectare, traps must be placed at a rate of four traps per hectare.

(d) The NPPO must check all traps once every 2 weeks. If a single pumpkin fruit fly is captured, that greenhouse will lose its registration until trapping shows that the infestation has been eradicated.

(e) The fruit may be shipped only from December 1 through April 30.

(f) Each consignment must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by NPPO, with the following additional declaration: “The regulated articles in this consignment were grown in registered greenhouses as specified by 7 CFR 319.56-36.”

(g) Each consignment must be protected from pest infestation from harvest until export. Newly harvested fruit must be covered with insect-proof mesh or a plastic tarpaulin while moving to the packinghouse and awaiting packing. Fruit must be packed within 24 hours of harvesting in an enclosed container or vehicle or in insect-proof cartons or cartons covered with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin, and then placed in containers for shipment. These safeguards must be intact when the consignment arrives at the port in the United States.
