Fresh sand pears (*Pyrus pyrifolia*) from China may be imported into the United States from China only under the conditions described in this section. These conditions are designed to prevent the introduction of the following quarantine pests: *Acrobasis pyrivorella,* pear fruit moth; *Alternaria gaisen* Nagano, the cause of black spot of sand pear; *Amphitetranychus viennensis* (Zacher), Hawthorn spider mite; *Aphanostigma iaksuiense* (Kishida), an aphid; *Bactrocera dorsalis,* Oriental fruit fly; *Caleptrimerus neimongolensis* Kuang and Geng, a mite; *Carposina sasakii* Matsumora, peach fruit moth; *Ceroplastes japonicus* Green, Japanese wax scale; *Ceroplastes rubens* Maskell, red wax scale; *Conogothes punctiferalis* (Guenée), yellow peach moth; *Grapholita inopinata,* Manchurian fruit moth; *Guignardia* pyricola (Nose) W. Yamamoto, a phytopathogenic fungus; *Monilinia fructigena* Honey in Whetzel, the cause of brown fruit rot; *Phenacoccus pergandei* Cockerell, a mealybug; *Planococcus kraunhiae* (Kuwana), a mealybug; and *Venturia nashicola* Tanaka and Yamamoto, pear scab fungus. The conditions for importation of all fresh sand pears from China are found in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section; additional conditions for sand pears imported from areas of China south of the 33rd parallel are found in paragraph (f) of this section.

(a) *General requirements.* (1) The national plant protection organization (NPPO) of China must provide an operational workplan to APHIS that details the activities that the NPPO of China will, subject to APHIS' approval of the workplan, carry out to meet the requirements of this section.

(2) The pears must be grown at places of production that are registered with the NPPO of China.

(3) The pears must be packed for export to the United States in pest-exclusionary packinghouses that are registered with the NPPO of China.

(4) Sand pears from China may be imported in commercial consignments only.

(b) *Place of production requirements.* (1) All propagative material entering a registered place of production must be tested and certified by the NPPO of China as being free of quarantine pests.

(2) The place of production must carry out any phytosanitary measures specified for the place of production under the operational workplan.

(3) When any sand pears destined for export to the United States are still on the tree and are no more than 2.5 centimeters in diameter, double-layered paper bags must be placed wholly over the pears. The bags must remain intact and on the pears until the pears arrive at the packinghouse.

(4) The NPPO of China must visit and inspect registered places of production prior to harvest for signs of infestations and allow APHIS to monitor the inspections. The NPPO must provide records of pest detections and pest detection practices to APHIS, and APHIS must approve these practices.

(5) If any of the quarantine pests listed in the introductory text of this section is detected at a registered place of production, APHIS may reject the consignment or prohibit the importation into the United States of sand pears from the place of production for the remainder of the season. The exportation to the United States of sand pears from the place of production may resume in the next growing season if an investigation is conducted and APHIS and the NPPO conclude that appropriate remedial action has been taken.

(c) *Packinghouse requirements.* (1) During the time registered packinghouses are in use for packing sand pears for export to the United States, the packinghouses may only accept sand pears that are from registered places of production and that are produced in accordance with the requirements of this section.

(2) Packinghouses must have a tracking system in place to readily identify all sand pears that enter the packinghouse destined for export to the United States back to their place of production.

(3) The NPPO of China or officials authorized by the NPPO must inspect the pears for signs of pest infestation and allow APHIS to monitor the inspections. If any of the quarantine pests listed in the introductory text of this section is detected in a consignment at the packinghouse, APHIS may reject the consignment.

(4) Following the inspection, the packinghouse must follow a handling procedure for the pears that is mutually agreed upon by APHIS and the NPPO of China.

(5) The pears must be packed in cartons that are labeled with the identity of the place of production and the packinghouse.

(6) The cartons must be placed in insect-proof containers, and the containers sealed. The containers of sand pears must be safeguarded during transport to the United States in a manner that will prevent pest infestation.

(d) *Shipping requirements.* Sealed containers of sand pears destined for export to the United States must be held in a cold storage facility while awaiting export.

(e) *Phytosanitary certificate.* Each consignment of sand pears imported from China into the United States must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO of China with an additional declaration stating that the requirements of this section have been met and the consignment has been inspected and found free of quarantine pests.

(f) *Additional conditions for sand pears from areas of China south of the 33rd parallel.* In addition to the conditions in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section, sand pears from areas of China south of the 33rd parallel must meet the following conditions for importation into the United States:

(1) The place of production of the pears and the packinghouse in which they are packed must have a trapping system in place for *B. dorsalis.* At a minimum, the trapping system must meet the requirements of the operational work plan.

(2) The place of production or the packinghouse must retain data regarding the number and location of the traps, as well as any pests other than *B. dorsalis* that have been caught, and make this information available to APHIS upon request.

(3)(i) The place of production or packinghouse must notify the NPPO of China, and the NPPO of China must notify APHIS, regarding the detection of a single *B. dorsalis* in a place of production, packinghouse, or surrounding area within 48 hours of the detection.

(ii) If a single *B. dorsalis* is detected in a registered place of production, APHIS will prohibit the importation into the United States of sand pears from the place of production until any mitigation measures determined by APHIS to be necessary to prevent future infestations are taken.

(iii) If a single *B. dorsalis* is detected in a registered packinghouse, the packinghouse may not be used to pack sand pears for export to the United States until any mitigation measures determined by APHIS to be necessary to prevent future infestations are taken.

(4) The pears must be treated in accordance with 7 CFR part 305 and the operational workplan.
