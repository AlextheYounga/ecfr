##### § 319.56-42 Peppers from the Republic of Korea. #####

Peppers (*Capsicum annuum* L. var. *annuum*) from the Republic of Korea may be imported into the continental United States only under the following conditions and in accordance with all other applicable provisions of this subpart:

(a) The peppers must be grown in the Republic of Korea in insect-proof greenhouses approved by and registered with the National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS).

(b) The greenhouses must be equipped with double self-closing doors, and any vents or openings in the greenhouses (other than the double self-closing doors) must be covered with 0.6 mm screening in order to prevent the entry of pests into the greenhouse.

(c) The greenhouses must be inspected monthly throughout the growing season by NPQS to ensure phytosanitary procedures are employed to exclude plant pests and diseases, and that the screens are intact.

(d) The peppers must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a pest-exclusionary packinghouse. During the time the packinghouse is in use for exporting peppers to the continental United States, the packinghouse can accept peppers only from registered approved production sites. The peppers must be safeguarded by an insect-proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit from the production site to the packinghouse and while awaiting packing. The peppers must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers, or covered with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin, for transit to the continental United States. These safeguards must remain intact until the arrival of the peppers in the United States or the consignment will not be allowed to enter the United States.

(e) Each consignment of peppers must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate of inspection issued by NPQS bearing the following additional declaration: “These peppers were grown in greenhouses in accordance with the conditions in 7 CFR 319.56-42 and were inspected and found free from *Agrotis segetum, Helicoverpa armigera, Helicoverpa assulta, Mamestra brassicae, Monilinia fructigena, Ostrinia furnacalis, Scirtothrips dorsalis, Spodoptera litura,* and *Thrips palmi.*”

(f) The peppers must be imported in commercial consignments only.
