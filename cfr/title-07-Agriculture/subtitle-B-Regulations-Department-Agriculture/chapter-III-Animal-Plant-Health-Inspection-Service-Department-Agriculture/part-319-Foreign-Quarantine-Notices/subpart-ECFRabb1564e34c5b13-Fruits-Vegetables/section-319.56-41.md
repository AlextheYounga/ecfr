##### § 319.56-41 Citrus from Peru. #####

Grapefruit (*Citrus paradisi*), limes (*C. aurantiifolia*), mandarins or tangerines (*C. reticulata*), sweet oranges (*C. sinensis*), and tangelos (*Citrus tangelo*) may be imported into the continental United States from Peru under the following conditions:

(a) The fruit must be accompanied by a permit issued in accordance with § 319.56-3(b).

(b) The fruit may be imported in commercial consignments only.

(c) *Grower registration and agreement.* The production site where the fruit is grown must be registered for export with the national plant protection organization (NPPO) of Peru, and the producer must have signed an agreement with the NPPO of Peru whereby the producer agrees to participate in and follow the fruit fly management program established by the NPPO of Peru.

(d) *Management program for fruit flies; monitoring.* The NPPO of Peru's fruit fly management program must be approved by APHIS, and must require that participating citrus producers allow APHIS inspectors access to production areas in order to monitor compliance with the fruit fly management program. The fruit fly management program must also provide for the following:

(1) *Trapping and control.* In areas where citrus is produced for export to the United States, traps must be placed in fruit fly host plants at least 6 weeks prior to harvest at a rate mutually agreed upon by APHIS and the NPPO of Peru. If fruit fly trapping levels at a production site exceed the thresholds established by APHIS and the NPPO of Peru, exports from that production site will be suspended until APHIS and the NPPO of Peru conclude that fruit fly population levels have been reduced to an acceptable limit. Fruit fly traps are monitored weekly; therefore, reinstatements of production sites will be evaluated on a weekly basis.

(2) *Records.* The NPPO of Peru or its designated representative must keep records that document the fruit fly trapping and control activities in areas that produce citrus for export to the United States. All trapping and control records kept by the NPPO of Peru or its designated representative must be made available to APHIS upon request.

(e) *Cold treatment.* The fruit, except for limes (*C. aurantiifolia*), must be cold treated for A*nastrepha fraterculus, A. obliqua, A. serpentina,* and *Ceratitis capitata* (Mediterranean fruit fly) in accordance with part 305 of this chapter.

(f) *Phytosanitary inspection.* Each consignment of fruit must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO of Peru stating that the fruit has been inspected and found free of *Ecdytolopha aurantiana.*

(g) *Port of first arrival sampling.* Citrus fruits imported from Peru are subject to inspection by an inspector at the port of first arrival into the United States in accordance with § 319.56-3(d). At the port of first arrival, an inspector will sample and cut citrus fruits from each consignment to detect pest infestation. If a single live fruit fly in any stage of development or a single *E. aurantiana* is found, the consignment will be held until an investigation is completed and appropriate remedial actions have been implemented.
