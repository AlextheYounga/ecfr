##### § 319.37-4 Inspection, treatment, and phytosanitary certificates of inspection. #####

(a) *Phytosanitary certificates of inspection.* Any restricted article offered for importation into the United States must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate, unless the article is explicitly exempted from this requirement in the paragraphs below. The phytosanitary certificate must identify the genus of the article it accompanies. When the regulations in this subpart place restrictions on individual species or cultivars within a genus, the phytosanitary certificate must also identify the species or cultivar of the article it accompanies. If the plant is grafted, budded, or otherwise contains interpolated plant parts, the phytosanitary certificate must list the identity of any plant parts (*e.g.,* scion, rootstock, or interstem) that belong to restricted taxa to the lowest regulated taxon, *e.g.,* genus, species, or cultivar. Otherwise, identification of the species is strongly preferred, but not required. Intergeneric and interspecific hybrids must be designated by placing the multiplication sign “x” between the names of the parent taxa.

(1) Greenhouse-grown plants from Canada imported in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. These plants must be accompanied by a certificate of inspection in the form of a label in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section attached to each carton of the articles and to an airway bill, bill of lading, or delivery ticket accompanying the articles.

(2) Small lots of seed imported in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.

(3) Seeds from Canada imported in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. Each carton of seed must be labeled as required by paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section. Each shipment of seed must be accompanied by the documents in paragraphs (e)(2)(iii)(A) and (e)(2)(iii)(B) of this section, as necessary.

(4) Small packages of bulbs offered to travelers returning from the Netherlands accompanied by a special certificate that lists a serial number, the scientific name of the bulb, the country of its origin, and a date on which the special certificate expires. The serial number must refer to a phytosanitary certificate issued, held, and retrievable upon request by the national plant protection organization of the Netherlands. The expiration date must be within 6 weeks after the issuance of the phytosanitary certificate held by the national plant protection organization of the Netherlands. Shipments of bulbs from the Netherlands accompanied by this certificate may be imported into the United States without preclearance by APHIS.

(b) *Inspection and treatment.* Any restricted article must be presented for inspection by an inspector at the port of first arrival and/or under preclearance inspection arrangements in the country in which the article was grown, and must undergo any treatment contained in part 305 of this chapter that is ordered by the inspector. Any restricted article found upon inspection to contain or be contaminated with plant pests, that cannot be eliminated by treatment, shall be denied entry at the first United States port of arrival.

(c) *Greenhouse-grown plants from Canada.* With the exception of *Fraxinus* spp. (ash) plants, a greenhouse-grown restricted plant may be imported from Canada if the Plant Health and Production Division of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) signs a written agreement with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service allowing such importation, and provided that the following conditions are met:

(1) The Plant Health and Production Division of CFIA shall:

(i) Eliminate individual inspections and phytosanitary certification of each shipment of articles exported in accordance with this section;

(ii) Enter into written agreements with, and assign a unique identification number to, each greenhouse grower participating in the greenhouse program;

(iii) Inspect greenhouses and the plants being grown in them using inspection methods and schedules approved by Plant Protection and Quarantine to ensure that the criteria of this subsection are met;

(iv) Issue labels to each grower participating in the program. The labels issued to each grower shall bear a unique number identifying that grower, and shall bear the following statement: “This shipment of greenhouse-grown plants meets the import requirements of the United States, and is believed to be free from injurious plant pests. Issued by Plant Health and Production Division, Canadian Food Inspection Agency.” The Plant Health and Production Division, CFIA, shall also ensure that the label is placed on the airway bill, bill of lading, or delivery ticket accompanying each shipment of articles; and

(v) Ensure that only plants that are not excluded shipment by the criteria of this subsection are shipped.

(2) Each greenhouse grower participating in the program shall enter into an agreement with the Plant Health and Production Division of CFIA in which the grower agrees to:

(i) Maintain records of the kinds and quantities of plants grown in their greenhouses, including the date of receipt and place of origin of the plants; keep the records for at least 1 year after the plants are shipped to the United States; and make the records available for review and copying upon request by either the Plant Health and Production Division of CFIA or an authorized representative of the Secretary of Agriculture;

(ii) Apply to an airway bill, bill of lading, or delivery ticket for plants to be shipped to the United States a label issued by CFIA that includes the identification number assigned to the grower by the Plant Health and Production Division, CFIA, and the following certification statement: “This shipment of greenhouse grown plants meets the import requirements of the United States and is believed to be free from injurious plant pests. Issued by Plant Health and Production Division, Canadian Food inspection Agency.”; and

(iii) Use pest control practices approved by Plant Protection and Quarantine and the Plant Health and Production Division of CFIA to exclude pests from the greenhouses.

(d) *Small lots of seed.* Lots of seed may be imported without a phytosanitary certificate required by paragraph (a) of this section under the following conditions:

(3) The seed meets the following packaging and shipping requirements:

(i) Each seed packet is clearly labeled with the name of the collector/shipper, the country of origin, and the scientific name at least to the genus, and preferably to the species, level;

(ii) There are a maximum of 50 seeds of 1 taxon (taxonomic category such as genus, species, cultivar, etc.) per packet; or a maximum weight not to exceed 10 grams of seed of 1 taxon per packet;
