(c) *State Postentry quarantine agreement.* (1) Articles required to undergo postentry quarantine in accordance with this section may only be imported if destined for postentry quarantine growing in a State which has entered into a written agreement with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, signed by the Administrator or his or her designee and by the State Plant Regulatory Official. In accordance with the laws of individual States, inspection and other postentry quarantine services provided by a State may be subject to charges imposed by the State.

(i) The following States have entered into a postentry quarantine agreement in accordance with this paragraph: All U.S. States and Territories.

(ii) [Reserved]

(2) In any such written agreement, the State shall agree to:

(i) Establish State regulations and requirements prior to the effective date of the agreement and enforce such regulations and requirements necessary to inspect sites and plants growing in postentry quarantine and to monitor and enforce compliance with postentry quarantine growing in accordance with this section;

(ii) Review pending permit applications for articles to be grown under postentry quarantine conditions in the State, upon request of Plant Protection and Quarantine, and report to the National Postentry Quarantine Coordinator of Plant Protection and Quarantine whether the State would be able to provide inspection and monitoring services for the proposed postentry quarantine;

(iii) Provide the services of State inspectors to: inspect sites to be used for postentry quarantine; report to the National Postentry Quarantine Coordinator of Plant Protection and Quarantine whether the site is of adequate size to contain the number of plants proposed for importation, including potential increase if increase is allowed; inspect plants for evidence of quarantine pests at least once during the first year and once during the second year for plants required to be grown in postentry quarantine for 2 years, and at least once for plants required to be grown in quarantine for less than 2 years; and monitor and enforce compliance with the requirements of this section during the use of the sites for postentry quarantine;

(iv) Report to the National Postentry Quarantine Coordinatorof Plant Protection and Quarantine any evidence of quarantine pests that are found at a postentry quarantine site by State inspectors; recommend to Plant Protection and Quarantine safeguards or mitigation measures to control the pests; and supervise the application of safeguards or mitigation measures approved by Plant Protection and Quarantine; and

(v) Report to the National Postentry Quarantine Coordinatorof Plant Protection and Quarantine any propagation or increase in the number of plants that occurs during postentry quarantine.

(3) In any such written agreement, the Administrator shall agree to:

(i) Seek State review of permit applications for postentry quarantine material in that State, and issue permits only after determining that State services are available to monitor the postentry quarantine;

(ii) Upon request of the State, provide training, technical advice, and pest identification services to State officials involved in providing postentry quarantine services in accordance with this section;

(iii) Notify State officials, in writing and within ten days of the arrival, when plant material destined for postentry quarantine in their State arrives in the United States, and notify State officials in writing when materials in postentry quarantine may be released from quarantine in their State.

(4) *Termination of State postentry quarantine agreement.* A State postentry quarantine agreement may be terminated by either the Administrator or the State Plant Regulatory Official by giving written notice of termination to the other party. The effective date of the termination will be 60 days after the date of actual receipt of notice, with regard to future importation to that State of articles requiring postentry quarantine in accordance with this section. When a postentry quarantine agreement is terminated by either the State Plant Regulatory Official or the Administrator, APHIS and the affected State shall continue to provide postentry quarantine services in accordance with the postentry quarantine agreement, until the time the plant material is eligible to be released from quarantine, for all postentry quarantine material already in the State, and for all postentry quarantine material that arrives in the State prior to the effective date of termination.

(d) *Postentry quarantine growing agreements.* Any restricted article required to be grown under postentry quarantine conditions, as well as any increase therefrom, shall be grown in accordance with a postentry quarantine growing agreement signed by the person (the importer) applying for a controlled import permit in accordance with § 319.6 for importation of the article and submitted to Plant Protection and Quarantine. On each postentry quarantine growing agreement, APHIS shall also obtain the signature of the State Plant Regulatory Official for the State in which regulated articles covered by the agreement will be grown. The postentry quarantine growing agreement shall specify the kind, number, and origin of plants to be imported, and shall certify to APHIS and to the State in which the articles are grown that the signer of the agreement will comply with the following conditions for the period of time specified below:

(f) *Inspector-ordered disposal, movement, or safeguarding of restricted articles; costs and charges, civil and criminal liabilities* - (1) *Growing at unauthorized sites.* If an inspector determines that any article subject to the postentry quarantine growing requirements of this section, or any increase therefrom, is being grown at an unauthorized site, the inspector may file an emergency action notification (PPQ form 523) with the owner of the article or the person who owns or is in possession of the site on which the article is being grown. The person named in the form 523 must, within the time specified in form 523, sign a postentry quarantine growing agreement, destroy, ship to a point outside the United States, move to an authorized postentry quarantine site, and/or apply treatments or other safeguards to the article, the increase therefrom, or any portion of the article or the increase therefrom, as prescribed by an inspector to prevent the introduction of quarantine pests into the United States. In choosing which action to order and in setting the time limit for the action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented by the quarantine pest(s) associated with the kind of article (including increase therefrom), the types of other host materials for the pest in or near the growing site, the climate and season at the site in relation to the pest's survival, and the availability of treatment facilities.

(2) *Growing at authorized sites.* If an inspector determines that any article, or any increase therefrom, grown at a site specified in an authorized postentry quarantine growing agreement is being grown contrary to the provisions of this section, including in numbers greater than the number approved by the postentry quarantine growing agreement, or in a manner that otherwise presents a risk of introducing quarantine pests into the United States, the inspector shall issue an emergency action notification (PPQ form 523) to the person who signed the postentry quarantine growing agreement. That person shall be responsible for carrying out all actions specified in the emergency action notification. The emergency action notification may extend the time for which the articles and the increase therefrom must be grown under the postentry quarantine conditions specified in the authorized postentry quarantine growing agreement, or may require that the person named in the notification must destroy, ship to a point outside the United States, or apply treatments or other safeguards to the article, the increase therefrom, or any portion of the article or the increase therefrom, within the time specified in the emergency action notification. In choosing which action to order and in setting the time limit for the action, the inspector shall consider the degree of pest risk presented by the quarantine pest(s) associated with the kind of article (including increase therefrom), the types of other host materials for the pest in or near the growing site, the climate and season at the site in relation to the pest's survival, and the availability of treatment facilities.

(3) *Costs and charges.* All costs pursuant to any action ordered by an inspector in accordance with this section shall be borne by the person who signed the postentry quarantine growing agreement covering the site where the articles were grown, or if no such agreement was signed, by the owner of the articles at the growing site.

(4) *Civil and criminal liabilities.* Any person who moves an article subject to postentry quarantine growing requirements from the site specified for that article in an authorized postentry quarantine growing agreement, or who otherwise handles such an article contrary to the requirements of this section, shall be subject to such civil penalties and such criminal liabilities as are provided by 18 U.S.C. 1001, 7 U.S.C. 7734, or other applicable Federal statutes.
