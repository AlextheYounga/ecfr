##### § 319.56-67 Cape gooseberry from Colombia. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 46639, Sept. 14, 2018.

Cape gooseberry (*Physalis peruviana*) may be imported into the United States from Colombia in accordance with the conditions described in this section. These conditions are designed to prevent the introduction of *Ceratitis capitata.*

(a) *Workplan.* The national plant protection organization (NPPO) of Colombia must provide a bilateral workplan to APHIS that details the activities that the NPPO will, subject to APHIS' approval, carry out to meet the requirements of this section. APHIS will be directly involved with the NPPO in the monitoring and auditing implementation of the systems approach.

(b) *Places of production.* (1) All places of production must be registered with the NPPO of Colombia.

(2) All places of production must be located within the *C. capitata* low prevalence area of the Bogota Savannah and the neighboring municipalities above 2,200 meters in the Departments of Boyacá and Cundinamarca.

(c) *Mitigation measures for C. capitata.* (1) Trapping for *C. capitata* must be conducted in the places of production in accordance with the bilateral workplan to demonstrate that those places are free of *C. capitata.* Specific trapping requirements must be included in the bilateral workplan. The NPPO of Colombia must keep records of fruit fly detections for each trap and make the records available to APHIS upon request.

(2) All fruit flies trapped must be reported to APHIS immediately. Capture of *C. capitata* will result in immediate cancellation of exports from farms within a 5 kilometer radius (78.54 square kilometers) of the detection site. An additional 50 traps must be placed within an area with a 1.26 kilometer radius (5 square kilometers) surrounding the detection site. If a second detection is made within 30 days of a previous capture, eradication using a bait spray agreed upon by APHIS and the NPPO of Colombia must be initiated in the detection area. Treatment must continue for at least 2 months. Exports may resume from the detection area when APHIS and the NPPO of Colombia agree the risk has been mitigated.

(d) *Post-harvest procedures.* The cape gooseberry must be packed in boxes marked with the identity of the originating farm. The boxes must be packed in sealed and closed containers before being shipped.

(e) *Phytosanitary inspection.* After packing, the NPPO of Colombia must visually inspect a biometric sample of cape gooseberry at a rate jointly approved by APHIS and the NPPO of Colombia, and cut open the sampled fruit to detect *C. capitata.*

(f) *Commercial consignments.* The cape gooseberry must be imported in commercial consignments only.

(g) *Phytosanitary certificate.* Each consignment of cape gooseberry must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the NPPO of Colombia containing an additional declaration stating that the fruit originated from a place of production free of *C. capitata* within the low prevalence area of Bogota Savannah and the neighboring municipalities above 2,200 meters of elevation in the Departments of Boyacá and Cundinamarca and was produced in accordance with the requirements of § 319.56-67.
