Grapes (*Vitis* spp.) may be imported into the United States from the Republic of Korea only under the following conditions and in accordance with all other applicable provisions of this subpart:

(a) The fields where the grapes are grown must be inspected during the growing season by the Republic of Korea's national plant protection organization (NPPO). The NPPO will inspect 250 grapevines per hectare, inspecting leaves, stems, and fruit of the vines.

(b) If evidence of *Conogethes punctiferalis, Eupoecilia ambiguella, Sparganothis pilleriana, Stathmopoda auriferella,* or *Monilinia fructigena* is detected during inspection, the field will immediately be rejected, and exports from that field will be canceled until visual inspection of the vines shows that the infestation has been eradicated.

(c) Fruit must be bagged from the time the fruit sets until harvest.

(d) Each consignment must be inspected by the NPPO before export. For each consignment, the NPPO must issue a phytosanitary certificate with an additional declaration stating that the fruit in the consignment was found free of *C. punctiferalis, E. ambiguella, S. pilleriana, S. auriferella, M. fructigena,* and *Nippoptilia vitis.*
