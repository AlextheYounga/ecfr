##### § 319.56-73 Peppers From Peru. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 46639, Sept. 14, 2018.

Fresh peppers (*Capsicum annum* L., *Capsicum baccatum* L., *Capsicum chinense* Jacq., *Capsicum frutescens* L., and *Capsicum pubescens* Ruiz & Pav.) may be imported into the continental United States and its Territories only under the conditions described in this section. These conditions are designed to prevent the introduction of the following quarantine pests: *Anastrepha fraterculus* (Wiedemann), South American fruit fly; *Ceratitis capitata* (Wiedemann), Mediterranean fruit fly; *Neoleucinodes elegantalis* (Guenée), a fruit boring moth; and *Puccinia pampeana* Speg., a pathogenic fungus that causes pepper and green pepper rust.

(a) *Operational workplan.* The national plant protection organization (NPPO) of Peru must provide an operational workplan to APHIS that details the activities that the NPPO of Peru will, subject to APHIS' approval of the workplan, carry out to meet the requirements of this section. The operational workplan must include and describe the quarantine pest survey intervals and other specific requirements as set forth in this section.

(b) *Commercial consignments.* Peppers from Peru may be imported in commercial consignments only.

(c) *Production site requirements.* (1) Pepper production sites must consist of pest-exclusionary structures, which must have double self-closing doors and have all other windows, openings, and vents covered with 1.6 mm (or less) screening.

(2) All production sites that participate in the export program must be registered with the Peruvian NPPO.

(3) The production sites must be inspected prior to harvest for *Neoleucinodes elegantalis* (Guenée) and *Puccinia pampeana* Speg. If either of these pests, or other quarantine pests, are found to be generally infesting or infecting the production site, the NPPO of Peru will immediately prohibit that production site from exporting peppers to the continental United States and its Territories and notify APHIS of this action. The prohibition will remain in effect until the Peruvian NPPO and APHIS determine that the pest risk has been mitigated.

(4) The production sites must contain traps for the detection of *Anastrepha fraterculus* (Wiedemann) and *Ceratitis capitata* (Wiedemann) both within and around the structures. Internal traps must be set for the duration of the time the production site is used to produce peppers for export to the continental United States or the Territories. External traps must be set for at least 2 months before export and trapping must continue to the end of the harvest as follows:

(i) Traps with an approved protein bait must be placed inside the production site at a density of four traps per hectare, with a minimum of two traps per structure. Traps must be serviced once every 7 days.

(ii) If a single *Anastrepha fraterculus* (Wiedemann) or *Ceratitis capitata* (Wiedemann) is detected inside a registered production site or in a consignment, the registered production site will lose its ability to export peppers to the continental United States or its Territories until APHIS and the Peruvian NPPO mutually determine that risk mitigation is achieved.

(iii) Traps with an approved protein bait must be placed inside a buffer area 500 meters wide around the registered production site, at a density of 1 trap per 10 hectares and a minimum of 10 traps. These traps must be checked at least once every 7 days. At least one of these traps must be near the production site.

(iv) Capture of 0.7 or more *Anastrepha fraterculus* (Wiedemann) or *Ceratitis capitata* (Wiedemann) per trap per week will delay or suspend the harvest, depending on whether harvest has begun, for consignments of peppers from that registered production site until APHIS and the Peruvian NPPO can agree that the pest risk has been mitigated.

(v) The Peruvian NPPO must maintain records of trap placement, checking of traps, and any quarantine pest captures. The Peruvian NPPO must maintain an APHIS-approved quality control program to monitor or audit the trapping program. The trapping records must be maintained for APHIS review.

(d) *Packinghouse procedures.* (1) All packinghouses that participate in the export program must be registered with the Peruvian NPPO.

(2) The peppers must be packed within 24 hours of harvest in a pest-exclusionary packinghouse. The peppers must be safeguarded by an insect-proof mesh screen or plastic tarpaulin while in transit to the packinghouse and while awaiting packing. The peppers must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers, or covered with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin, for transit into the continental United States or its Territories. These safeguards must remain intact until arrival in the continental United States or its Territories or the consignment will be denied entry into the continental United States or its Territories.

(3) During the time the packinghouse is in use for exporting peppers to the continental United States or its Territories, the packinghouse may only accept peppers from registered approved production sites.

(e) *Phytosanitary certificate.* Each consignment of peppers must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate of inspection issued by the Peruvian NPPO stating that the fruit in the consignment has been produced in accordance with the requirements of the systems approach in 7 CFR 319.56-73.
