Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 46639, Sept. 14, 2018.

Untreated grapefruit (*Citrus paradisi*), sweet oranges (*Citrus sinensis*), and tangerines (*Citrus reticulata*) may be imported into the United States from Mexico for extracting juice if they originate from production sites in Mexico that are approved by APHIS because they meet the following conditions and any other conditions determined by the Administrator to be necessary to mitigate the pest risk that such fruits pose and in accordance with all other applicable provisions of this subpart:

(a) *Application of sterile insect technique.* Production sites, and a surrounding 1.5 mile buffer area, must be administered under an APHIS-approved preventative release program using sterile insect technique for the Mexican fruit fly (*Anastrepha ludens*).

(b) *Fruit fly trapping protocol.* (1) *Trapping densities.* In areas where grapefruit, sweet oranges, and tangerines are produced for export to the United States, APHIS approved traps and lures must be placed in production sites and a surrounding 1.5 mile buffer areas as follows:

(i) For Mexican fruit fly (*Anastrepha ludens*) and sapote fruit fly (*A. serpentina*): One trap per 50 hectares.

(ii) For Mediterranean fruit fly (*Ceratitis capitata*): One to four traps per 250 hectares.

(2) *Fruit fly catches.* Upon trapping of a Mexican fruit fly, sapote fruit fly, or Mediterranean fruit fly in a production site or buffer area, exports from that production site are prohibited until the Administrator determines that the phytosanitary measures taken have been effective to allow the resumption of export from that production site.

(3) *Monitoring.* The trapping program must be monitored under an APHIS-approved quality control program.

(c) *Safeguarding.* Fruit must be safeguarded against fruit fly infestation using methods approved by APHIS from the time of harvest until processing in the United States.

(d) *Phytosanitary certificate.* Each consignment must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by Mexico's national plant protection organization that contains additional declarations stating that the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section have been met.

(e) *Ports.* The harvested fruit may enter the United States only through a port of entry located in one of the Texas counties listed in § 301.64-3(c) of this chapter.

(f) *Route of transit.* Harvested fruit must travel on the most direct route to the processing plant from its point of entry into the United States as specified in the import permit. Such fruit may not enter or transit areas other than the Texas counties listed in § 301.64-3(c) of this chapter.

(g) *Approved destinations.* Processing plants within the United States must be located within an area in Texas that is under an APHIS-approved preventative release program using sterile insect technique for Mexican fruit fly.

(h) *Compliance agreements.* Processing plants within the United States must enter into a compliance agreement with APHIS in order to handle grapefruit, sweet oranges, and tangerines imported from Mexico in accordance with this section. APHIS will only enter into compliance agreements with facilities that handle and process grapefruit, sweet oranges, and tangerines from Mexico in such a way as to eliminate any risk that exotic fruit flies could be disseminated into the United States, as determined by APHIS.
