##### § 319.56-83 Tree tomatoes from Ecuador. #####

Fresh tree tomatoes (*Solanum betaceum* Cavanilles) may be imported into the continental United States from Ecuador only under the conditions of this systems approach described in this section. These conditions are designed to prevent the introduction of the following quarantine pests: *Anastrepha fraterculus,* South American fruit fly; *Ceratitis capitata,* Mediterranean fruit fly; *Neoleucinodes elegantalis,* a moth; and the Tamarillo mosaic virus.

(a) *General requirements* - (1) *Operational workplan.* The national plant protection organization (NPPO) of Ecuador must provide an operational workplan to APHIS that details the activities that the NPPO of Ecuador will carry out to meet the requirements of this section. The operational workplan must be approved by APHIS and include and describe specific requirements as set forth in this section. APHIS will be directly involved with the NPPO of Ecuador in monitoring and auditing implementation of the systems approach.

(2) *Registered places of production.* Tree tomatoes considered for export to the continental United States must be produced at places of production that are registered with the NPPO of Ecuador.

(3) *Registered packinghouses.* Tree tomatoes must be packed for export to the continental United States in pest-exclusionary packinghouses that are registered with the NPPO of Ecuador.

(4) *Recordkeeping.* The NPPO of Ecuador must maintain all forms and documents related to export program activities in registered places of production and packinghouses for at least 1 year and provide them to APHIS upon request.

(5) *Identification.* The identity of each lot of tree tomatoes from Ecuador must be maintained throughout the export process, from the place of production until the tomatoes are released for entry into the continental United States. The means of identification that allows the lot to be traced back to the place of production in which it was produced, and the packinghouse in which it was packed, must be described in the operational workplan.

(6) *Commercial consignments.* Tree tomatoes from Ecuador may be imported in commercial consignments only.

(7) *Safeguarding.* Lots of tree tomatoes destined for export to the continental United States must be safeguarded during movement from registered places of production to registered packinghouses, and from registered packinghouses to arrival at the port of entry into the continental United States, as specified by the operational workplan.

(b) *Places of production requirements.* (1) Registered places of production of tree tomatoes destined for export to the continental United States must be determined by APHIS and the NPPO of Ecuador to be free from *A. fraterculus* and *C. capitata* based on trapping conducted in accordance with the operational workplan. If the flies per trap per day exceed levels specified in the operational workplan, the place of production will be prohibited from exporting tree tomatoes to the continental United States until APHIS and the NPPO of Ecuador jointly agree that the risk has been mitigated. The NPPO must keep records regarding the placement and monitoring of all traps, as well as records of all pest detections in these traps, for at least 1 year and provide the records to APHIS, upon request.

(2) Places of production must remove fallen tree tomato fruit in accordance with the operational workplan. Fallen fruit may not be included in field containers of fruit brought to the packinghouse to be packed for export.

(3) The NPPO of Ecuador must inspect fields at registered places of production at least once during the growing season for Tamarillo mosaic virus. Sites must be determined by the NPPO to be free of the virus as a result of these inspections.

(4) Starting 60 days before harvest and continuing throughout the shipping season, the NPPO of Ecuador must visit and inspect registered places of production monthly for signs of infestation. The NPPO of Ecuador must allow APHIS to monitor these inspections. The NPPO of Ecuador must also certify to APHIS that registered places of production have effective fruit fly trapping programs and control guidelines in place to reduce pest populations.

(5) If APHIS or the NPPO of Ecuador determines that a registered place of production has failed to follow the requirements in this paragraph (b), the place of production will be excluded from the export program until APHIS and the NPPO of Ecuador jointly agree that the place of production has taken appropriate remedial measures to address the plant pest risk.

(c) *Packinghouse requirements.* (1) During the time registered packinghouses are in use for packing tree tomatoes for export to the continental United States, the packinghouse can only accept tree tomatoes that are from registered places of production and that are produced in accordance with this section.

(2) Tree tomatoes must be packed in insect-proof cartons or containers, or covered with insect-proof mesh or plastic tarpaulin, within 24 hours of harvest. These safeguards must remain intact until the tree tomatoes arrive in the United States, or the consignment will not be allowed to enter the United States.

(3) All openings to the outside of the packinghouse must be covered by screening with openings of not more than 1.6 mm or by some other barrier that prevents pests from entering. The packinghouse must have double doors at the entrance to the facility and at the interior entrance to the area where the tree tomatoes are packed.

(d) *Phytosanitary inspections.* A biometric sample of tree tomato fruit jointly agreed upon by the NPPO of Ecuador and APHIS must be inspected in Ecuador by the NPPO of Ecuador or officials authorized by the NPPO of Ecuador following post-harvest processing. The sample must be visually inspected for *N. elegantalis* and Tamarillo mosaic virus. A portion of the fruit must then be cut open and inspected for *A. fraterculus* and *C. capitata.*

(1) If *N. elegantalis* is found, the entire lot of fruit will be prohibited from import into the United States unless it is treated with an approved quarantine treatment monitored by APHIS.

(2) If Tamarillo mosaic virus is found, the entire lot of fruit will be prohibited from importation into the United States.

(3) If a single larva of *A. fraterculus* and *C. capitata* is found, the entire lot of fruit will be prohibited from importation to the United States and the place of production producing that fruit will be suspended from the export program until appropriate measures, as agreed upon by the NPPO of Ecuador and APHIS, have been taken.

(e) *Phytosanitary certificate.* Each consignment of fresh tree tomato fruit from Ecuador must be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate, issued by the NPPO of Ecuador, that contains an additional declaration that the tomatoes were produced in accordance with the requirements of this section, and have been inspected and found free of *A. fraterculus,**C. capitata, N. elegantalis,* and the Tamarillo mosaic virus.
