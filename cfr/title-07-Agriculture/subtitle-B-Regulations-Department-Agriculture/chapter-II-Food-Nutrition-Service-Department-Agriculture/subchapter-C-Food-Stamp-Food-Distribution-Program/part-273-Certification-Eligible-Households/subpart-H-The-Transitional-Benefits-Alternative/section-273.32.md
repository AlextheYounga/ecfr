Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 2044, Jan. 6, 2017.

If a household receiving transitional benefits returns to TANF during the transitional period, the State agency shall end the household's transitional benefits and follow the procedures in § 273.31 to determine the household's continued eligibility and benefits for the Food Stamp Program. This includes processing the application within 30 days. However, for a household assigned a new certification period in accordance with § 273.27(c), the household must be recertified if it returns to TANF during its transitional period.
