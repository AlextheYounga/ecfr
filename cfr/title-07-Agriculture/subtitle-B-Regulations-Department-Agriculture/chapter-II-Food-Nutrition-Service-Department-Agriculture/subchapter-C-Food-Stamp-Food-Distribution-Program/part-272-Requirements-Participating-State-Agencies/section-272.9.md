##### § 272.9 Approval of homeless meal providers. #####

The State food stamp agency, or another appropriate State or local governmental agency identified by the State food stamp agency, shall approve establishments serving the homeless upon sufficient evidence, as determined by the agency, that the establishment does in fact serve meals to homeless persons. Where the State food stamp agency identifies another appropriate State or local agency for the purpose of approving establishments serving the homeless, the State food stamp agency will remain responsible for insuring that the provisions of the preceding sentence are effectively carried out. The State food stamp agency, or another appropriate State or local governmental agency identified by the State food stamp agency or private nonprofit organization under contract with the State food stamp agency shall execute contracts with restaurants wishing to sell meals in exchange for food stamp benefits to homeless food stamp households. Such contracts shall specify that such meals are to be sold at “concessional” (low or reduced) prices and shall also specify the approximate prices which will be charged, or the amount and type of price reduction.
