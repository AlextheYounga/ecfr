Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 57850, Aug. 23, 2023.

(a) *Grant closeout procedures.* Grant closeout procedures for the Program shall be in accordance with 2 CFR part 200, subpart D and USDA implementing regulations 2 CFR part 400 and part 415, as applicable.

(b) *Termination for cause.* (1) FNS may terminate a State agency's participation in the Program in whole, or in part, whenever it is determined that the State agency has failed to comply with the conditions of the Program. FNS shall promptly notify the State agency in writing of the termination and reason for the termination, together with the effective date, and shall allow the State 30 calendar days to respond. In instances where the State does respond, FNS shall inform the State of its final determination no later than 30 calendar days after the State responds.

(2) A State agency shall terminate a sponsor's participation in the Program by written notice whenever it is determined by the State agency that the sponsor has failed to comply with the conditions of the Program.

(3) When participation in the Program has been terminated for cause, any funds paid to the State agency or a sponsor or any recoveries by FNS from the State agency or by the State agency from a sponsor shall be in accordance with the legal rights and liabilities of the parties.

(c) *Termination for convenience.* FNS and the State agency may agree to terminate the State agency's participation in the Program in whole, or in part, when both parties agree that the continuation of the Program would not produce beneficial results commensurate with the further expenditure of funds. The two parties shall agree upon the termination conditions, including the effective date, and in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. The State agency shall not incur new obligations for the terminated portion after the effective date, and shall cancel as many outstanding obligations as possible. The Department shall allow full credit to the State agency for the Federal share of the noncancellable obligation properly incurred by the State agency prior to termination. A State agency may terminate a sponsor's participation in the manner provided for in this paragraph.

(d) *Maintenance of effort.* Expenditure of funds from State and local sources for the maintenance of food programs for children shall not be diminished as a result of funds received under the Act and a certification to this effect shall become part of the agreement provided for in § 225.3(c).

(e) *Program benefits.* The value of benefits and assistance available under the Program shall not be considered as income or resources of recipients and their families for any purpose under Federal, State or local laws, including, but not limited to, laws relating to taxation, welfare, and public assistance programs.

(f) *State requirements.* Nothing contained in this part shall prevent a State agency from imposing additional operating requirements which are not inconsistent with the provisions of this part, provided that such additional requirements shall not deny the Program to an area in which poor economic conditions exist, and shall not result in a significant number of needy children not having access to the Program. Prior to imposing any additional requirements, the State agency must receive approval from FNSRO.

(g) *Fraud penalty.* Whoever embezzles, willfully misapplies, steals, or obtains by fraud any funds, assets, or property that are the subject of a grant or other form of assistance under this part, whether received directly or indirectly from the Department, or whoever receives, conceals, or retains such funds, assets, or property to his use or gain, knowing such funds, assets, or property have been embezzled, willfully misapplied, stolen or obtained by fraud shall, if such funds, assets, or property are of the value of $100 or more, be fined not more than $25,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both, or if such funds, assets, or property are of a value of less than $100, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.

(h) *Claims adjustment authority.* The Secretary shall have the authority to determine the amount of, to settle, and to adjust any claim arising under the Program, and to compromise or deny such claim or any part thereof. The Secretary shall also have the authority to waive such claims if the Secretary determines that to do so would serve the purposes of the Program. This provision shall not diminish the authority of the Attorney General of the United States under section 516 of title 28, U.S. Code, to conduct litigation on behalf of the United States.

(i) *Data collection related to sponsors.* (1) Each State agency must collect data related to sponsors that have an agreement with the State agency to participate in the program for each of Federal fiscal years 2006 through 2009, including those sponsors that participated only for part of the fiscal year. Such data shall include:

(i) The name of each sponsor;

(ii) The city in which each participating sponsor was headquartered and the name of the state;

(iii) The amount of funds provided to the participating organization, i.e., the sum of the amount of federal funds reimbursed for operating and administrative cost; and

(iv) The type of participating organization, e.g., government agency, educational institution, non-profit organization/secular, non-profit organization/faith-based, and “other.”

(2) On or before August 31, 2007, and each subsequent year through 2010, State agencies must report to FNS data as specified in paragraph (i)(1) of this section for the prior Federal fiscal year. State agencies must submit this data in a format designated by FNS.

(j) *Program evaluations.* States, State agencies, sponsors, sites and contractors must cooperate in studies and evaluations conducted by or on behalf of the Department, related to programs authorized under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, as amended.
