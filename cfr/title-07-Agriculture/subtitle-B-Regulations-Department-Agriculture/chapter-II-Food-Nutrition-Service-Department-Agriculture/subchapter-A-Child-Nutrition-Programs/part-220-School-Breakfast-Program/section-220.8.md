##### § 220.8 Meal requirements for breakfasts. #####

(a) *General requirements.* This section contains the meal requirements applicable to school breakfasts for students in grades K through 12, and for children under the age of 5. With the exception of the milk component, the meal requirements must be implemented beginning July 1, 2013 or as otherwise specified. School food authorities wishing to adopt the provisions of this section prior to the required date of compliance may do so with the approval of the State agency. In general, school food authorities must ensure that participating schools provide nutritious, well-balanced, and age-appropriate breakfasts to all the children they serve to improve their diet and safeguard their health.

(1) *General nutrition requirements.* School breakfasts offered to children age 5 and older must meet, at a minimum, the meal requirements in paragraph (b) of this section. Schools must follow a food-based menu planning approach and produce enough food to offer each child the quantities specified in the meal pattern established in paragraph (c) of this section for each age/grade group served in the school. In addition, school breakfasts must meet the dietary specifications in paragraph (f) of this section. Schools offering breakfasts to children ages 1 to 4 and infants must meet the meal pattern requirements in paragraphs (o) and (p), as applicable, of this section. When breakfast is served in the cafeteria, schools must make potable water available and accessible without restriction to children at no charge.

(2) *Unit pricing.* Schools must price each meal as a unit. The price of a reimbursable lunch does not change if the student does not take a food item or requests smaller portions. Schools must identify, near or at the beginning of the serving line(s), the food items that constitute the unit-priced reimbursable school meal(s).

(3) *Production and menu records.* Schools or school food authorities, as applicable, must keep production and menu records for the meals they produce. These records must show how the meals offered contribute to the required food components and food quantities for each age/grade group every day. Labels or manufacturer specifications for food products and ingredients used to prepare school meals for students in grades K through 12 must indicate zero grams of *trans* fat per serving (less than 0.5 grams). Schools or school food authorities must maintain records of the latest nutritional analysis of the school menus conducted by the State agency. Production and menu records must be maintained in accordance with FNS guidance.

(b) *Meal requirements for school breakfasts.* School breakfasts for children ages 5 and older must reflect food and nutrition requirements specified by the Secretary. Compliance with these requirements, once fully implemented as specified in paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f), (h), (i), and (j) of this section, is measured as follows:

(1) On a daily basis:

(i) Meals offered to each age/grade group must include the food components and food quantities specified in the meal pattern in paragraph (c) of this section;

(ii) Food products or ingredients used to prepare meals must contain zero grams of *trans* fat per serving or a minimal amount of naturally occurring *trans* fat as specified in paragraph (f) of this section; and

(iii) Meal selected by each student must have the number of food components required for a reimbursable meal and include at least one fruit or vegetable.

(2) Over a 5-day school week:

(i) Average calorie content of the meals offered to each age/grade group must be within the minimum and maximum calorie levels specified in paragraph (f) of this section;

(ii) Average saturated fat content of the meals offered to each age/grade group must be less than 10 percent of total calories as specified in paragraph (f) of this section;

(iii) Average sodium content of the meals offered to each age/grade group must not exceed the maximum level specified in paragraph (f) of this section;

(c) *Meal pattern for school breakfasts for grades K through 12.* A school must offer the food components and quantities required in the breakfast meal pattern established in the following table:

<sup>a</sup> Food items included in each group and subgroup and amount equivalents. Minimum creditable serving is1/8 cup.

<sup>b</sup> One quarter cup of dried fruit counts as1/2 cup of fruit; 1 cup of leafy greens counts as1/2 cup of vegetables. No more than half of the fruit or vegetable offerings may be in the form of juice. All juice must be 100% full-strength.

<sup>c</sup> Beginning July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015) schools must offer 1 cup of fruit daily and 5 cups of fruit weekly. Vegetables may be substituted for fruits, but the first two cups per week of any such substitution must be from the dark green, red/orange, beans and peas (legumes) or “Other vegetables” subgroups, as defined in 210.10(c)(2)(iii).

<sup>d</sup> Beginning July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), at least half of grains offered must be whole-grain-rich and schools must meet the grain ranges. Schools may substitute 1 oz. eq. of meat/meat alternate for 1 oz. eq. of grains after the minimum daily grains requirement is met. By July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-15) all grains must be whole-grain-rich.

<sup>e</sup> There is no meat/meat alternate requirement.

<sup>f</sup> Beginning July 1, 2012 (SY 2012-2013) all fluid milk must be low-fat (1 percent milk fat or less, unflavored) or fat-free (unflavored or flavored).

<sup>g</sup> Beginning July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), the average daily calories for a 5-day school week must be within the range (at least the minimum and no more than the maximum values).

<sup>h</sup> Discretionary sources of calories (solid fats and added sugars) may be added to the meal pattern if within the specifications for calories, saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium. Foods of minimal nutritional value and fluid milk with fat content greater than 1 percent milk fat are not allowed.

<sup>i</sup> Final sodium targets must be met no later than July 1, 2022 (SY 2022-2023). The first intermediate targets must be met no later than July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015) and the second intermediate targets must be met no later than July 1, 2017 (SY 2017-2018).

<sup>j</sup>Trans fat restrictions must be implemented on July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-14).

(1) *Age/grade groups.* Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), schools must plan menus for students using the following age/grade groups: Grades K-5 (ages 5-10), grades 6-8 (ages 11-13), and grades 9-12 (ages 14-18). If an unusual grade configuration in a school prevents the use of the established age/grade groups, students in grades K-5 and grades 6-8 may be offered the same food quantities at breakfast provided that the calorie and sodium standards for each age/grade group are met. No customization of the established age/grade groups is allowed.

(2) *Food components.* Schools must offer students in each age/grade group the food components specified in meal pattern in paragraph (c). Food component descriptions in § 210.10 of this chapter apply to this Program.

(i) *Meats/meat alternates component.* Schools are not required to offer meats/meat alternates as part of the breakfast menu. Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), schools may substitute meats/meat alternates for grains, after the daily grains requirement is met, to meet the weekly grains requirement. One ounce equivalent of meat/meat alternate is equivalent to one ounce equivalent of grains.

(A) *Enriched macaroni.* Enriched macaroni with fortified protein as defined in appendix A to part 210 may be used to meet part of the meats/meat alternates requirement when used as specified in appendix A to part 210. An enriched macaroni product with fortified protein as defined in appendix A to part 210 may be used to meet part of the meats/meat alternates component or the grains component but may not meet both food components in the same lunch.

(B) *Nuts and seeds.* Nuts and seeds and their butters are allowed as meat alternates in accordance with program guidance. Acorns, chestnuts, and coconuts may not be used because of their low protein and iron content. Nut and seed meals or flours may be used only if they meet the requirements for Alternate Protein Products established in appendix A to part 220. Nuts or seeds may be used to meet no more than one-half (50 percent) of the meats/meat alternates component with another meats/meat alternates to meet the full requirement.

(C) *Yogurt.* Yogurt may be used to meet all or part of the meats/meat alternates component. Yogurt may be plain or flavored, unsweetened or sweetened. Noncommercial and/or non-standardized yogurt products, such as frozen yogurt, drinkable yogurt products, homemade yogurt, yogurt flavored products, yogurt bars, yogurt covered fruits and/or nuts or similar products are not creditable. Four ounces (weight) or1/2 cup (volume) of yogurt equals one ounce of the meats/meat alternates requirement.

(D) *Tofu and soy products.* Commercial tofu and soy products may be used to meet all or part of the meats/meat alternates component in accordance with FNS guidance. Noncommercial and/or non-standardized tofu and products are not creditable.

(E) *Beans and peas (legumes).* Cooked dry beans and peas (legumes) may be used to meet all or part of the meats/meat alternates component. Beans and peas (legumes) are identified in this section and include foods such as black beans, garbanzo beans, lentils, kidney beans, mature lima beans, navy beans, pinto beans, and split peas.

(F) *Other meat alternates.* Other meat alternates, such as cheese and eggs, may be used to meet all or part of the meats/meat alternates component in accordance with FNS guidance.

(ii) *Fruits component.* Effective July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015), schools must offer daily the fruit quantities specified in the breakfast meal pattern in paragraph (c) of this section. Fruits that are fresh; frozen without added sugar; canned in light syrup, water or fruit juice; or dried may be offered to meet the fruits component requirements. Vegetables may be offered in place of all or part of the required fruits at breakfast, but the first two cups per week of any such substitution must be from the dark green, red/orange, beans and peas (legumes) or other vegetable subgroups, as defined in this section. All fruits are credited based on their volume as served, except that1/4 cup of dried fruit counts as1/2 cup of fruit. Only pasteurized, full-strength fruit juice may be used, and may be credited to meet no more than one-half of the fruit component.

(iii) *Vegetables component.* Schools are not required to offer vegetables as part of the breakfast menu but may, effective July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015), offer vegetables to meet part or all of the fruit requirement. Fresh, frozen, or canned vegetables and dry beans and peas (legumes) may be offered to meet the fruit requirement. All vegetables are credited based on their volume as served, except that 1 cup of leafy greens counts as1/2 cup of vegetables and tomato paste and tomato puree are credited based on calculated volume of the whole food equivalency. Pasteurized, full-strength vegetable juice may be used to meet no more than one-half of the vegetable component. Cooked dry beans or peas (legumes) may be counted as either a vegetable or as a meat alternate but not as both in the same meal.

(iv) *Grains component.* (A) *Enriched and whole grains.* All grains must be made with enriched and whole grain meal or flour, in accordance with the most recent FNS guidance on grains. Whole grain-rich products must contain at least 50 percent whole grains and the remaining grains in the product must be enriched. Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), schools may substitute meats/meat alternates for grains, after the daily grains requirement is met, to meet the weekly grains requirement. One ounce equivalent of meat/meat alternate is equivalent to one ounce equivalent of grains.

(B) *Daily and weekly servings.* Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), the grains component is based on minimum daily servings plus total servings over a five-day school week. Beginning July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), half of the grains offered during the school week must meet the whole grain-rich criteria specified in FNS guidance. Beginning July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015), all grains must meet the whole grain-rich criteria specified in FNS guidance. The whole grain-rich criteria provided in FNS guidance may be updated to reflect additional information provided voluntarily by industry on the food label or a whole grains definition by the Food and Drug Administration. Schools serving breakfast 6 or 7 days per week must increase the weekly grains quantity by approximately 20 percent (1/5) for each additional day. When schools operate less than 5 days per week, they may decrease the weekly quantity by approximately 20 percent (1/5) for each day less than five. The servings for biscuits, rolls, muffins, and other grain/bread varieties are specified in FNS guidance.

(3) *Food components in outlying areas.* Schools in American Samoa, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands may serve a vegetable such as yams, plantains, or sweet potatoes to meet the grains component.

(d) *Fluid milk requirement.* A serving of fluid milk as a beverage or on cereal or used in part for each purpose must be offered for breakfasts. Schools must offer students a variety (at least two different options) of fluid milk. Effective July 1, 2012 (SY 2012-2013), all milk must be fat-free or low-fat. Milk with higher fat content is not allowed. Fat-free fluid milk may be flavored or unflavored, and low-fat fluid milk must be unflavored. Low fat or fat-free lactose-free and reduced-lactose fluid milk may also be offered. Schools must also comply with other applicable fluid milk requirements in § 210.10(d)(1) through (4) of this chapter.

(e) *Offer versus serve for grades K through 12.* School breakfast must offer daily at least the three food components required in the meal pattern in paragraph (c) of this section. To exercise the offer versus serve option at breakfast, a school food authority or school must offer a minimum of four food items daily as part of the required components. Under offer versus serve, students are allowed to decline one of the four food items, provided that students select at least1/2 cup of the fruit component for a reimbursable meal beginning July 1, 2014 (SY 2014-2015). If only three food items are offered at breakfast, school food authorities or schools may not exercise the offer versus serve option.

(f) *Dietary specifications.* (1) *Calories.* Effective July 1, 2013 (SY 2013-2014), school breakfasts offered to each age/grade group must meet, on average over the school week, the minimum and maximum calorie levels specified in the following table:

Calorie Ranges for Breakfast - Effective SY 2013-2014
