##### ยง 3555.306 Liquidation. #####

(a) *General.* (1) When a lender determines that a borrower is unable or unwilling to meet loan obligations with servicing options under this subpart, the lender must accelerate the guaranteed loan and, if necessary, foreclose.

(2) Prior to acceleration the lender must have advised the borrower, in writing, of available foreclosure avoidance options and the borrower must have failed to request such options.

(3) The lender must accelerate the guaranteed loan, with a demand letter, when the account is three scheduled payments past due unless there is a reasonable prospect of resolving the delinquency through another method.

(4) The borrower is responsible for all expenses associated with liquidation and acquisition.

(b) *Foreclosure.* (1) The lender must initiate foreclosure within 90 calendar days of the decision to liquidate unless Federal, State, or local law requires that foreclosure action be delayed. When there is a legal delay (such as bankruptcy), foreclosure must be initiated within 90 calendar days after it becomes possible to do so. Foreclosure initiation begins with the first public action required by law such as filing a complaint or petition, recording a notice of default, or publication of a notice of sale.

(2) Lenders must exercise due diligence in completing the liquidation process to ensure the foreclosure is cost effective, expeditious, and completed in an efficient manner, as otherwise provided by the Agency. The lender must choose the foreclosure method representing the best interest of the Federal Government.

(3) The lender's decision to bid at foreclosure and any bid amount will be based upon the property value, whether the property value is sufficient to cover the existing debt and incurred costs, and any potential to recover a deficiency. The lender will encourage third party bidding at a foreclosure sale when the total debt, including the cost of acquiring, managing and disposing of the property, if acquired, is greater than the gross proceeds expected from a foreclosure sale at market value.

(c) Unless State law imposes other requirements, the lender may reinstate an accelerated account if the borrower pays, or makes acceptable arrangements to pay, all past-due amounts, any protective advances, and any foreclosure-related costs incurred by the lender.

(d) *Bankruptcy.* (1) When a borrower files a petition in bankruptcy, the lender must suspend collection and foreclosure actions in accordance with Title 11 of the United States Code.

(2) The lender may accept conveyance of security property by the trustee in the bankruptcy, or the borrower, if the bankruptcy court has approved the transaction, and the lender will acquire title free of all liens and encumbrances except the lender's liens.

(3) Whenever possible after the borrower has filed for protection under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code, a reaffirmation agreement will be signed by the borrower and approved by the bankruptcy court prior to discharge, if the lender and the borrower decide to continue with the loan.

(4) The lender must protect the guaranteed loan debt and all collateral securing the loan in bankruptcy proceedings.

(5) The lender can include principal and interest lost as a result of bankruptcy proceedings in any claim filed in accordance with ยง 3555.354.

(e) *Maintain condition of security property.* The lender must make reasonable and prudent efforts to ensure that the condition of the security property is maintained during any liquidation, acquisition, and sale of the property. These efforts include, but are not limited to, periodic inspections, performing necessary repairs, winterization, securing the property, removing debris, yard maintenance and ensuring the continuance of property insurance. The lender must identify, determine the cause, and document any environmental hazard affecting the value of the security property. The lender must retain a record of all efforts to maintain the condition of the security property.

(f) *Managing and disposing of REO property.* Lenders will expeditiously gain possession of the REO property in a manner designed to ensure maximum recovery as follows.

(1) The lender must prepare and maintain a disposition plan on all acquired properties. The lender will submit the property disposition plan and any subsequent changes for Agency concurrence in a timely manner as specified by the Agency. The lender may obtain a waiver of the concurrence requirement as provided for in ยง 3555.301(h). The plan will include the proposed method for sale of the property, the estimated value based on an appraisal, minimum sale price, itemized estimated costs of the sale, and any other information that could impact the amount of loss on the loan.

(2) The lender will make all reasonable efforts to sell the property within 9 months from the later of either the foreclosure sale or expiration of any redemption period. The Agency may grant an extension of the permissible marketing period in limited circumstances including, but not limited to, when a separate legal action is necessary to gain possession of the property following foreclosure or when the lender has or is in final negotiation for a firm purchase agreement. If the property is on American Indian restricted land, an additional 3 month marketing period is permitted.

(3) The lender must notify the Agency when the property has not been sold within 30 days of the expiration of the permissible marketing period. If the REO remains unsold at the end of the permissible marketing period, the lender will order a liquidation value appraisal and the Agency will apply an acquisition and management resale factor to estimate holding and disposition cost. Interest expenses accrued beyond 90 days of the foreclosure sale date or expiration of any redemption period, whichever is later, will be the responsibility of the lender and not covered by the guarantee.

(g) *Debt settlement reporting.* The lender must report to the IRS and all national credit reporting repositories any debt settled through liquidation.
