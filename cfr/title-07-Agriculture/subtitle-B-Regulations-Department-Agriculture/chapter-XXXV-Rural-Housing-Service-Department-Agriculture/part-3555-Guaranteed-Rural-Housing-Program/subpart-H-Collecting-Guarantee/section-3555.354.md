##### ยง 3555.354 Loss claim procedures. #####

Rural Development may offer authorized lenders a web-based automated system to calculate, submit or update a loss claim request and/or future recovery subject to the requirements of ยง 3555.356. Manual paper loss claims may continue to be submitted by some lenders. Lenders must make a thorough review of all receipts and expenses prior to submitting a loss claim request. Supplemental adjustments to the initial claim may be considered, as provided by the Agency.

(a) *Sold property.* For property that has been sold, the lender must submit a loss claim within 45 calendar days of the sale. Late claims made beyond this period of time may be rejected or reduced by Rural Development. Instructions and forms may be obtained from Rural Development.

(b) *REO.* If the property has not been sold, the lender must take the following steps:

(1) The lender must submit a loss claim request that includes a completed liquidation value appraisal within 30 calendar days of the period ending:

(i) Nine (9) months after either foreclosure or the end of any applicable redemption period, whichever is later, if the property remains unsold and is not located on American Indian restricted land; or

(ii) Twelve (12) months after either foreclosure or the end of any applicable redemption period, whichever is later, if the property remains unsold and is located on American Indian restricted land. Late claims made beyond this period of time, or submitted with a liquidation value appraisal not completed within the timeframes described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, may be rejected.

(2) The lender must submit a loss claim that includes the completed liquidation value appraisal within 30 calendar days of receiving the appraisal. Late claims made beyond this period of time, or submitted with a liquidation value appraisal not completed within the timeframes described in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section, may be rejected.

(c) *Deficiency judgments.* The lender must enforce any judgment for which there are current prospects of collection before submitting a loss claim, and amounts collected must be applied against the outstanding debt. Rural Development will process the loss claim if there are no current prospects for collection.
