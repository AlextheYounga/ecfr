Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 70887, Dec. 26, 2019.

The lender must notify the Agency upon sale of an REO property. If the lender recovers additional funds after the loss claim has been paid, the proceeds will be distributed so that the total loss to the Government is equivalent to the loss that would have been incurred had the recovered amount been included in the initial loss calculation.
