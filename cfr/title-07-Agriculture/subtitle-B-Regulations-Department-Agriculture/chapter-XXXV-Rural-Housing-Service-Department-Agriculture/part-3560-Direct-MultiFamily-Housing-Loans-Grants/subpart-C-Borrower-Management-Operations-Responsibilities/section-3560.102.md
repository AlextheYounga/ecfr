##### § 3560.102 Housing project management. #####

(a) *General.* Borrowers hold final responsibility for housing project management and must ensure that operations comply with the terms of all loan or grant documents, Agency requirements and applicable local, state and Federal laws and ordinances. Project operations shall be conducted to meet the actual needs and necessary expenses of the property or for any other purpose authorized under Agency regulations. Any party not meeting these responsibilities may be subject to penalties. It is expected that only typical and reasonable expenses be incurred for the services rendered. Consequently, methods to inflate, duplicate, obscure, or failure to disclose the true nature and cost of work performed for the services rendered will cause the Agency to deny budget requests for the services or issue a demand for recovery and reimbursement for unauthorized actions.

(b) *Management plan.* Borrowers must develop and maintain a management plan for each housing project covered by their loan or grant. The management plan must establish the systems and procedures necessary to ensure that housing project operations comply with Agency requirements.

(1) At a minimum, management plans must address the following items:

(i) Maintenance systems, including procedures for routine maintenance, capital item repair and replacement, and effective energy conservation practices;

(ii) Personnel policies, job descriptions, staffing plans, training procedures for on-site staff. The Borrower will include specific duties and responsibilities of each property manager, site manager and caretaker;

(iii) Front-line management functions to be performed by off-site staff;

(iv) Plans and procedures for providing supplemental services including laundry, vending, and security;

(v) Plans for accounting, record keeping and meeting Agency reporting requirements;

(vi) Procurement procedures;

(vii) Rent and occupancy charge collection procedures, and procedures for requesting and implementing changes in rents, utility allowances, or occupancy charges;

(viii) Plans and procedures for marketing rental units and maintaining compliance with the Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan in accordance with § 3560.104;

(ix) Unit leases and leasing policies and procedures, including procedures for maintaining and purging waiting lists, determining applicant eligibility, certifying and recertifying income, tenant selection, and occupancy policies such as security deposit amounts, occupancy rules, termination of leases or occupancy agreements and eviction;

(x) Plans for allowing tenant participation in property operations and for fostering tenant relationships with management;

(xi) Procedures for applicant and tenant appeals; and

(xii) Describe how management will make known to tenants and applicants that management will provide reasonable accommodations under the Fair Housing Act, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and regulations implemented thereunder at the borrower's expense unless to do so would cause an undue financial or administrative burden, how such requests are to be made, and who within management will have the authority to approve or disapprove a request for an accommodation.

(2) Loan or grant applicants must submit a management plan before the Agency will give final approval to the loan or grant application. The plan must address the required items identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in sufficient detail to enable the Agency to monitor housing project performance.

(c) *Management plan effective period.* A management plan remains in effect as long as it accurately reflects housing project operations and the housing project is in compliance with the Agency requirements.

(1) Borrowers must submit an updated management plan to the Agency if operations change or are no longer consistent with the management plan on file with the Agency.

(2) When there are no changes in operations, borrowers must submit a certification to the Agency every 3 years stating that operations are consistent with the management plan and the plan is adequate to assure compliance with the loan and grant documents and Agency requirements or applicable local, state and Federal laws.

(3) If the Agency determines that operations are in compliance with Agency requirements, loan or grant agreements, or applicable local, state, and Federal laws, but are not consistent with the management plan, the Agency will require the borrower to:

(i) Revise the management plan to accurately reflect housing operations;

(ii) Take actions to ensure the management plan is followed; or

(iii) Advise the Agency in writing of the action taken.

(4) When a housing project is being transferred from one borrower to another, the transferee must submit a management plan that addresses the required items identified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in sufficient detail to enable the Agency to give final approval of the transfer.

(d) *Housing projects with compliance violations.* Upon receiving notice of compliance violations in accordance with § 3560.354, borrowers must submit to the Agency:

(1) Revisions to the management plan establishing the changes in housing operations that will be made to restore compliance;

(2) If the borrower determines the compliance violations were due to a failure to follow the management plan, the borrower must certify to the Agency that the management plan is adequate to assure compliance with the applicable requirements of this part and submit a written description of the actions they will take to ensure the management plan is followed; or

(3) If the Agency discovers continued discrepancies between a management plan and housing project operations or compliance violations, the Agency may require the borrower to install a different management agent acceptable to the Agency as described in paragraph (e) of this section.

(e) *Acceptable management agents.* Borrowers must obtain Agency approval of the agent proposed to manage a housing project prior to entering into any formal agreement with the agent and prior to allowing the agent to assume responsibility for housing project operations. Borrowers that plan to self-manage a housing project also must receive Agency approval before assuming responsibility for housing operations.

(1) Borrowers must submit a written request for Agency approval of the proposed management agent at least 45 days prior to the date the agent is to assume responsibility for operations. This request must include a profile of the proposed management agent that provides sufficient information to allow the Agency to evaluate whether the agent is acceptable.

(2) The Agency will deny approval of any proposed management agent that cannot provide evidence of at least two years of experience and satisfactory performance in directing and overseeing the management of similar federally-assisted MFH.

(3) The Agency may issue approval of a management agent that does not meet the requirements of § 3560.102(e)(2) if the management agent can provide evidence that indicates the ability to successfully manage a MFH project in accordance with Agency requirements.

(4) If a borrower enters into an agreement with a management agent or begins to self-manage prior to receiving Agency approval, the Agency will place the borrower in non-monetary default status and will require the borrower to immediately terminate the contract with the management agent.

(f) *Self-management.* Borrowers may self-manage a housing project but must receive Agency approval before assuming responsibility for housing operations. Borrowers that plan to self-manage must meet all requirements of § 3560.102, except for paragraph (h) of this section.

(g) *Identity-of-interest disclosure.* Borrowers and management agents must disclose to the Agency all identity-of-interest relationships which they have with firms and must receive Agency approval to use such firms prior to entering into any contractual relationships with such entities that involve Agency funds.

(1) This disclosure must include any identity-of-interest relationships between:

(i) The borrower and the management agent;

(ii) The borrower or management agent and the providers of supplies and services to the housing project; and

(iii) The borrower or the management agent and employees of any of the above.

(2) Failure to disclose such relationships may subject the borrower, the management agent, and the other firms or employees found to have an identity of interest relationship to suspension, debarment, or other remedies available to the Agency.

(3) After disclosure of an identity-of-interest relationship:

(i) The borrower, management agent, and supplier of goods and services must provide documentation proving that use of identity-of-interest firms is in the best interest of the housing project;

(ii) Any supplier of goods and services must certify in writing to the Agency that the individual or organization has a viable, on-going trade or business qualified and licensed, if appropriate, to do the work for which a contract is being proposed;

(iii) The borrower, management agent, and supplier of goods and services must agree, in writing, that all records related to the housing project will be made available to the Agency, Office of the Inspector General (OIG), General Accountability Office (GAO), or a representative of the Agency, upon request; and

(iv) The Agency will deny the use of an identity-of-interest firm when the Agency determines such use is not in the best interest of the Federal Government or the tenants.

(h) *Management agreement.* Borrowers contracting with a management agent must execute a management agreement that establishes:

(1) The management agent's responsibility to comply with Agency requirements and local, state, and Federal laws;

(2) That the management fee is payable out of the housing project's general operating account consistent with the requirements of paragraph (i) of this section; and

(3) The Agency's authority to terminate the agreement for failure to operate the housing project in accordance with Agency requirements or local, state, or Federal laws.

(i) *Management fees.* Management fees will be an allowable expense to be paid from the housing project's general operating account only if the fee is approved by the Agency as a reasonable cost to the housing project and documented on the management certification. Management fees must be developed in accordance with the following:

(1) The management fee may compensate the management entity only for the specifically identified bundle of services to be provided to the housing project. Costs and services to be paid as part of the bundle of services include:

(i) Supervision by the management agent and its staff (time, knowledge, and expertise) of overall operations and capital improvements of the site.

(ii) Hiring, supervision, and termination of on-site staff.

(iii) General maintenance of project books and records (general ledger, accounts payable and receivable, payroll, etc.). Preparation and distribution of payroll for all on-site employees, including the costs of preparing and submitting all appropriate tax reports and deposits, unemployment and workers' compensation reports, and other IRS- or state-required reports.

(i) Periodically, the Agency will develop a range of base per occupied unit fees that will be paid in each state. The Agency will develop the fees based on a review of housing industry data. The final base for occupied unit fees for each state will be made available to all borrowers.

(ii) Periodically, the Agency will develop the amount and qualifications to receive add-on fees. The final set of qualifications will be made available to all borrowers.

(3) Allowable Administrative Expenses. (i) *Identifying the Type of Administrative Expense.* Management Plans and Agreements must describe if administrative expenses are to be paid from the management fee or paid for as a project cost.

(A) A management plan is required for all projects. The management plan should describe administrative expenses paid from management agent fees or project operations. The management plan should provide job descriptions for the site manager, the management agent and other personnel. It is important that these documents accurately reflect the duties being performed by the various personnel. The management plan must meet the standards set out in this rule.

(B) A task list should be used to identify which services are included in the management fee, which services are included in project operations, and which are pro-rated along with the methodology used to pro-rating of expenses between management agent fees and project operations. Some property responsibilities are completed at the property and some offsite. Agent responsibilities may be performed at the property, the management office, or at some other location.

(C) Disputes may arise as to who performs certain services. The management plan and job descriptions should normally provide sufficient clarity to avoid or resolve any such disputes; however, sometimes clarifications and supporting materials may be required to resolve disputes. The decision must be made based on the most complete evaluation of the facts presented.

(ii) *Allowable Administrative Expenses.* Payroll related administrative expenses are allowable expenses. Postage expense to mail out rental applications, third-party (asset income and adjustments to income) verifications, application processing correspondence (acceptance or denial letters), mailing project invoice payments, required correspondence, and report submittals to various regulatory authorities for the managed property are allowable project expenses no matter what location or point of origin the mail is generated. Photocopying or printing expense related to actual production of project brochures, marketing pieces, forms, reports, notices, and newsletters are allowable project expenses no matter what location or point of origin the work is performed including outsourcing the work to a professional printer. Correspondence or reports required for record retention or project compliance are allowable project expenses. The cost or expense of equipment and any related equipment service contract is a management agent direct expense, unless the machine becomes the property of the project after purchase.

(iii) *Determining if Expenses are Reasonable.* Generally, expenses charged to project operations, whether for management agent services or other expenses, must be reasonable, typical, necessary and show a clear benefit to the residents of the property. Services and expenses charged to the property must show value added and be for authorized purposes. If such value is not apparent, the service or expense should be examined.

(A) Administrative expenses for project operations exceeding 23 percent, or those typical for the area, of gross potential basic rents and revenues (*i.e.*, referred to as gross potential rents in industry publications) highlight a need for closer review for unnecessary expenditures. Budget approval is required and project resources may not always permit an otherwise allowable expense to be incurred if it is not fiscally prudent in the market.

(B) Excessive administrative expenses can result in inadequate funds to meet other essential project needs, including expenditures for repair and maintenance needed to keep the project in sound physical condition. Actions that are improper or not fiscally prudent may warrant budget disapproval and/or a demand for recovery action.

(4) Unallowable Administrative Expenses.

(i) Certain expenses are not allowable such as legal fees, association dues, bonuses or monetary performance awards, parties, computer hardware and some software, and telephone purchases.

(ii) It is inappropriate to charge for legal services to represent any interest other than the borrower's interest (*i.e.*, representing a general partner or limited partner to defend their individual owner interest is not allowable). Where there is no finding of a borrower's fault, commercially reasonable legal expenses and costs for defending or settling lawsuits (without admission of liability) are allowable.

(iii) Charging for payment of penalties, including opposition legal fees resulting from an award finding improper actions on the part of the owner or management agent is generally an inappropriate project expense. The party responsible generally pays such expenses for violating the standards or by their insurance carriers.

(iv) Association dues to be paid by the project should only be related to training for site managers or management agents. To the extent that association dues can document training for site managers or management agents related to project activities by actual cost or pro-ration, a reasonable expense may be billed to the project.

(v) It is inappropriate for the project to pay for bonuses or monetary performance awards to site managers or management agents that are not clearly provided for by the site manager salary contract.

(vi) Billing the project for parties that are large or unreasonable, such as renting expensive party halls or hotel rooms and payment for alcoholic beverages or gifts to management agent staff are also inappropriate.

(vii) It is inappropriate to bill the project for computer hardware, some software, and internal connections that are beyond the scope and size reasonably needed for the services supplied (*i.e.*, purchasing equipment or software for use by a site manager that is clearly beyond that needed to support project operations). Note that computer learning center activities benefiting tenants are not covered in this prohibition.

(viii) It is inappropriate to bill the project for practices that are inefficient such as routine use of collect calls from a site manager to a management agent office.

(j) *Management certification.* (1) As a condition of approval of the management agent and the management fee, the borrower and the management agents must execute an Agency-approved certification establishing an allowable management fee to be paid out of the housing project's general operating account and certifying that:

(i) The borrower and management agent agree to operate the housing project in accordance with the management plan;

(ii) The borrower and the management agent will comply with Agency requirements, loan or grant agreements, applicable local, state and Federal laws and ordinances, and contract obligations, will certify that no payments have been made to anyone in return for awarding the management contract to the management agent, and will agree that such payments will not be made in the future;

(iii) The borrower and the management agent will comply with Agency notices or other policy directives that relate to the management of the housing project;

(iv) The management agreement between the borrower and management agent complies with the requirements of this section;

(v) The borrower and the management agent will comply with Agency requirements regarding management fees as specified in paragraph (i) of this section, and allocation of management costs between the management fee and the housing project financial accounts specified in § 3560.302(c)(3);

(vi) The borrower and the management agent will not purchase goods and services from entities that have an identity-of-interest (IOI) with the borrower or the management agent until the IOI relationship has been disclosed to the Agency according to paragraph (g) of this section, not denied by the Agency under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, and it has been determined that the costs are as low as or lower than arms-length, open-market purchases; and

(vii) The borrower and the management agent agree that all records related to the housing project are the property of the housing project and that the Agency, OIG, or GAO may inspect the housing records and the records of the borrower, management agent, and suppliers of goods and services having an IOI with the borrower or with a management agent acting as an agent of the borrower upon demand.

(2) A certification will be executed each time a management agent is proposed and a management agreement is executed or renewed. Any amendment to a management certification must be approved by the Agency and the borrower.

(k) *Procurement.* The borrower and the agents of the borrower must obtain contracts, materials, supplies, utilities, and services at a reasonable cost and seek the most advantageous terms to the housing project. Any discounts, rebates, fees, proceeds, or commissions obtainable with respect to purchases, service contracts, or other transactions must be credited to the housing project.

(l) *Electronic Submission of Data to Agency.* For properties with eight or more housing units, the Agency may specify that borrowers submit information required by this part electronically.
