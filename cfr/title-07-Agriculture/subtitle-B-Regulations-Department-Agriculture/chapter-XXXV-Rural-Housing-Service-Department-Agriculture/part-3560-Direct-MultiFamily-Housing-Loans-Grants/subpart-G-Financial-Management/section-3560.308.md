(a) *General.* Borrowers must submit annual financial reports that meet the requirements of this section. The annual financial reports to be submitted are the Multi-Family Housing (MFH) Project Budget with actual expenditures and the MFH Balance Sheet. Annual financial reports are due to the Agency within 90 days of the end of the borrower's fiscal year.

(1) Borrowers with 16 or more units in their housing project must base their annual financial reports on an engagement report completed according to agreed upon procedures established by the Agency as specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Borrowers must include the engagement report with their annual financial reports submitted to the Agency.

(2) Borrowers with less than 16 units in their housing project must submit annual financial reports using a limited scope engagement based on Agency approved procedures and certify that the housing meets the performance standards established in paragraph (c) of this section. Borrowers may use a CPA to prepare this report. For properties that prepare a limited scope engagement, the Agency may undertake random audits, once every two or three years.

(3) If a third party requires it, the borrower may have a CPA prepare an audit in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS). Costs incurred to obtain this audit are an allowable project expense.

(1) Borrowers must use an Agency approved engagement letter. Borrowers must submit the results of an engagement that examines specific records using agreed upon procedures established by the Agency and that describes the borrower's performance in meeting the standards described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(2) The engagement will be initiated by the borrower using the Agency's engagement letter, which will specify the engagement program and establish the reporting requirements for the engagement.

(3) The engagement must be conducted by a CPA in accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountant (AICPA) Standards and Agency requirements.

(4) All engagement reports must be prepared for use by the Agency.

(c) *Performance standards.* Borrowers must ensure that:

(1) Required accounts are properly maintained and tracked separately;

(2) Payments from operating accounts are disclosed and accurately represented on financial reports;

(3) The reserve amount is at the authorized level and there are no encumbrances;

(d) *Other financial reports.* (1) Nonprofit and public borrower entities must submit audits in accordance with 7 CFR part 3052 that must also include the requirements set forth in the limited scope engagement.

(2) The Agency may require additional opinions of financial condition and compliance, such as audits, to assure the security of the asset, determine whether the housing project is being operated at a reasonable cost, or to detect fraud, waste, or abuse.

(3) Any audits independently obtained by the borrower also must be submitted to the Agency.
