##### § 3550.57 Dwelling requirements. #####

(a) *Modest dwelling.* The property must be one that is considered modest for the area, must not be designed for income producing purposes, must not have an in-ground swimming pool or have a market value in excess of the applicable maximum loan limit, in accordance with § 3550.63, unless RHS authorizes an exception under this paragraph. An exception may be granted on a case-by-case basis to accommodate the specific needs of an applicant, such as to serve exceptionally large households or to provide reasonable accommodation for a household member with a disability. Any additional loan amount approved must not exceed the amount required to address the specific need.

(1) *Area-wide exception.* Area-wide exceptions may be granted when RHS determines that the section 203(b) limit is too low to enable applicants to purchase adequate housing.

(2) *Individual exceptions.* Individual exceptions may be granted to accommodate the specific needs of an applicant, such as to serve exceptionally large households or to provide reasonable accommodation for a household member with a disability. Any additional loan amount approved must not exceed the amount required to address the specific need.

(b) *New dwellings.* Construction must meet the requirements in 7 CFR part 1924, subpart A.

(c) *Existing dwellings.* Existing dwellings must be structurally sound; functionally adequate; in good repair, or to be placed in good repair with loan funds; have adequate electrical, heating, plumbing, water, and wastewater disposal systems; and be free of termites and other wood damaging pests and organisms.
