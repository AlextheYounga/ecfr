Any additional loan amount approved must not exceed the amount required to address the specific need.

(2) *Individual exceptions.* Individual exceptions may be granted to accommodate the specific needs of an applicant, such as to serve exceptionally large households or to provide reasonable accommodation for a household member with a disability. Any additional loan amount approved must not exceed the amount required to address the specific need.
