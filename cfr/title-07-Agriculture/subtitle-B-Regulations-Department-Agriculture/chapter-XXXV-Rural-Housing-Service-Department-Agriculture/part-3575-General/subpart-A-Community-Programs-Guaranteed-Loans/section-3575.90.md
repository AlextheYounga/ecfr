##### ยง 3575.90 Disposition of acquired property. #####

(a) *General.* When the lender acquires title to the collateral and the final loss claim is not paid until final disposition, the lender must proceed as quickly as possible to develop a plan to fully protect the collateral, and the lender must dispose of the collateral without delay.

(b) *Re-title collateral.* Any collateral accepted by the lender *must not* be titled in the Agency's name in whole or in part. The Agency's position is that of a guarantor relating to losses, not a lender.

(c) *Collateral preservation.* After acquiring the collateral, the lender must protect the collateral from deterioration (weather, vandalism, etc.). Hazard insurance in an amount necessary to cover the fair market value of the collateral must be maintained.

(d) *Collateral sale.* (1) The lender will prepare and submit to the Agency a plan on the best method of sale, keeping in mind any prospective purchasers. The Agency must approve the plan in writing. If an existing approved liquidation plan addresses the disposition of acquired property, no further review is required unless modification of the plan is needed.

(2) Anytime there is a case when the conversion of collateral to cash can reasonably be expected to result in a negative net recovery amount, abandonment of the collateral should be considered. The Agency must approve abandonment in writing.
