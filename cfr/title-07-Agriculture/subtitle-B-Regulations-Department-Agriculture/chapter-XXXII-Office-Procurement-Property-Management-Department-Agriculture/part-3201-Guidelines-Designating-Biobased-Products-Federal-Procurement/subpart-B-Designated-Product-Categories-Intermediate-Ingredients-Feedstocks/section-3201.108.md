##### § 3201.108 Intermediates—Plastic Resins. #####

(a) *Definition.* Intermediates—Plastic Resins are materials that are typically viscous liquids with the ability to harden permanently and may exist in liquid or solid (powder or pellets) states. Intermediates—Plastic Resins may be used in a variety of finished products neat, consisting of a single resin or polymer, or a homogeneous blend of two or more neat resins or polymers, or a composite, containing two or more distinct materials such as fiber-reinforced resins. Additionally, Intermediates—Plastic Resins may be used in finished products as additives such as plasticizers, pigments, thermal stability agents, or impact modifiers.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The Federal preferred procurement product must have a minimum biobased content of at least 22 percent, which shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product.

(c) *Preference compliance date.* No later than July 10, 2019, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased Intermediates—Plastic Resins. By that date, Federal agencies responsible for drafting or reviewing specifications for products to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased Intermediates—Plastic Resins.
