##### § 3201.113 Intermediates—Fibers and Fabrics. #####

These materials are used to manufacture finished products such as clothing, upholstery, or drapes.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The Federal preferred procurement product must have a minimum biobased content of at least 25 percent, which shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product.

(c) *Preference compliance date.* No later than July 10, 2019, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased Intermediates—Fibers and Fabrics. By that date, Federal agencies responsible for drafting or reviewing specifications for products to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased Intermediates—Fibers and Fabrics.
