##### § 3201.41 Metalworking fluids. #####

(a) *Definition.* (1) Fluids that are designed to provide cooling, lubrication, corrosion prevention, and reduced wear on the contact parts of machinery used for metalworking operations such as cutting, drilling, grinding, machining, and tapping.

(2) Metalworking fluids for which preferred procurement applies are:

(i) *Straight oils.* Metalworking fluids that are not diluted with water prior to use and are generally used for metalworking processes that require lubrication rather than cooling.

(ii) *General purpose soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils.* Metalworking fluids formulated for use in a re-circulating fluid system to provide cooling, lubrication, and corrosion prevention when applied to metal feedstock during normal grinding and machining operations.

(iii) *High performance soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils.* Metalworking fluids formulated for use in a re-circulating fluid system to provide cooling, lubrication, and corrosion prevention when applied to metal feedstock during grinding and machining operations involving unusually high temperatures or corrosion potential.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The minimum biobased content shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents for the preferred procurement product are:

(1) Straight oils—66 percent.

(2) General purpose soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils—57 percent.

(3) High performance soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils—40 percent.

(c) *Preference compliance date*—(1) *Straight oils.* No later than May 14, 2009, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased metalworking fluids—straight oils. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased metalworking fluids—straight oils.

(2) *General purpose soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils.* No later than May 14, 2009, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased metalworking fluids—general purpose soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased metalworking fluids—general purpose soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils.

(3) *High performance soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils.* Determination of the preference compliance date for metalworking fluids—high performance soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils is deferred until USDA identifies two or more manufacturers of biobased products within this subcategory. At that time, USDA will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing that Federal agencies have one year from the date of publication to give procurement preference to biobased metalworking fluids—high performance soluble, semi-synthetic, and synthetic oils.
