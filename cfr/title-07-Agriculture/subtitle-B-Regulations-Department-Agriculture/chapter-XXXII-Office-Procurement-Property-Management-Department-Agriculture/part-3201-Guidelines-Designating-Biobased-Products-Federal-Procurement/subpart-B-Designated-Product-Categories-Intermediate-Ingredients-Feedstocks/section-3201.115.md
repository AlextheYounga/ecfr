##### § 3201.115 Intermediates—Binders. #####

(a) *Definition.* Intermediates—Binders are materials used to provide cohesiveness throughout an entire finished product. Binders are generally polymers or polymer precursors (such as epoxies) and include the polymeric materials used to formulate coatings, adhesives, sealants, and elastomers. The product category does not include adhesives and glues that are finished products used to attach the surfaces of two or more distinct and separate components to one another.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The Federal preferred procurement product must have a minimum biobased content of at least 47 percent, which shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product.

(c) *Preference compliance date.* No later than July 10, 2019, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased Intermediates—Binders. By that date, Federal agencies responsible for drafting or reviewing specifications for products to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased Intermediates—Binders.
