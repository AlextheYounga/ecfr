##### § 3201.70 Hair care products. #####

(a) *Definitions.* (1) Personal hygiene products specifically formulated for hair cleaning and treating applications, including shampoos and conditioners.

(2) Hair care products for which Federal preferred procurement applies are:

(i) *Shampoos.* These are products whose primary purpose is cleaning hair. Products that contain both shampoos and conditioners are included in this subcategory because the primary purpose of these products is cleaning the hair.

(ii) *Conditioners.* These are products whose primary purpose is treating hair to improve the overall condition of hair.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The minimum biobased content for all hair care products shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents for the Federal preferred procurement products are:

(1) Shampoos—66 percent.

(2) Conditioners—78 percent.

(c) *Preference compliance date.* No later than July 23, 2012, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased hair care products. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased hair care products.
