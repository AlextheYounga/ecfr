##### § 3201.74 Thermal shipping containers. #####

(a) *Definitions.* (1) Insulated containers designed for shipping temperature-sensitive materials.

(2) Thermal shipping containers for which Federal preferred procurement applies are:

(i) *Durable thermal shipping container.* These are thermal shipping containers that are designed to be reused over an extended period of time.

(ii) *Non-durable thermal shipping containers.* These are thermal shipping containers that are designed to be used once.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The minimum biobased content for all thermal shipping container products shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents for the Federal preferred procurement products are:

(1) Durable thermal shipping containers—21 percent.

(2) Non-durable thermal shipping containers—82 percent.

(c) *Preference compliance date*—(1) *Durable thermal shipping containers.* Determination of the preference compliance date for durable thermal shipping containers is deferred until USDA identifies two or more manufacturers of biobased durable thermal shipping containers. At that time, USDA will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing that Federal agencies have one year from the date of publication to give procurement preference to biobased durable thermal shipping containers.

(2) *Non-durable thermal shipping containers.* Determination of the preference compliance date for non-durable thermal shipping containers is deferred until USDA identifies two or more manufacturers of biobased non-durable thermal shipping containers. At that time, USDA will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing that Federal agencies have one year from the date of publication to give procurement preference to biobased non-durable thermal shipping containers.
