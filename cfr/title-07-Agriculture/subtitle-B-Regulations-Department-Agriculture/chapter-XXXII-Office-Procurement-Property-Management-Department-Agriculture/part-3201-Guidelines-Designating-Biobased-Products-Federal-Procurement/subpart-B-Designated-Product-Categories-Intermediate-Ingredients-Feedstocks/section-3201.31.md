##### § 3201.31 Greases. #####

(a) *Definitions.* (1) Lubricants composed of oils thickened to a semisolid or solid consistency using soaps, polymers or other solids, or other thickeners.

(2) Greases for which preferred procurement applies are:

(i) *Food grade greases.* Lubricants that are designed for use on food-processing equipment as a protective anti-rust film, as a release agent on gaskets or seals of tank closures, or on machine parts and equipment in locations in which there is exposure of the lubricated part to food.

(ii) *Multipurpose greases.* Lubricants that are designed for general use.

(iii) *Rail track greases.* Lubricants that are designed for use on railroad tracks or heavy crane tracks.

(iv) *Truck greases.* Lubricants that are designed for use on the fifth wheel of tractor trailer trucks onto which the semi-trailer rests and pivots.

(v) *Greases not elsewhere specified.* Lubricants that meet the general definition of greases as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, but are not otherwise covered by paragraphs (a)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The minimum biobased content for all greases shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents are:

(1) Food grade grease—42 percent.

(2) Multipurpose grease—72 percent.

(3) Rail track grease—30 percent.

(4) Truck grease—71 percent.

(5) Greases not elsewhere specified—75 percent.

(c) *Preference compliance date.* No later than May 14, 2009, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased greases. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased greases.
