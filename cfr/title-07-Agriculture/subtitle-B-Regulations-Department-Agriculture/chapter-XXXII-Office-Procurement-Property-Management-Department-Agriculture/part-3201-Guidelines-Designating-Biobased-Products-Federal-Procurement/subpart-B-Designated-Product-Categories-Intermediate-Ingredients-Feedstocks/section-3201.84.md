(a) *Definitions.* (1) Inks are liquid or powdered materials that are available in several colors and that are used to create the visual image on a substrate when writing, printing, and copying.

(2) Inks for which Federal preferred procurement applies are:

(i) *Specialty inks.* Inks used by printers to add extra characteristics to their prints for special effects or functions. Specialty inks include, but are not limited to: CD printing, erasable, FDA compliant, invisible, magnetic, scratch and sniff, thermochromic, and tree marking inks.

(ii) *Inks (sheetfed—color).* Pigmented inks (other than black inks) used on coated and uncoated paper, paperboard, some plastic, and foil to print in color on annual reports, brochures, labels, and similar materials.

(iii) *Inks (sheetfed—black).* Black inks used on coated and uncoated paper, paperboard, some plastic, and foil to print in black on annual reports, brochures, labels, and similar materials.

(iv) *Inks (printer toner—\<25 pages per minute (ppm)).* Inks that are a powdered chemical, used in photocopying machines and laser printers, which is transferred onto paper to form the printed image. These inks are formulated to be used in printers with standard fusing mechanisms and print speeds of less than 25 ppm.

(v) *Inks (printer toner—≥25 ppm).* Inks that are a powdered chemical, used in photocopying machines and laser printers, which is transferred onto paper to form the printed image. These inks are formulated to be used in printers with advanced fusing mechanisms and print speeds of 25 ppm or greater.

(vi) *Inks (news).* Inks used primarily to print newspapers.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The minimum biobased content for all inks shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents for the Federal preferred procurement products are:

(1) *Specialty inks*—66 percent.

(2) *Inks (sheetfed—color)*—67 percent.

(3) *Inks (sheetfed—black)*—49 percent.

(4) *Inks (printer toner—\<25 ppm)*—34 percent.

(5) *Inks (printer toner—≥25 ppm)*—20 percent.

(6) *Inks (news)*—32 percent.

(c) *Preference compliance date.* No later than April 4, 2013, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased inks. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for products to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased inks.
