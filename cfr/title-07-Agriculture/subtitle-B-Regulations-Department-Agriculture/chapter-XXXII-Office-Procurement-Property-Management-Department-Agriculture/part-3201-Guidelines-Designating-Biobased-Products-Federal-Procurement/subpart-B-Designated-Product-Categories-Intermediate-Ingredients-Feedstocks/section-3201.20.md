##### § 3201.20 Fluid-filled transformers. #####

(a) *Definition*—(1) *Synthetic ester-based fluid-filled transformers.* Electric power transformers that are designed to utilize a synthetic ester-based dielectric (non-conducting) fluid to provide insulating and cooling properties.

(2) *Vegetable oil-based fluid-filled transformers.* Electric power transformers that are designed to utilize a vegetable oil-based dielectric (non-conducting) fluid to provide insulating and cooling properties.

(b) *Minimum biobased content.* The minimum biobased content requirement for all fluid-filled transformers shall be based on the amount of qualifying biobased carbon in the product as a percent of the weight (mass) of the total organic carbon in the finished product. The applicable minimum biobased contents are:

(1) Synthetic ester-based fluid-filled transformers—66 percent.

(2) Vegetable oil-based fluid-filled transformers—95 percent.

(c) *Preference compliance date*—(1) *Synthetic ester-based fluid-filled transformers.* Determination of the compliance date for synthetic ester-based fluid-filled transformers is deferred until USDA identifies two or more manufacturers of synthetic ester-based fluid-filled transformers. At that time, USDA will publish a document in the Federal Register announcing that Federal agencies have one year from the date of publication to give procurement preference to biobased synthetic ester-based fluid-filled transformers.

(2) *Vegetable oil-based fluid-filled transformers.* No later than May 14, 2009, procuring agencies, in accordance with this part, will give a procurement preference for qualifying biobased vegetable oil-based fluid-filled transformers. By that date, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for items to be procured shall ensure that the relevant specifications require the use of biobased vegetable oil-based fluid-filled transformers.
