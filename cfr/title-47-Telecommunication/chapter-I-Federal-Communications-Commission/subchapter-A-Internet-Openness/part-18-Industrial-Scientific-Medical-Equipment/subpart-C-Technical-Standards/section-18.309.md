##### ยง 18.309 Frequency range of measurements. #####

(a) For field strength measurements:

|Frequency band in which device operates (MHz)|                    Range of frequency measurements                    |                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|              Lowest frequency               |                           Highest frequency                           |                                                 |
|                 Below 1.705                 |  Lowest frequency generated in the device, but not lower than 9 kHz   |                     30 MHz.                     |
|                 1.705 to 30                 |  Lowest frequency generated in the device, but not lower than 9 kHz   |                    400 MHz.                     |
|                  30 to 500                  |Lowest frequency generated in the device or 25 MHz, whichever is lower |Tenth harmonic or 1,000 MHz, whichever is higher.|
|                500 to 1,000                 |Lowest frequency generated in the device or 100 MHz, whichever is lower|                 Tenth harmonic.                 |
|                 Above 1,000                 |                               ......do                                | Tenth harmonic or highest detectable emission.  |

(b) For conducted powerline measurements, the frequency range over which the limits are specified will be scanned.
