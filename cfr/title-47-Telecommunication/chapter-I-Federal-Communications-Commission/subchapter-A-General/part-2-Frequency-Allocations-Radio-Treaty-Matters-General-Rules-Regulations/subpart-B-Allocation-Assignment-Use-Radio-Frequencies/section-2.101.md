##### § 2.101 Frequency and wavelength bands. #####

(a) The radio spectrum shall be subdivided into nine frequency bands, which shall be designated by progressive whole numbers in accordance with the following table. As the unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz), frequencies shall be expressed:

(1) In kilohertz (kHz), up to and including 3 000 kHz;

(2) In megahertz (MHz), above 3 MHz, up to and including 3 000 MHz;

(3) In gigahertz (GHz), above 3 GHz, up to and including 3 000 GHz.

(b) However, where adherence to these provisions would introduce serious difficulties, for example in connection with the notification and registration of frequencies, the lists of frequencies and related matters, reasonable departures may be made.1

1 In the application of the ITU *Radio Regulations,* the Radiocommunication Bureau uses the following units:

kHz: For frequencies up to 28 000 kHz inclusive;

MHz: For frequencies above 28 000 kHz up to 10 500 MHz inclusive; and

GHz: For frequencies above 10 500 MHz.
