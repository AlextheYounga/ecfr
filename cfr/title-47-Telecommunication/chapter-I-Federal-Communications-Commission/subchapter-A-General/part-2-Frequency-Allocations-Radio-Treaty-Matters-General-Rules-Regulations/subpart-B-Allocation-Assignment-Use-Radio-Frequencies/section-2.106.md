                                                                                                                                                                                (a) Airborne and space-to-Earth operations are prohibited.

                                                                                                                                                                                (b) Federal operations (except for devices authorized by the FCC for the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service) are on a non-interference basis to non-Federal operations and shall not constrain implementation of non-Federal operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US80 Federal stations may use the frequency 122.9 MHz subject to the following conditions: (a) All operations by Federal stations shall be restricted to the purpose for which the frequency is authorized to non-Federal stations, and shall be in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Commission's Rules and Regulations, Part 87, Aviation Services; (b) Use of the frequency is required for coordination of activities with Commission licensees operating on this frequency; and (c) Federal stations will not be authorized for operation at fixed locations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US81 The band 38-38.25 MHz is used by both Federal and non-Federal radio astronomy observatories. No new fixed or mobile assignments are to be made and Federal stations in the band 38-38.25 MHz will be moved to other bands on a case-by-case basis, as required, to protect radio astronomy observations from harmful interference. As an exception, however, low powered military transportable and mobile stations used for tactical and training purposes will continue to use the band. To the extent practicable, the latter operations will be adjusted to relieve such interference as may be caused to radio astronomy observations. In the event of harmful interference from such local operations, radio astronomy observatories may contact local military commands directly, with a view to effecting relief. A list of military commands, areas of coordination, and points of contact for purposes of relieving interference may be obtained upon request from the Office of Engineering and Technology, FCC, Washington, DC 20554.

                                                                                                                                                                                US82 In the bands 4146-4152 kHz, 6224-6233 kHz, 8294-8300 kHz, 12353-12368 kHz, 16528-16549 kHz, 18825-18846 kHz, 22159-22180 kHz, and 25100-25121 kHz, the assignable frequencies may be authorized on a shared non-priority basis to Federal and non-Federal ship and coast stations (SSB telephony, with peak envelope power not to exceed 1 kW).

                                                                                                                                                                                US83 In the 1432-1435 MHz band, Federal stations in the fixed and mobile services may operate indefinitely on a primary basis at the 22 sites listed in the table below. The first 21 sites are in the United States and the last site is in Guam (GU). All other Federal stations in the fixed and mobile services shall operate in the band 1432-1435 MHz on a primary basis until re-accommodated in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1999.

Use at Cape Canaveral AFS is restricted to launch support only. If required, successfully coordinated with all affected AWS licensees, and authorized by NTIA, reasonable modifications of these grandfathered Federal systems beyond their current authorizations or the addition of new earth station locations may be permitted. The details of the coordination must be filed with NTIA and FCC.

                                                                                                                                                                                (c) In the band 1755-1780 MHz, the military services may conduct Electronic Warfare (EW) operations on Federal ranges and within associated airspace on a non-interference basis with respect to non-Federal AWS operations and shall not constrain implementation of non-Federal AWS operations. This use is restricted to Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), training, and Large Force Exercise (LFE) operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US92 In the band 2025-2110 MHz, Federal use of the co-primary fixed and mobile services is restricted to the military services and the following provisions apply:

                                                                                                                                                                                (a) Federal use shall not cause harmful interference to, nor constrain the deployment and use of the band by, the Television Broadcast Auxiliary Service, the Cable Television Relay Service, or the Local Television Transmission Service. To facilitate compatible operations, coordination is required in accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding between Federal and non-Federal fixed and mobile operations. Non-Federal licensees shall make all reasonable efforts to accommodate military mobile and fixed operations; however, the use of the band 2025-2110 MHz by the non-Federal fixed and mobile services has priority over military fixed and mobile operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                (b) Military stations should, to the extent practicable, employ frequency agile technologies and techniques, including the capability to tune to other frequencies and the use of a modular retrofit capability, to facilitate sharing of this band with incumbent Federal and non-Federal operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US93 In the conterminous United States, the frequency 108.0 MHz may be authorized for use by VOR test facilities, the operation of which is not essential for the safety of life or property, subject to the condition that no interference is caused to the reception of FM broadcasting stations operating in the band 88-108 MHz. In the event that such interference does occur, the licensee or other agency authorized to operate the facility shall discontinue operation on 108 MHz and shall not resume operation until the interference has been eliminated or the complaint otherwise satisfied. VOR test facilities operating on 108 MHz will not be protected against interference caused by FM broadcasting stations operating in the band 88-108 MHz nor shall the authorization of a VOR test facility on 108 MHz preclude the Commission from authorizing additional FM broadcasting stations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US97 The following provisions shall apply in the band 2305-2320 MHz:

                                                                                                                                                                                (a) In the sub-band 2305-2310 MHz, space-to-Earth operations are prohibited.

                                                                                                                                                                                (b) Within 145 km of Goldstone, CA (35°25′33″ N, 116°53′23″ W), Wireless Communications Service (WCS) licensees operating base stations in the band 2305-2320 MHz shall, prior to operation of those base stations, achieve a mutually satisfactory coordination agreement with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

                                                                                                                                                                                (a) The bands 2310-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz are available for Federal aeronautical telemetering and associated telecommand operations for flight testing of manned or unmanned aircraft, missiles, or major components thereof, on a secondary basis to the Wireless Communications Service (WCS). The frequencies 2312.5 MHz and 2352.5 MHz are shared on a co-equal basis by Federal stations for telemetering and associated telecommand operations of expendable and reusable launch vehicles, irrespective of whether such operations involve flight testing. Other Federal mobile telemetering uses may be provided in the bands 2310-2320 and 2345-2360 MHz on a non-interference basis to all other uses authorized pursuant to this footnote.

                                                                                                                                                                                (b) The band 2345-2360 MHz is available for non-Federal aeronautical telemetering and associated telecommand operations for flight testing of manned or unmanned aircraft, missiles, or major components thereof, on a secondary basis to the WCS until January 1, 2020. The use of this allocation is restricted to non-Federal licensees in the Aeronautical and Fixed Radio Service holding a valid authorization on April 23, 2015.

                                                                                                                                                                                US101 The band 2360-2400 MHz is also allocated on a secondary basis to the mobile, except aeronautical mobile, service. The use of this allocation is limited to MedRadio operations. MedRadio stations are authorized by rule and operate in accordance with 47 CFR part 95.

                                                                                                                                                                                US102 In Alaska only, the frequency 122.1 MHz may also be used for air carrier air traffic control purposes at locations where other frequencies are not available to air carrier aircraft stations for air traffic control.

                                                                                                                                                                                US104 In the band 90-110 kHz, the LORAN radionavigation system has priority in the United States and its insular areas. Radiolocation land stations making use of LORAN type equipment may be authorized to both Federal and non-Federal licensees on a secondary basis for offshore radiolocation activities only at specific locations and subject to such technical and operational conditions (e.g., power, emission, pulse rate and phase code, hours of operation), including on-the-air testing, as may be required on a case-by-case basis to ensure protection of the LORAN radionavigation system from harmful interference and to ensure mutual compatibility among radiolocation operators. Such authorizations to stations in the radiolocation service are further subject to showing of need for service which is not currently provided and which the Federal Government is not yet prepared to render by way of the radionavigation service.

                                                                                                                                                                                US105 In the band 3550-3650 MHz, non-Federal stations in the radiolocation service that were licensed or applied for prior to July 23, 2015 may continue to operate on a secondary basis until the end of the equipment's useful lifetime.

                                                                                                                                                                                US107 In the band 3600-3650 MHz, the following provisions shall apply to earth stations in the fixed-satellite service (space-to-Earth):

                                                                                                                                                                                (a) In the band 5000-5010 MHz, systems in the aeronautical mobile (R) service (AM(R)S) are limited to surface applications at airports that operate in accordance with international aeronautical standards (*i.e.,* AeroMACS).

                                                                                                                                                                                (b) The band 5010-5030 MHz is also allocated on a primary basis to the AM(R)S, limited to surface applications at airports that operate in accordance with international aeronautical standards. In making assignments for this band, attempts shall first be made to satisfy the AM(R)S requirements in the bands 5000-5010 MHz and 5091-5150 MHz. AM(R)S systems used in the band 5010-5030 MHz shall be designed and implemented to be capable of operational modification if receiving harmful interference from the radionavigation-satellite service. Finally, notwithstanding Radio Regulation No. 4.10, stations in the AM(R)S operating in this band shall be designed and implemented to be capable of operational modification to reduce throughput and/or preclude the use of specific frequencies in order to ensure protection of radionavigation-satellite service systems operating in this band.

                                                                                                                                                                                (c) Aeronautical fixed communications that are an integral part of the AeroMACS system in the bands 5000-5010 MHz and 5010-5030 MHz are also authorized on a primary basis.

Federal assignments existing prior to July 10, 1970, shall be on a secondary basis to stations in the non-Federal land mobile service and shall be subject to adjustment or removal from the bands 890-902 MHz, 928-932 MHz, and 935-941 MHz at the request of the FCC.

G5 In the bands 162.0125-173.2, 173.4-174, 406.1-410 and 410-420 MHz, use by the military services is limited by the provisions specified in the channeling plans shown in Sections 4.3.7 and 4.3.9 of the NTIA Manual.

G6 Military tactical fixed and mobile operations may be conducted nationally on a secondary basis: (a) To the meteorological aids service in the band 403-406 MHz; and (b) To the radio astronomy service in the band 406.1-410 MHz. Such fixed and mobile operations are subject to local coordination to ensure that harmful interference will not be caused to the services to which the bands are allocated.

G8 Low power Federal radio control operations are permitted in the band 420-450 MHz.

G11 Federal fixed and mobile radio services, including low power radio control operations, are permitted in the band 902-928 MHz on a secondary basis.

G15 Use of the band 2700-2900 MHz by the military fixed and shipborne air defense radiolocation installations will be fully coordinated with the meteorological aids and aeronautical radionavigation services. The military air defense installations will be moved from the band 2700-2900 MHz at the earliest practicable date. Until such time as military air defense installations can be accommodated satisfactorily elsewhere in the spectrum, such operations will, insofar as practicable, be adjusted to meet the requirements of the aeronautical radionavigation service.

G19 Use of the band 9000-9200 MHz by military fixed and shipborne air defense radiolocation installations will be fully coordinated with the aeronautical radionavigation service, recognizing fully the safety aspects of the latter. Military air defense installations will be accommodated ultimately outside this band. Until such time as military defense installations can be accommodated satisfactorily elsewhere in the spectrum such operations will, insofar as practicable, be adjusted to meet the requirements of the aeronautical radionavigation services.

G27 In the bands 225-328.6 MHz, 335.4-399.9 MHz, and 1350-1390 MHz, the fixed and mobile services are limited to the military systems.

G30 In the bands 138-144 MHz, 148-149.9 MHz, and 150.05-150.8 MHz, the fixed and mobile services are limited primarily to operations by the military services.

G32 Except for weather radars on meteorological satellites in the band 9975-10025 MHz and for Federal survey operations (see footnote US108), Federal radiolocation in the band 10-10.5 GHz is limited to the military services.

G34 In the band 34.4-34.5 GHz, weather radars on board meteorological satellites for cloud detection are authorized to operate on the basis of equality with military radiolocation devices. All other non-military radiolocation in the band 33.4-36.0 GHz shall be secondary to the military services.

G42 The space operation service (Earth-to-space) is limited to the band 1761-1842 MHz, and is limited to space command, control, range and range rate systems.

G56 Federal radiolocation in the bands 1215-1300, 2900-3100, 5350-5650 and 9300-9500 MHz is primarily for the military services; however, limited secondary use is permitted by other Federal agencies in support of experimentation and research programs. In addition, limited secondary use is permitted for survey operations in the band 2900-3100 MHz.

G59 In the bands 902-928 MHz, 3100-3300 MHz, 3500-3650 MHz, 5250-5350 MHz, 8500-9000 MHz, 9200-9300 MHz, 13.4-14.0 GHz, 15.7-17.7 GHz and 24.05-24.25 GHz, all Federal non-military radiolocation shall be secondary to military radiolocation, except in the sub-band 15.7-16.2 GHz airport surface detection equipment (ASDE) is permitted on a co-equal basis subject to coordination with the military departments.

G100 The bands 235-322 MHz and 335.4-399.9 MHz are also allocated on a primary basis to the mobile-satellite service, limited to military operations.

G104 In the bands 7450-7550 and 8175-8215 MHz, it is agreed that although the military space radio communication systems, which include earth stations near the proposed meteorological-satellite installations will precede the meteorological-satellite installations, engineering adjustments to either the military or the meteorological-satellite systems or both will be made as mutually required to assure compatible operations of the systems concerned.

G109 All assignments in the band 157.0375-157.1875 MHz are subject to adjustment to other frequencies in this band as long term U.S. maritime VHF planning develops, particularly that planning incident to support of the National VHF-FM Radiotelephone Safety and Distress System (See Doc. 15624/1-1.9.111/1.9.125).

G110 Federal ground-based stations in the aeronautical radionavigation service may be authorized between 3500-3650 MHz when accommodation in the band 2700-2900 MHz is not technically and/or economically feasible.

G114 The band 1369.05-1390 MHz is also allocated to the fixed-satellite service (space-to-Earth) and to the mobile-satellite service (space-to-Earth) on a primary basis for the relay of nuclear burst data.

G115 In the band 13360-13410 kHz, the fixed service is allocated on a primary basis outside the conterminous United States. Within the conterminous United States, assignments in the fixed service are permitted, and will be protected for national defense purposes or, if they are to be used only in an emergency jeopardizing life, public safety, or important property under conditions calling for immediate communication where other means of communication do not exist.

G116 The band 7125-7155 MHz is also allocated for earth-to-space transmissions in the Space Operations Service at a limited number of sites (not to exceed two), subject to established coordination procedures.

G117 In the bands 7.25-7.75 GHz, 7.9-8.4 GHz, 17.375-17.475 GHz, 17.6-21.2 GHz, 30-31 GHz, 33-36 GHz, 39.5-41 GHz, 43.5-45.5 GHz, and 50.4-51.4 GHz, the Federal fixed-satellite and mobile-satellite services are limited to military systems.

G120 Development of airborne primary radars in the band 2360-2390 MHz with peak transmitter power in excess of 250 watts for use in the United States is not permitted.

G122 In the bands 2300-2310 MHz, 2395-2400 MHz, 2400-2417 MHz, and 4940-4990 MHz, Federal operations may be authorized on a non-interference basis to authorized non-Federal operations, and shall not constrain the implementation of any non-Federal operations.

G127 Federal Travelers Information Stations (TIS) on 1610 kHz have coprimary status with AM Broadcast assignments. Federal TIS authorized as of August 4, 1994, preclude subsequent assignment for conflicting allotments.

G128 Use of the band 56.9-57 GHz by inter-satellite systems is limited to transmissions between satellites in geostationary orbit, to transmissions between satellites in geostationary satellite orbit and those in high-Earth orbit, to transmissions from satellites in geostationary satellite orbit to those in low-Earth orbit, and to transmissions from non-geostationary satellites in high-Earth orbit to those in low-Earth orbit. For links between satellites in the geostationary satellite orbit, the single entry power flux-density at all altitudes from 0 km to 1000 km above the Earth's surface, for all conditions and for all methods of modulation, shall not exceed −147 dB (W/m2/100 MHz) for all angles of arrival.

G129 Federal wind profilers are authorized to operate on a primary basis in the radiolocation service in the frequency band 448-450 MHz with an authorized bandwidth of no more than 2 MHz centered on 449 MHz, subject to the following conditions: (1) wind profiler locations must be pre-coordinated with the military services to protect fixed military radars; and (2) wind profiler operations shall not cause harmful interference to, nor claim protection from, military mobile radiolocation stations that are engaged in critical national defense operations.

G130 Federal stations in the radiolocation service operating in the band 5350-5470 MHz, shall not cause harmful interference to, nor claim protection from, Federal stations in the aeronautical radionavigation service operating in accordance with ITU Radio Regulation No. 5.449.

G131 Federal stations in the radiolocation service operating in the band 5470-5650 MHz, with the exception of ground-based radars used for meteorological purposes operating in the band 5600-5650 MHz, shall not cause harmful interference to, nor claim protection from, Federal stations in the maritime radionavigation service.

G132 Use of the radionavigation-satellite service in the band 1215-1240 MHz shall be subject to the condition that no harmful interference is caused to, and no protection is claimed from, the radionavigation service authorized under ITU Radio Regulation No. 5.331. Furthermore, the use of the radionavigation-satellite service in the band 1215-1240 MHz shall be subject to the condition that no harmful interference is caused to the radiolocation service. ITU Radio Regulation No. 5.43 shall not apply in respect of the radiolocation service. ITU Resolution 608 (Rev.WRC-15) shall apply.
