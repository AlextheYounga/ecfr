                                                                                                                                                                                US79 In the bands 1390-1400 MHz and 1427-1432 MHz, the following provisions shall apply:

                                                                                                                                                                                (a) Airborne and space-to-Earth operations are prohibited.

                                                                                                                                                                                (b) Federal operations (except for devices authorized by the FCC for the Wireless Medical Telemetry Service) are on a non-interference basis to non-Federal operations and shall not constrain implementation of non-Federal operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US80 Federal stations may use the frequency 122.9 MHz subject to the following conditions: (a) All operations by Federal stations shall be restricted to the purpose for which the frequency is authorized to non-Federal stations, and shall be in accordance with the appropriate provisions of the Commission's Rules and Regulations, Part 87, Aviation Services; (b) Use of the frequency is required for coordination of activities with Commission licensees operating on this frequency; and (c) Federal stations will not be authorized for operation at fixed locations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US81 The band 38-38.25 MHz is used by both Federal and non-Federal radio astronomy observatories. No new fixed or mobile assignments are to be made and Federal stations in the band 38-38.25 MHz will be moved to other bands on a case-by-case basis, as required, to protect radio astronomy observations from harmful interference. As an exception, however, low powered military transportable and mobile stations used for tactical and training purposes will continue to use the band. To the extent practicable, the latter operations will be adjusted to relieve such interference as may be caused to radio astronomy observations. In the event of harmful interference from such local operations, radio astronomy observatories may contact local military commands directly, with a view to effecting relief. A list of military commands, areas of coordination, and points of contact for purposes of relieving interference may be obtained upon request from the Office of Engineering and Technology, FCC, Washington, DC 20554.

                                                                                                                                                                                US82 In the bands 4146-4152 kHz, 6224-6233 kHz, 8294-8300 kHz, 12353-12368 kHz, 16528-16549 kHz, 18825-18846 kHz, 22159-22180 kHz, and 25100-25121 kHz, the assignable frequencies may be authorized on a shared non-priority basis to Federal and non-Federal ship and coast stations (SSB telephony, with peak envelope power not to exceed 1 kW).

                                                                                                                                                                                US83 In the 1432-1435 MHz band, Federal stations in the fixed and mobile services may operate indefinitely on a primary basis at the 22 sites listed in the table below. The first 21 sites are in the United States and the last site is in Guam (GU). All other Federal stations in the fixed and mobile services shall operate in the band 1432-1435 MHz on a primary basis until re-accommodated in accordance with the National Defense Authorization Act of 1999.

Use at Cape Canaveral AFS is restricted to launch support only. If required, successfully coordinated with all affected AWS licensees, and authorized by NTIA, reasonable modifications of these grandfathered Federal systems beyond their current authorizations or the addition of new earth station locations may be permitted. The details of the coordination must be filed with NTIA and FCC.

                                                                                                                                                                                (c) In the band 1755-1780 MHz, the military services may conduct Electronic Warfare (EW) operations on Federal ranges and within associated airspace on a non-interference basis with respect to non-Federal AWS operations and shall not constrain implementation of non-Federal AWS operations. This use is restricted to Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E), training, and Large Force Exercise (LFE) operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US92 In the band 2025-2110 MHz, Federal use of the co-primary fixed and mobile services is restricted to the military services and the following provisions apply:

                                                                                                                                                                                (a) Federal use shall not cause harmful interference to, nor constrain the deployment and use of the band by, the Television Broadcast Auxiliary Service, the Cable Television Relay Service, or the Local Television Transmission Service. To facilitate compatible operations, coordination is required in accordance with a Memorandum of Understanding between Federal and non-Federal fixed and mobile operations. Non-Federal licensees shall make all reasonable efforts to accommodate military mobile and fixed operations; however, the use of the band 2025-2110 MHz by the non-Federal fixed and mobile services has priority over military fixed and mobile operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                (b) Military stations should, to the extent practicable, employ frequency agile technologies and techniques, including the capability to tune to other frequencies and the use of a modular retrofit capability, to facilitate sharing of this band with incumbent Federal and non-Federal operations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US93 In the conterminous United States, the frequency 108.0 MHz may be authorized for use by VOR test facilities, the operation of which is not essential for the safety of life or property, subject to the condition that no interference is caused to the reception of FM broadcasting stations operating in the band 88-108 MHz. In the event that such interference does occur, the licensee or other agency authorized to operate the facility shall discontinue operation on 108 MHz and shall not resume operation until the interference has been eliminated or the complaint otherwise satisfied. VOR test facilities operating on 108 MHz will not be protected against interference caused by FM broadcasting stations operating in the band 88-108 MHz nor shall the authorization of a VOR test facility on 108 MHz preclude the Commission from authorizing additional FM broadcasting stations.

                                                                                                                                                                                US97 The following provisions shall apply in the band 2305-2320 MHz:

                                                                                                                                                                                (b) The band 5010-5030 MHz is also allocated on a primary basis to the AM(R)S, limited to surface applications at airports that operate in accordance with international aeronautical standards. In making assignments for this band, attempts shall first be made to satisfy the AM(R)S requirements in the bands 5000-5010 MHz and 5091-5150 MHz. AM(R)S systems used in the band 5010-5030 MHz shall be designed and implemented to be capable of operational modification if receiving harmful interference from the radionavigation-satellite service. Finally, notwithstanding Radio Regulation No. 4.10, stations in the AM(R)S operating in this band shall be designed and implemented to be capable of operational modification to reduce throughput and/or preclude the use of specific frequencies in order to ensure protection of radionavigation-satellite service systems operating in this band.

                                                                                                                                                                                (c) Aeronautical fixed communications that are an integral part of the AeroMACS system in the bands 5000-5010 MHz and 5010-5030 MHz are also authorized on a primary basis.

                                                                                                                                                                                US116 In the bands 890-902 MHz and 935-941 MHz, no new assignments are to be made to Federal radio stations after July 10, 1970, except on a case-by-case basis to experimental stations. Federal assignments existing prior to July 10, 1970, shall be on a secondary basis to stations in the non-Federal land mobile service and shall be subject to adjustment or removal from the bands 890-902 MHz, 928-932 MHz, and 935-941 MHz at the request of the FCC.

                                                                                                                                                                                US117 In the band 406.1-410 MHz, the following provisions shall apply:
