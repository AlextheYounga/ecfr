##### § 2.302 Call signs. #####

The table which follows indicates the composition and blocks of international call signs available for assignment when such call signs are required by the rules pertaining to particular classes of stations. When stations operating in two or more classes are authorized to the same licensee for the same location, the Commission may elect to assign a separate call sign to each station in a different class. (In addition to the U.S. call sign allocations listed below, call sign blocks AAA through AEZ and ALA through ALZ have been assigned to the Department of the Army; call sign block AFA through AKZ has been assigned to the Department of the Air Force; and call sign block NAA through NZZ has been assigned jointly to the Department of the Navy and the U.S. Coast. Guard.
