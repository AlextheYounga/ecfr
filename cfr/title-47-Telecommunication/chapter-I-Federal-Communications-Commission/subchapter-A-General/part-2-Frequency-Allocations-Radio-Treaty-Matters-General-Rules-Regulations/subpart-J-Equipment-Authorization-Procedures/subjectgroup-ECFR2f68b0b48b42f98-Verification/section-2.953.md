##### § 2.953 Responsibility for compliance. #####

(a) In verifying compliance, the responsible party, as defined in § 2.909 warrants that each unit of equipment marketed under the verification procedure will be identical to the unit tested and found acceptable with the standards and that the records maintained by the responsible party continue to reflect the equipment being produced under such verification within the variation that can be expected due to quantity production and testing on a statistical basis.

(b) The importer of equipment subject to verification may, upon receiving a written statement from the manufacturer that the equipment complies with the appropriate technical standards, rely on the manufacturer or independent testing agency to verify compliance. The test records required by § 2.955 however should be in the English language and made available to the Commission upon a reasonable request, in accordance with § 2.945.

(c) In the case of transfer of control of equipment, as in the case of sale or merger of the grantee, the new manufacturer or importer shall bear the responsibility of continued compliance of the equipment.

(d) Verified equipment shall be reverified if any modification or change adversely affects the emanation characteristics of the modified equipment. The party designated in § 2.909 bears responsibility for continued compliance of subsequently produced equipment.
