##### § 2.201 Emission, modulation, and transmission characteristics. #####

The following system of designating emission, modulation, and transmission characteristics shall be employed.

(a) Emissions are designated according to their classification and their necessary bandwidth.

(b) Three symbols are used to describe the basic characteristics of emissions. Emissions are classified and symbolized according to the following characteristics:

(1) First symbol—type of modulation of the main carrier;

(2) Second symbol—nature of signal(s) modulating the main carrier;

(3) Third symbol—type of information to be transmitted.

Note to paragraph (b):

Two additional symbols for the classification of emissions may be added for a more complete description of an emission. *See* Appendix 1, Sub-Section IIB of the ITU *Radio Regulations* for the specifications of these fourth and fifth symbols. Use of these symbols is not required by the Commission.

(c) First Symbol—types of modulation of the main carrier:
