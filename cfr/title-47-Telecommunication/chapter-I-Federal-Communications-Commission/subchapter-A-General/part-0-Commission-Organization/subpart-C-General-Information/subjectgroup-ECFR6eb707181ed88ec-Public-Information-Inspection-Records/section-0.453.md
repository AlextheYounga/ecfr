##### ยง 0.453 Public reference rooms. #####

The Commission's main Web site at *http://www.fcc.gov* and its electronic reading room at *http://www.fcc.gov/general/freedom-information-act-electronic-reading-room* host the Commission's online public reference room. The Commission also maintains the FCC Reference Information Center as its public reference room at its offices in Washington, DC.

(a) The Reference Information Center maintains files containing the record of all docketed cases, petitions for rule making and related papers. A file is maintained for each docketed hearing case and for each docketed rule making proceeding. Cards summarizing the history of such cases for the years before 1984 are available for inspection. Information summarizing the history of such cases for the years from 1984 through present is available online on the Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS). ECFS serves as the repository for official filings in the FCC's docketed proceedings from 1992 to the present. The public can use ECFS to retrieve any document in the system, including selected pre-1992 documents.

(b) The Commission will maintain a regularly updated listing of other routinely available records in its electronic reading room at *http://www.fcc.gov/general/freedom-information-act-electronic-reading-room*.
