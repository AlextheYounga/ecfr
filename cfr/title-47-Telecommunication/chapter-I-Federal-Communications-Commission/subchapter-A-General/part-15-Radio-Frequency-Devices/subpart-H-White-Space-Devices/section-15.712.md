The separation distances in this section apply to fixed and personal/portable white space devices with a location accuracy of ±50 meters. These distances must be increased by the amount that the location uncertainty of a white space device exceeds ±50 meters.

(a) *Digital television stations, and digital and analog Class A TV, low power TV, TV translator and TV booster stations* - (1) *Protected contour.* White space devices must protect digital and analog TV services within the contours shown in the following table. These contours are calculated using the methodology in § 73.684 of this chapter and the R-6602 curves contained in § 73.699 of this chapter.

|                                                                  |    UHF (14-51)    |       41        |F(50,90)|

(2) *Required separation distance.* White space devices must be located outside the contours indicated in paragraph (a)(1) of this section of co-channel and adjacent channel stations by at least the minimum distances specified in the following tables.

(i) If a device operates between two defined power levels, it must comply with the separation distances for the higher power level.

(ii) White space devices operating at 40 mW EIRP or less are not required to meet the adjacent channel separation distances.

(iii) Fixed white space devices operating at 100 mW EIRP or less per 6 megahertz across multiple contiguous TV channels with at least 3 megahertz separation between the frequency band occupied by the white space device and adjacent TV channels are not required to meet the adjacent channel separation distances.

(iv) Fixed white space devices may only operate above 4 W EIRP in less congested areas as defined in § 15.703(h).

Only channels received over the air and used by the MVPD, TV translator station or low power/Class A TV station may be registered.

(2) White space devices may not operate within an arc of ±30 degrees from a line between a registered receive site and the contour of the TV station being received in the direction of the station's transmitter at a distance of up to 80 km from the edge of the protected contour of the received TV station for co-channel operation and up to 20 km from the registered receive site for adjacent channel operation, except that the protection distance shall not exceed the distance from the receive site to the protected contour.

(3) Outside of the ±30 degree arc defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section:

(i) White space devices operating at 4 watts EIRP or less may not operate within 8 km from the receive site for co-channel operation and 2 km from the receive site for adjacent channel operation.

(ii) White Space devices operating with more than 4 watts EIRP may not operate within 10.2 km from the receive site for co-channel operation and 2.5 km from the receive site for adjacent channel operation.

(iii) For purposes of this section, a TV station being received may include a full power TV station, TV translator station or low power TV/Class A TV station.

(c) *Fixed Broadcast Auxiliary Service (BAS) links.* (1) For permanent BAS receive sites appearing in the Commission's Universal Licensing System or temporary BAS receive sites registered in the white space database, white space devices may not operate within an arc of ±30 degrees from a line between the BAS receive site and its associated permanent transmitter within a distance of 80 km from the receive site for co-channel operation and 20 km for adjacent channel operation.

(2) Outside of the ±30 degree arc defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section:

(i) White space devices operating at 4 watts EIRP or less may not operate within 8 km from the receive site for co-channel operation and 2 km from the receive site for adjacent channel operation.

(ii) White Space devices operating with more than 4 watts EIRP may not operate within 10.2 km from the receive site for co-channel operation and 2.5 km from the receive site for adjacent channel operation.

(d) *PLMRS/CMRS operations.* (1) White space devices may not operate at distances less than those specified in the table below from the coordinates of the metropolitan areas and on the channels listed in § 90.303(a) of this chapter.

(3) Operation within the band 608-614 MHz is prohibited within the following areas:

(i) The National Radio Quiet Zone as defined in § 1.924(a)(1) of this chapter.

(ii) The islands of Puerto Rico, Desecheo, Mona, Vieques or Culebra

(i) *600 MHz service band:* Fixed and personal/portable devices operating in the 600 MHz Service Band must comply with the following co-channel and adjacent channel separation distances outside the defined polygonal area encompassing the base stations or other radio facilities deployed by a part 27 600 MHz Service Band licensee that has commenced operations, as defined in § 27.4 of this chapter.

(1) Fixed white space devices may only operate above 4 W EIRP in less congested areas as defined in § 15.703(h).

(2) If a device operates between two defined power levels, it must comply with the separation distances for the higher power level.

(3) For the purpose of this rule, co-channel means any frequency overlap between a channel used by a white space device and a five megahertz spectrum block used by a part 27 600 MHz band licensee, and adjacent channel means a frequency separation of zero to four megahertz between the edge of a channel used by a white space device and the edge of a five megahertz spectrum block used by a part 27 600 MHz band licensee.

(4) On frequencies used by wireless uplink services:
