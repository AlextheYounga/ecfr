(a)(1) All white space devices are permitted to operate on available channels in the frequency bands 470-698 MHz (TV channels 14-51), subject to the interference protection requirements in §§ 15.711 and 15.712, except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(2) White space devices are not permitted to operate on the first channel above and below TV channel 37 (608-614 MHz) that are available (*i.e.,* not occupied by an authorized service) until June 23, 2017, but no later than release of the Channel Reassignment Public Notice upon completion of the broadcast television spectrum incentive auction, as defined in § 73.3700(a) of this chapter. If a channel is not available both above and below channel 37, operation is prohibited on the first two channels nearest to channel 37. These channels will be identified and protected in the white space database(s).

(3) *600 MHz guard band.* In the 600 MHz guard band between television and 600 MHz service downlink bands, white space devices may only operate immediately adjacent to the television band with a maximum bandwidth of 6 megahertz. White space devices are prohibited from operating in the three megahertz segment adjacent to the 600 MHz service band.

(4) *600 MHz duplex gap.* In the 600 MHz duplex gap, white space devices shall only operate in the 6 megahertz segment immediately adjacent to the 600 MHz service uplink band.

(5) *600 MHz service band.* White space devices may operate on frequencies in the 600 MHz service band in areas where 600 MHz band licensees have not commenced operations, as defined in § 27.4 of this chapter.

(6) *Channel 37 guard band.* White space devices are not permitted to operate in either three megahertz segment above or below channel 37 if that spectrum is adjacent to the 600 MHz service band.

(b) Only fixed white space devices that communicate only with other fixed white space devices may operate on available channels in the bands 54-72 MHz (TV channels 2-4), 76-88 MHz (TV channels 5 and 6), and 174-216 MHz (TV channels 7-13), subject to the interference protection requirements in §§ 15.711 and 15.712.
