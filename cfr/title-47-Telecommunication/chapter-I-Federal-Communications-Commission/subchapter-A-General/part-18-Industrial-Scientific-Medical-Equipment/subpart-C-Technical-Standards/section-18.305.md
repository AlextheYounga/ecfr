Notes

1. The tighter limit shall apply at the boundary between two frequency ranges.

2. Testing for compliance with these limits may be made at closer distances, provided a sufficient number of measurements are taken to plot the radiation pattern, to determine the major lobes of radiation, and to determine the expected field strength level at 30, 300, or 1600 meters. Alternatively, if measurements are made at only one closer fixed distance, then the permissible field strength limits shall be adjusted using 1/d as an attenuation factor.
