(b) *International terrestrial and satellite Bearer Circuits.* (1) Regulatory fees for International Bearer Circuits are to be paid by facilities-based common carriers that have active (used or leased) international bearer circuits as of December 31 of the prior year in any terrestrial or satellite transmission facility for the provision of service to an end user or resale carrier, which includes active circuits to themselves or to their affiliates. In addition, non-common carrier terrestrial and satellite operators must pay a fee for each active circuit sold or leased to any customer, including themselves or their affiliates, other than an international common carrier authorized by the Commission to provide U.S. international common carrier services. “Active circuits” for purposes of this paragraph (b) include backup and redundant circuits. In addition, whether circuits are used specifically for voice or data is not relevant in determining that they are active circuits.

(2) The fee amount, per active Gbps circuit will be determined for each fiscal year.

Table 2 to Paragraph (b)(2)

|            International terrestrial and satellite (capacity as of December 31, 2021)            |Fee amount|

|Terrestrial Common Carrier and Non-Common Carrier; Satellite Common Carrier and Non-Common Carrier|$39<br/>\*|

\* Per Gbps circuit.

(c) *Submarine cable.* Regulatory fees for submarine cable systems will be paid annually, per cable landing license, for all submarine cable systems operating based on their lit capacity as of December 31 of the prior year. The fee amount will be determined by the Commission for each fiscal year.
