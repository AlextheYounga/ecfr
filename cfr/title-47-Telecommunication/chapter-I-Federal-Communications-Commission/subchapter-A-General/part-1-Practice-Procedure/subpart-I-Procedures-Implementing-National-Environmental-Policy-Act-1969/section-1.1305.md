##### § 1.1305 Actions which normally will have a significant impact upon the environment, for which Environmental Impact Statements must be prepared. #####

Any Commission action deemed to have a significant effect upon the quality of the human environment requires the preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) and Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) (collectively referred to as EISs) (*see* §§ 1.1314, 1.1315 and 1.1317). The Commission has reviewed representative actions and has found no common pattern which would enable it to specify actions that will thus automatically require EISs.

Note:

Our current application forms refer applicants to § 1.1305 to determine if their proposals are such that the submission of environmental information is required (*see* § 1.1311). Until the application forms are revised to reflect our new environmental rules, applicants should refer to § 1.1307. Section 1.1307 now delineates those actions for which applicants must submit environmental information.
