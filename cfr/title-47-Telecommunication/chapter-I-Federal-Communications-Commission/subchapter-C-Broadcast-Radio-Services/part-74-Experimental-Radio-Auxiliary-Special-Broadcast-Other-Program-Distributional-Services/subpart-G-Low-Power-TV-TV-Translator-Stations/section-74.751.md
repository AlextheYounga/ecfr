(2) Any change in the transmitting antenna system, including the direction of radiation, directive antenna pattern, antenna gain, transmission line loss characteristics, or height of antenna center of radiation.

(3) Any change in the overall height of the antenna structure, except where notice to the Federal Aviation Administration is specifically not required under § 17.14(b) of this chapter.

(4) Any horizontal change of the location of the antenna structure which would (i) be in excess of 152.4 meters (500 feet), or (ii) require notice to the Federal Aviation Administration pursuant to § 17.7 of the FCC's Rules.
