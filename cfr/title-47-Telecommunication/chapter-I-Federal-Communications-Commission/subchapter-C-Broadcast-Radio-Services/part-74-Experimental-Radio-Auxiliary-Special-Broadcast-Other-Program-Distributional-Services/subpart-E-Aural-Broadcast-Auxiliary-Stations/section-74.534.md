##### ยง 74.534 Power limitations. #####

(a) *Transmitter output power.* (1) Transmitter output power shall be limited to that necessary to accomplish the function of the system.

(2) In the 17,700 to 19,700 MHz band, transmitter output power shall not exceed 10 watts.

(b) In no event shall the average equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), as referenced to an isotropic radiator, exceed the values specified in the following table. In cases of harmful interference, the Commission may, after notice and opportunity for hearing, order a change in the equivalent isotropically radiated power of this station.

|<sup>1</sup> Stations licensed based on an application filed before April 16, 2003, for EIRP values exceeding those specified above, may continue to operate indefinitely in accordance with the terms of their current authorizations, subject to periodic renewal.|                                         |

(c) The EIRP of transmitters that use Automatic Transmitter Power Control (ATPC) shall not exceed the EIRP specified on the station authorization. The EIRP of non-ATPC transmitters shall be maintained as near as practicable to the EIRP specified on the station authorization.
