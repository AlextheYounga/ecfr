(c) For emissions on frequencies above 25 MHz with authorized bandwidths up to 30 kHz, the emissions shall comply with the emission mask and transient frequency behavior requirements of ยงยง 90.210 and 90.214 of this chapter. For all other emissions, the mean power of emissions shall be attenuated below the mean output power of the transmitter in accordance with the following schedule:

(1) On any frequency removed from the assignment frequency by more than 50 percent up to and including 100 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 25 dB:

(2) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 100 percent up to and including 250 percent of the authorized bandwidth: at least 35 dB;

(3) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 250 percent on the authorized bandwidth; at least 43 plus 10 log10 (mean output power, in watts) dB.

(d) In the event a station's emissions outside its authorized channel cause harmful interference, the Commission may, at its discretion, require the licensee to take such further steps as may be necessary to eliminate the interference.

Note:

The measurements of emission power can be expressed in peak or mean values provided they are expressed in the same parameters as the unmodulated transmitter carrier power.
