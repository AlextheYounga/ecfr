##### § 74.736 Emissions and bandwidth. #####

(a) The license of a low power TV, TV translator, or TV booster station authorizes the transmission of the visual signal by amplitude modulation (A5) and the accompanying aural signal by frequency modulation (F3).

(b) Standard width television channels will be assigned and the transmitting apparatus shall be operated so as to limit spurious emissions to the lowest practicable value. Any emissions including intermodulation products and radio frequency harmonics which are not essential for the transmission of the desired picture and sound information shall be considered to be spurious emissions.

(c) Any emissions appearing on frequencies more than 3 MHz above or below the upper and lower edges, respectively, of the assigned channel shall be attenuated no less than:

(1) 30 dB for transmitters rated at no more than 1 watt power output.

(2) 50 dB for transmitters rated at more than 1 watt power output.

(3) 60 dB for transmitters rated at more than 100 watts power output.

(d) Greater attenuation than that specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be required if interference results from emissions outside the assigned channel.
