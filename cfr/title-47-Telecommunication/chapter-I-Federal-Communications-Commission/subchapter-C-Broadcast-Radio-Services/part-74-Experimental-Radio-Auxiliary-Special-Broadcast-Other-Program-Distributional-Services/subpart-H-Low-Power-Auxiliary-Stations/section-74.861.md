##### § 74.861 Technical requirements. #####

(a) Except as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, transmitter power is the power at the transmitter output terminals and delivered to the antenna, antenna transmission line, or any other impedance-matched, radio frequency load. For the purpose of this subpart, the transmitter power is the carrier power.

(b) Each authorization for a new low power auxiliary station shall require the use of certificated equipment. Such equipment shall be operated in accordance with the emission specifications included in the certification grant and as prescribed in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section.

(c) Low power auxiliary transmitters not required to operate on specific carrier frequencies shall operate sufficiently within the authorized frequency band edges to insure the emission bandwidth falls entirely within the authorized band.

(d) For low power auxiliary stations operating in the bands other than those allocated for TV broadcasting, the following technical requirements are imposed.

Beyond one megahertz below and above the carrier frequency, emissions shall comply with the limits specified in section 8.4 of ETSI EN 300 422-1 v1.4.2 (2011-08).

(iii) In the 6875-6900 MHz and 7100-7125 MHz bands, digital emissions within the band from one megahertz below to one megahertz above the carrier frequency shall comply with the emission mask in section 8.3.2.2 (Figure 5) of the European Telecommunications Institute Standard ETSI EN 300 422-1 v1.4.2 (2011-08), Electromagnetic compatibility and Radio spectrum Matters (ERM); Wireless microphones in the 25 MHz to 3 GHz frequency range; part 1: Technical characteristics and methods of measurement. Beyond one megahertz below and above the carrier frequency, emissions shall comply with the limits specified in section 8.4 of ETSI EN 300 422-1 v1.4.2 (2011-08).

(iv) For the 944-952 MHz band, the requirements of this paragraph (d)(4) shall not apply to the applications for certification of equipment for that band until nine months after release of the Commission's Channel Reassignment Public Notice, as defined in section 73.3700(a)(2) of this chapter.

(e) For low power auxiliary stations operating in the 600 MHz duplex gap and the bands allocated for TV broadcasting, the following technical requirements apply:

(1) The power may not exceed the following values.
