##### ยง 73.31 Rounding of nominal power specified on applications. #####

(a) An application filed with the FCC for a new station or for an increase in power of an existing station shall specify nominal power rounded to two significant figures as follows:

|Nominal power (kW)|Rounded down to nearest figure (kW)|
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
|    Below 0.25    |               0.001               |
|   0.25 to 0.99   |               0.01                |
|     1 to 9.9     |                0.1                |
|     10 to 50     |                 1                 |

(b) In rounding the nominal power in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section the RMS shall be adjusted accordingly. If rounding upward to the nearest figure would result in objectionable interference, the nominal power specified on the application is to be rounded downward to the next nearest figure and the RMS adjusted accordingly.
