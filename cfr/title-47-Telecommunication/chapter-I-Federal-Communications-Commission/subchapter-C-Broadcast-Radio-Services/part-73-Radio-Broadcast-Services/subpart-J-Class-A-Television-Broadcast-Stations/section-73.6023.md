##### § 73.6023 Distributed transmission systems. #####

(a) Station licensees may operate a commonly owned group of Class A stations with contiguous predicted TV noise-limited contours (pursuant to § 73.619(c)) on a common television channel in a distributed transmission system.

(b) A Class A TV station may be authorized to operate multiple synchronized transmitters on its assigned channel to provide service consistent with the requirements of this section. Such operation is called a distributed transmission system (DTS). Except as expressly provided in this section, Class A stations operating a DTS facility must comply with all rules in this part applicable to Class A single-transmitter stations.

(c) For purposes of compliance with this section, a Class A station's “authorized facility” is the facility authorized for the station in a license or construction permit for non-DTS, single-transmitter-location operation. A Class A station's “authorized service area” is defined as the area within its protected contour (described by § 73.6010(c)) as determined using the authorized facility.
