An application for digital operation of an existing Class A TV station or to change the facilities of a digital Class A TV station will not be accepted if it fails to protect authorized Class A and digital Class A stations in accordance with the requirements of § 74.793 (b) through (d) and § 74.793(g) of this chapter. This protection must be afforded to applications for changes in other authorized Class A and digital Class A stations filed prior to the date the digital Class A application is filed.
