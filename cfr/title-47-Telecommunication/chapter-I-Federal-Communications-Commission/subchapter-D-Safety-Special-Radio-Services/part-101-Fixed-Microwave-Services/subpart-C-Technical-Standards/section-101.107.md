Tolerance for 2450-2500 MHz is 0.005%. Beginning Aug. 9, 1975, this tolerance will govern the marketing of LTTS equipment and the issuance of all such authorizations for new radio equipment. Until that date new equipment may be authorized with a frequency tolerance of .03% in the frequency range 2,200 to 10,500 MHz and .05% in the range 10,500 MHz to 12,200 MHz, and equipment so authorized may continue to be used for its life provided that it does not cause interference to the operation of any other licensee. Beginning March 1, 2005, new LTTS operators will not be licensed and existing LTTS licensees will not be renewed in the 11.7-12.2 GHz band.                                                                                                                          |                             |

|<sup>7</sup> The frequency tolerance for stations authorized on or before April 1, 2005 is 0.03%. Existing licensees and pending applicants on that date may continue to operate after that date with a frequency tolerance of 0.03%, provided that it does not cause harmful interference to the operation of any other licensee. For analog systems, if the channel bandwidth is greater than 30 MHz up to 50 MHz, the frequency tolerance standard will be 0.03%; if the channel bandwidth is 30 MHz or less, then the frequency tolerance standard will be 0.003%. This analog standard is conditional provided that harmful interference is not caused to digital stations operating within the 0.001% tolerance standards. If harmful interference is caused to stations operating with the more stringent standard, the onus shall be on the operators with the less stringent parameters to develop an engineering solution to the problem.

(b) Heterodyne microwave radio systems may be authorized at a somewhat less restrictive frequency tolerance (up to .01 percent) to compensate for frequency shift caused by numerous repeaters between base band signal insertion. Where such relaxation is sought, applicant must provide all calculations and indicate the desired tolerance over each path. In such instances the radio transmitters and receivers used must individually be capable of complying with the tolerance specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Heterodyne operation is restricted to channel bandwidth of 10 MHz or greater.

(c) As an additional requirement in any band where the Commission makes assignments according to a specified channel plan, provisions must be made to prevent the emission included within the occupied bandwidth from radiating outside the assigned channel at a level greater than that specified in ยง 101.111.
