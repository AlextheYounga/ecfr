##### § 101.109 Bandwidth. #####

(a) Each authorization issued pursuant to these rules will show, as the emission designator, a symbol representing the class of emission which must be prefixed by a number specifying the necessary bandwidth. This figure does not necessarily indicate the bandwidth actually occupied by the emission at any instant. In those cases where part 2 of this chapter does not provide a formula for the computation of the necessary bandwidth, the occupied bandwidth may be used in the emission designator.

(b) Stations in this service will be authorized any type of emission, method of modulation, and transmission characteristic, consistent with efficient use of the spectrum and good engineering practice, except that Type B, damped-wave emission will not be authorized.

(c) The maximum bandwidth which will be authorized per frequency assigned is set out in the table that follows. Regardless of the maximum authorized bandwidth specified for each frequency band, the Commission reserves the right to issue a license for less than the maximum bandwidth if it appears that a lesser bandwidth would be sufficient to support an applicant's intended communications.

<sup>1</sup> The maximum bandwidth that will be authorized for each particular frequency in this band is detailed in the appropriate frequency table in § 101.147. If contiguous channels are aggregated in the 928-928.85/952-952.85/956.25-956.45 MHz, the 928.85-929/959.85-960 MHz, or the 932-932.5/941-941.5 MHz bands, then the bandwidth may exceed that which is listed in the table.

<sup>2</sup> 1250 KHz, 1875 KHz, or 2500 KHz on a case-by-case basis.

<sup>3</sup> To be specified in authorization. For the band 92 to 95 GHz, maximum bandwidth is licensed in one segment of 2 GHz from 92-94 GHz and one 0.9 GHz segment from 94.1 to 95 GHz, or the total of the loaded band if smaller than the assigned bandwidth.

<sup>4</sup> For exceptions, see § 101.147(s).

<sup>5</sup> A 12.5 kHz bandwidth applies only to frequencies listed in § 101.147(b)(1) through (4).

<sup>6</sup> For frequencies listed in § 101.147(b)(1) through (4), consideration will be given on a case-by-case basis to authorizing bandwidths up to 50 kHz.

<sup>7</sup> For channel block assignments in the 24,250-25,250 MHz band, the authorized bandwidth is equivalent to an unpaired channel block assignment or to either half of a symmetrical paired channel block assignment. When adjacent channels are aggregated, equipment is permitted to operate over the full channel block aggregation without restriction.

Note to footnote 7: Unwanted emissions shall be suppressed at the aggregate channel block edges based on the same roll-off rate as is specified for a single channel block in § 101.111(a)(1) or in § 101.111(a)(2)(ii) and (iii) as appropriate.

<sup>8</sup> For incumbent private operational fixed point-to-point stations in this band (those not licensed as MVDDS), the maximum bandwidth shall be 20 MHz.
