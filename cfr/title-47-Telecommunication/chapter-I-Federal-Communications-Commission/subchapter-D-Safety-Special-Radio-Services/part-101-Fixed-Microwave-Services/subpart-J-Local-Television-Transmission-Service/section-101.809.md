##### ยง 101.809 Bandwidth and emission limitations. #####

(a) Stations in this service operating on frequencies in the 27.23-27.28 MHz band will be authorized to employ only amplitude modulated or frequency modulated emission for radiotelephony. The authorization to use such emissions will be construed to include authority to employ unmodulated emission only for temporary or short periods necessary for equipment testing incident to the construction and maintenance of the station.

(b) Stations in the service operating on frequencies above 940 MHz may be authorized to use amplitude modulated, frequency modulated or pulse type of emission for radiotelephony and television. In addition, the use of unmodulated emission may be authorized in appropriate cases.

(c) The maximum bandwidths which will normally be authorized for single channel operation on frequencies below 500 MHz in this service must not exceed the limits set forth below:

|Type of emission|Authorized bandwidth (kHz)|
|----------------|--------------------------|
|      A3E       |            8             |
|  F3E or (G3E)  |            40            |

(d) Maximum bandwidths in the following frequency bands must not exceed the limits set forth below:
