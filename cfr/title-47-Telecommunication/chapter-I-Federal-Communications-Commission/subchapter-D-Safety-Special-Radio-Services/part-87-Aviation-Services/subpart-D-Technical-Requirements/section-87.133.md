(c) For single-sideband transmitters, the tolerance is:

(2) All aircraft stationsโ20 Hz.

(d) For radar transmitters, except non-pulse signal radio altimeters, the frequency at which maximum emission occurs must be within the authorized frequency band and must not be closer than 1.5/T MHz to the upper and lower limits of the authorized bandwidth, where T is the pulse duration in microseconds.

(e) The Commission may authorize tolerances other than those specified in this section upon a satisfactory showing of need.

(g) Any aeronautical enroute service transmitter operating in U.S. controlled airspace with 8.33 kHz channel spacing (except equipment being tested by avionics equipment manufacturers and flight test stations prior to delivery to their customers for use outside U.S. controlled airspace) must achieve 0.0005% frequency stability when operating in that mode.
