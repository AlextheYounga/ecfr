##### ยง 87.303 Frequencies. #####

(a) These frequencies are available for assignment to flight test land and aircraft stations:

|       kHz        |        MHz        |        MHz        |        MHz        |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|3281.0<sup>1</sup>|123.175<sup>2</sup>|123.225<sup>3</sup>|123.400<sup>2</sup>|
|                  |123.200<sup>3</sup>|123.375<sup>3</sup>|123.450<sup>3</sup>|

(b) These additional frequencies are available for assignment only to flight test stations of aircraft manufacturers:

|        MHz        |        MHz        |        MHz        |        MHz        |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
|123.125<sup>2</sup>|123.275<sup>3</sup>|123.425<sup>3</sup>|123.550<sup>3</sup>|
|123.150<sup>2</sup>|123.325<sup>3</sup>|123.475<sup>3</sup>|123.575<sup>2</sup>|
|123.250<sup>3</sup>|123.350<sup>3</sup>|123.525<sup>3</sup>|                   |

<sup>1</sup> When R3E, H3E or J3E emission is used, the assigned frequency will be 3282.4 kHz (3281.0 kHz carrier frequency).

<sup>2</sup> This frequency is available only to itinerant stations that have a requirement to be periodically transferred to various locations.

<sup>3</sup> Mobile station operations on these frequencies are limited to an area within 320 km (200 mi) of an associated flight test land station.

(c) These frequencies are available for equipment test, emergency and backup use with aircraft beyond the range of VHF propagation. Either H2B, J3E, J7B or J9W emission may be used.

(d) Aeronautical mobile telemetry (AMT) operations are conducted in the 1435-1525 MHz, 2345-2395 MHz, and 5091-5150 MHz bands on a co-equal basis with U.S. Government stations.

(1) Frequencies in the band 1435-1525 MHz are also available for low power auxiliary station use on a secondary basis.

(2) Frequencies in the 5091-5150 MHz band are assigned in the aeronautical mobile service on a primary basis for flight testing of aircraft. AMT use of these frequencies is restricted to aircraft stations transmitting to aeronautical stations (AMT ground stations) in the flight test areas listed in 47 CFR 2.106, footnote US111.

(3) The authorized bandwidths for stations that operate in the 1435-1525 MHz, 2345-2395 MHz, or 5091-5150 MHz bands are normally 1, 3 or 5 MHz. Applications for greater bandwidths will be considered in accordance with the provisions of ยง 87.135. Each assignment will be centered on a frequency between 1435.5 MHz and 1524.5 MHz, between 2345.5 MHz and 2394.5 MHz, or between 5091.5 MHz and 5149.5 MHz, with 1 MHz channel spacing.

(e) 121.500 MHz: Emergency and distress only.

(f) Frequency assignments for Flight Test VHF Stations may be based on either 8.33 kHz or 25 kHz spacing. Assignable frequencies include the interstitial frequencies 8.33 kHz from the VHF frequencies listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. Each 8.33 kHz interstitial frequency is subject to the same eligibility criteria and limitations as the nearest frequency listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
