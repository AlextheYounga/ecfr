##### § 88.31 Non-networked access use. #####

(a) Parties registered with a DFMS may submit a request to the DFMS for temporary frequency assignments for CNPC limited to the duration and geographic coverage necessary to support a single submitted UAS flight. Requests may also be made either prior to or during the relevant operation to modify an assignment. Such requests must be made to the same DFMS responsible for the original assignment.

(b) If frequencies meeting the request are available, the DFMS shall assign them on an exclusive but temporary basis. The scope of the assignment shall be tailored in both duration and geographic coverage to ensure interference-free communications for the entire submitted UAS flight.

(c) When registering with or using the services of a DFMS, a party shall comply with all DFMS Administrator instructions, including those regarding registration process and procedures, requests and other submissions to the DFMS, and operational use of NNA assignments.

(d) UAS operations using NNA assignments within the National Radio Quiet Zone (NRQZ) are prohibited without the prior coordination with the NRQZ administrator required under § 88.35. Consistent with § 2.106(c)(211) of this chapter, NNA users should take all practicable steps to protect radio astronomy in the 4990-5000 MHz band, subject to § 2.106(c)(74) of this chapter.

(e) Any UAS ground station using an NNA assignment to support a UAS flight, or proxy software acting on the ground station's behalf, must be capable of communicating with the assigning DFMS to achieve the following:

(1) confirm that all NNA stations used in the operation, including any UAS ground station or airborne station used in the flight, are programmed to limit communications in the 5030-5091 MHz band, during the period of the frequency assignment, to the specific frequencies assigned by the DFMS and in accordance with the other terms of the assignment; and

(2) send updates on flight status when a UA has launched and when it has landed.

Effective Date Note:At 90 FR 1395, Jan. 8, 2025, Part 88 was added, and § 88.31 was delayed indefinitely.
