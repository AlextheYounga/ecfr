##### ยง 88.5 Definitions. #####

The following terms and definitions apply only to the rules in this part.

*Control and Non-payload Communications* (*CNPC*). Any transmission that is sent between the UA component and the UAS ground station of the UAS and that supports the safety or regularity of the UA's flight.

*Dynamic Frequency Management System* (*DFMS*). A frequency coordination system operating in the 5030-5091 MHz band that:

(1) Is highly automated and capable of providing rapid responses to frequency assignment requests from registered NNA operators, and

(2) In response to such requests, is capable of assigning to the requesting operator temporary protected use of certain frequencies for a particular geographic area and time period tailored to the operator's submitted operation, to the extent such frequencies are available.

*Dynamic Frequency Management System (DFMS) Administrator.* An entity authorized by the Commission to operate a DFMS in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in subpart E of this part.

*Interim Access Mechanism* (*IAM*). A process by which non-networked access users will be allowed temporary, short-term access to 5040-5060 MHz frequencies in the period before the first DFMS is approved and placed into operation.

*Non-Networked Access* (*NNA*). Temporary, interference-protected access to the 5030-5091 MHz band consistent with subpart B of this part.

*Non-Networked Access (NNA) station.* An uncrewed aircraft system ground station or uncrewed aircraft station authorized under this part and designed to communicate using NNA assignments consistent with subparts B and D.

*Non-Networked Access (NNA) user.* An authorized user of spectrum in the 5030-5091 MHz band operating on an NNA basis, as set forth in subpart B.

*Payload.* Information that is sent to or from a UA component to achieve mission objectives and is not CNPC.

*Uncrewed Aircraft* (*UA*). An aircraft operated without the possibility of direct human intervention from within or on the aircraft.

*Uncrewed Aircraft Station.* A mobile station authorized under this part and located on board a UA.

*Uncrewed Aircraft System* (*UAS*). A UA and its associated elements (including an uncrewed aircraft station, communication links, and the components not on board the UA that control the UA) that are required for the safe and efficient operation of the UA in the airspace of the United States.

*Uncrewed Aircraft System (UAS) Ground Station.* Radio communications equipment on the ground used to maintain control over or otherwise communicate with a UA.
