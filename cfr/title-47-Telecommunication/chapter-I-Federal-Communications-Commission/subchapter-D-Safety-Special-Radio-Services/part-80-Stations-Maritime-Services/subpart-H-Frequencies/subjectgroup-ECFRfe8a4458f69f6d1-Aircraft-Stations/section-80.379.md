(b) The conditions of use of the carrier frequencies in paragraph (a) of this section, are:

(1) For permissible geographic areas of operation see ยง 80.373(b)(1). For other limitations see ยง 80.373(b)(7);

(2) Aircraft and ship stations may use 3023.0 kHz and 5680.0 kHz for search and rescue scene-of-action coordination including communications between these stations and participating land stations. Stations using these frequencies must use J3E emission;

(3) Assignable for distress and safety communications between aircraft and maritime mobile stations;

(4) Assignable for search and rescue between ships and aircraft. Stations using these frequencies must use A3E emission;

(5) These frequencies may be used by aircraft stations when:

(i) The altitude of aircraft stations does not exceed 300 meters (1,000 feet), except for reconnaissance aircraft participating in icebreaking operations where an altitude of 450 meters (1,500 feet) is allowed;

(ii) The mean power of aircraft stations must not exceed five watts;

(iii) Communications are limited to operations in which the maritime mobile stations are primarily involved and where direct communications between the aircraft and the ship or coast station is required;

(iv) Stations may use 156.300 MHz for safety purposes only;

(v) Stations may use 156.800 MHz for distress, safety and calling only; and

(vi) Use of 156.375 MHz by aircraft is not permitted in the New Orleans VTS area specified in ยง 80.383.

(6) The use of 157.100 MHz is limited to communications with stations of the Department of Interior at Lake Mead, Nevada; and

(7) Commercial fishing vessels and associated aircraft may use 157.425 MHz while engaged in commercial fishing activities except within 120 km (75 miles) of the United States/Canada border and Puget Sound and the Strait of Juan de Fuca and its approaches, the Great Lakes, and the St. Lawrence Seaway.
