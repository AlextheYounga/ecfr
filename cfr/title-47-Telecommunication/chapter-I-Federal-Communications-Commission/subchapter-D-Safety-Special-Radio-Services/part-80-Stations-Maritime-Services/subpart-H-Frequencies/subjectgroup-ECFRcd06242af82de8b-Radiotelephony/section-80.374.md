##### ยง 80.374 Provisions for frequencies in the 4000-4063 and the 8100-8195 kHz bands shared with the fixed service. #####

Coast station assignments in the 4000-4063 kHz band deviate from international provisions. Coast station assignments in the 4000-4063 kHz band are permitted provided that such stations must not cause interference to, and must accept interference from, stations operated by other countries in accordance with the Radio Regulations.

(a) *Frequencies in the 4000-4063 kHz band.* (1) The frequencies in the 4000-4063 kHz bands are available to ship and public coast stations for:

(i) Supplementary ship-to-shore duplex operations with coast stations assigned the frequencies described in ยง 80.371(b) of this part;

(ii) Intership simplex operations and cross-band operations;

(iii) Ship-to-shore or shore-to-ship simplex operations; or

(iv) Duplex operations with coast stations assigned in the band 4438-4650 kHz, as described in ยง 80.373(d) of this part.
