##### ยง 80.205 Bandwidths. #####

(a) An emission designator shows the necessary bandwidth for each class of emission of a station except that in ship earth stations it shows the occupied or necessary bandwidth, whichever is greater. The following table gives the class of emission and corresponding emission designator and authorized bandwidth:
