##### § 80.207 Classes of emission. #####

(a) Authorization to use radiotelephone and radiotelegraph emissions by ship and coast stations includes the use of digital selective calling and selective calling techniques in accordance with § 80.225.

(b) In radiotelegraphy communications employing a modulated carrier the carrier must be keyed and modulated by an audio frequency.

(c) Authorization to use single sideband emission is limited to emitting a carrier;

(1) For full carrier transmitters at a power level between 3 and 6 dB below peak envelope power;

(2) For suppressed carrier transmitters at a power level at least 40 dB below peak envelope power; and

(3) For reduced or variable level carrier:

(i) In the 1600-4000 kHz band:

(A) For coast station transmitters 18±2 dB below peak envelope power;

(B) For ship station transmitters installed before January 2, 1982, 16±2 dB below peak envelope power; and

(C) For ship station transmitters installed after January 1, 1982, 18±2 dB below peak envelope power.

(ii) In the 4000-27500 kHz band:

(A) For coast station transmitters 18±2 dB below peak envelope power;

(B) For ship station transmitters installed before January 2, 1978, 16±2 dB below peak envelope power; and

(C) For ship station transmitters installed after January 1, 1978, 18±2 dB below peak envelope power.

(d) The authorized classes of emission are as follows:
