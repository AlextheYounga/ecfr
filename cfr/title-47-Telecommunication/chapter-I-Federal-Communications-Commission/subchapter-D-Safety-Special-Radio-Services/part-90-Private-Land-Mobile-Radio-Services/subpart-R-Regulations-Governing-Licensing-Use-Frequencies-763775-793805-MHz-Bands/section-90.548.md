(a) Transmitters designed after August 11, 2014 to operate on the narrowband interoperability achannels in the 769-775 and 799-805 MHz band (*see* § 90.531) shall conform to the following technical standards (transmitters certified prior to this date are grandfathered):

(1) Transmitters designed for voice operation shall include a 12.5 kilohertz bandwidth mode of operation conforming to the following standards: ANSI/TIA-102.BAAA-A-2003 and ANSI/TIA-102.BABA-2003.

(2) Transmitters designed for data transmission shall include a 12.5 kilohertz bandwidth mode of operation conforming to the following standards: ANSI/TIA-102.BAEA-B-2012, ANSI/TIA-102.BAAA-A-2003, ANSI/TIA-102.BAEB-A-2005, and ANSI/TIA-102.BAEE-B-2010.

(2) [Reserved]

(c) Transceivers capable of operating on the interoperability channels listed in § 90.531(b)(1) shall not be marketed or sold unless the transceiver has previously been certified for interoperability by the Compliance Assessment Program (CAP) administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; provided, however, that this requirement is suspended if the CAP is discontinued. Submission of a 700 MHz narrowband radio for certification will constitute a representation by the manufacturer that the radio will be shown, by testing, to be interoperable across vendors before it is marketed or sold. In the alternative, manufacturers may employ their own protocol for verifying compliance with Project 25 standards and determining that their product is interoperable among vendors. In the event that field experience reveals that a transceiver is not interoperable, the Commission may require the manufacturer thereof to provide evidence of compliance with this section.
