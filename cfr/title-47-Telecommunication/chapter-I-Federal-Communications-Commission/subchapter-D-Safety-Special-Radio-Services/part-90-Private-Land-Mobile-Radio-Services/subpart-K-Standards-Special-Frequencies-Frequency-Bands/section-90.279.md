##### ยง 90.279 Power limitations applicable to the 421-430 MHz band. #####

(a) Base station authorizations in the 421-430 MHz band will be subject to Effective Radiated Power (ERP) and Effective Antenna Height (EAH) limitations as shown in the table below. ERP is defined as the product of the power supplied to the antenna and its gain relative to a half-wave dipole in a given direction. EAH is calculated by subtracting the Assumed Average Terrain Elevation (AATE) as listed in table 7 of ยง 90.619 from the antenna height above mean sea level.

|Effective antenna height (EAH) in meters (feet)|Maximum effective radiated power (ERP) (watts)|
