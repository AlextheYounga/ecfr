##### ยง 90.357 Frequencies for LMS systems in the 902-928 MHz band. #####

(a) Multilateration LMS systems will be authorized on the following LMS sub-bands:

|          LMS sub-band          |Forward link<sup>1</sup>|
|--------------------------------|------------------------|
|      904.000-909.750 MHz       |  927.750-928.000 MHz.  |

|LMS Sub-band<sup>1</sup>|
|------------------------|
|  902.000-904.000 MHz   |
|  909.750-921.750 MHz   |

<sup>1</sup> Applicants for non-multilateration LMS systems should request only the minimum amount of bandwidth necessary to meet their operational needs.
