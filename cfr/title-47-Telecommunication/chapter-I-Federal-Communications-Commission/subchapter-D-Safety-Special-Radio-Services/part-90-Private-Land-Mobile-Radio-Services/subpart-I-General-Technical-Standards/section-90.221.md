##### § 90.221 Adjacent channel power limits. #####

(a) For the frequency bands indicated below, operations using equipment designed to operate with a 25 kHz channel bandwidth may be authorized up to a 22 kHz bandwidth if the equipment meets the adjacent channel power (ACP) limits below. The table specifies a value for the ACP as a function of the displacement from the channel center frequency and a measurement bandwidth of 18 kHz.

(b)(1) Maximum adjacent power levels for frequencies in the 450-470 MHz band:

|Frequency offset|Maximum ACP (dBc) for devices 1 watt and less|Maximum ACP (dBc) for devices above 1 watt|
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
|     25 kHz     |                   −55 dBc                   |                 −60 dBc                  |
|     50 kHz     |                   −70 dBc                   |                 −70 dBc                  |
|     75 kHz     |                   −70 dBc                   |                 −70 dBc                  |

(2) In any case, no requirement in excess of −36 dBm shall apply.

(c)(1) Maximum adjacent power levels for frequencies in the 809-824/854-869 MHz band:

|Frequency offset|Maximum ACP (dBc) for devices less than 15 watts|Maximum ACP (dBc) for devices 15 watts and above|
|----------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
|     25 kHz     |                    −55 dBc                     |                    −55 dBc                     |
|     50 kHz     |                    −65 dBc                     |                    −65 dBc                     |
|     75 kHz     |                    −65 dBc                     |                    −70 dBc                     |

(2) In any case, no requirement in excess of −36 dBm shall apply.

(d) On any frequency removed from the assigned frequency by more than 75 kHz, the attenuation of any emission must be at least 43 + 10 log (Pwatts) dB.
