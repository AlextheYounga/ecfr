<sup>1</sup> Standard radials are 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270° and 315° to True North. The height above average terrain on any standard radial is based upon the average terrain elevation above mean sea level.

(3) Stations may be authorized on channels primary to Mexico in the Sharing Zone provided the maximum power flux density (PFD) at any point at or beyond the border does not exceed −107 db(W/m2) per 25 kHz of bandwidth. Licensees may exceed this value only if all potentially affected counterpart operators in the other country agree to a higher PFD level.

(4) Stations authorized on U.S.-Mexico co-primary channels in the Sharing Zone are permitted to exceed a maximum power flux density (PFD) of −107 db(W/m2) per 25 kHz of bandwidth at any point at or beyond the border only if all potentially affected counterpart operators of 800 MHz high density cellular systems, as defined in § 90.7, agree.

(5) Channels in the Sharing Zone are available for licensing as indicated in Table A3 to this paragraph (a)(5).

(4) All channels in the 896-901/935-940 MHz band are available for assignment to U.S. stations within the Mexico border region if the maximum power flux density (pfd) of the station's transmitted signal at any point at or beyond the border does not exceed −107 dB (W/m2). The spreading loss must be calculated using the free space formula taking into account any antenna discrimination in the direction of the border. Authorizations for stations using channels allotted to Mexico on a primary basis will be secondary to Mexican operations and conditioned to require that licensees take immediate action to eliminate any harmful interference resulting from the station's transmitted signal exceeding −107 dB (W/m2).

(c) *Use of 800 MHz Band in Canada Border Region.* All operations in the 806-824/851-869 MHz band within 140 km (87 miles) of the U.S./Canada border (“U.S./Canada border area”) shall be in accordance with international agreements between the U.S. and Canada.

(1) The U.S./Canada border area is divided into the following geographical regions (“Canada Border Regions”). U.S. primary channels are shown in the table by region. The remaining channels are primary to Canada (“Canada Primary channels”).

(2) Stations authorized on U.S. primary channels in all Canada Border Regions, except Region 5, will be subject to the Effective Radiated Power (ERP) and Effective Antenna Height (EAH) limitations listed in Table C2. The Effective Antenna Height is calculated by subtracting the Assumed Average Terrain Elevation (AATE) listed in Table C3 from the antenna height above mean sea level.

(4) Stations may be authorized on Canada Primary channels in the Canada Border Regions provided the maximum power flux density (PFD) per 25 kHz at or beyond the border does not exceed −107 dB(W/m2). Stations authorized on Canada Primary channels will be secondary to stations in Canada unless otherwise specified in an international agreement between the U.S. and Canada.

(5) Stations authorized to operate within 30 kilometers of the center city coordinates listed in Table C5 may operate according to the band plan for Canadian Border Regions 7A and 7B as indicated below.

Note: For assignments in the 896-901/935-940 MHz bands, the cities of Akron, Ohio (41°05′00″ N, 81°30′40″ W) and Youngstown, Ohio (41°05′57″ N, 80°39′02″ W) are considered outside of Region 3, and Syracuse, New York (43°03′04″ N, 76°09′14″ W) is considered outside of Region 2. These cities are defined as an area with the given center coordinates and encompassing a circle of 30 km radius.

(2) All frequency assignments made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall comply with the requirements of § 90.619(b).

(3) In Region 5, Channels 201-397 may be authorized in the United States under the following conditions:

(i) An assignment may be made if the predicted power flux density (PFD) of a proposed station's signal does not exceed −107 dBW/m2 at the border. The prediction of the PFD is calculated based upon a modified Longley-Rice point-to-point propagation model with time and location variabilities of 10 percent3 and 3-second digitized terrain date4.

3 See note 1, paragraph (c) of this section.

4 See note 2, paragraph (c) of this section.

(ii) Authorizations for Channels 201-397 in Region 5 are secondary to Canadian operations and conditioned to require that licensees take immediate action to eliminate any harmful interference resulting from the station's transmitted signal exceeding −107 dBW/m2 at or beyond the U.S./Canada border.

(4) Channel assignments for stations to be located in the geographical area in Region 1 enclosed by the United States-Canada border, the meridian 71° W and the line beginning at the intersection of 44°25′ N, 71° W, then running by great circle arc to the intersection of 45° N, 70° W, then North along meridian 70° W to the intersection of 45°45′ N, then running West along 45°45′ N to the intersection of the United States-Canada border, will be only for channels 121 through 160, inclusive, and will be limited to assignments with 11 kHz or less necessary bandwidth. Coordination with Canada will be required for these channels.

(5) Channel assignments for stations to be located in the geographical area in Region 3 enclosed by the meridian of 81° W longitude, the arc of a circle of 100 km radius centered at 42°39′30″ N latitude and 81° W longitude at the northern shore of Lake Erie and drawn clockwise from the southerly intersection with 80°30′ W longitude to intersect the United States-Canada border West of 81° W, and the United States-Canada border, will be only for channels 121 through 230, inclusive, and will be limited to assignments with 11 kHz or less necessary bandwidth. Coordination with Canada will be required for these channels. U.S. stations must protect Canadian stations operating on channels 121 through 230 within an area of 30 km radius from the center city coordinates (referenced to North American Datum 1983 (NAD83)) of London, Ontario (42°59′00.1″ N, 81°13′59.5″ W).

(6) *Additional channels available* - The channels listed in table 28 are available for assignment in Regions 1-6 if the maximum power flux density (PFD) of the station's transmitted signal does not exceed the limits specified in tables 29 and 30. The spreading loss shall be calculated using the free space formula taking into account any antenna discrimination in the direction of the border.
