(d) Unless otherwise specified, the channels listed in Tables 4A and 4B are available only to eligibles in the SMR category - which consists of Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) stations and eligible end users. 800 MHz high density cellular systems, as defined in § 90.7, are prohibited on these channels. These frequencies are available in non-border areas. The spectrum blocks listed in Table 4A are available for EA-based services (as defined by § 90.681) prior to January 21, 2005. No new EA-based services will be authorized after January 21, 2005. EA-based licensees who operate non-high-density cellular systems prior to January 21, 2005, may choose to remain on these channels in the non-high-density cellular portion of the 800 MHz band (as defined in § 90.614). These licensees may continue to operate non-high-density cellular systems and will be grandfathered indefinitely. The channels listed in Table 4B will be available for site-based licensing after January 21, 2005, in any Economic Area where no EA-based licensee is authorized for these channels.

(g) In a given NPSPAC region, channels below 471 listed in Tables 2 and 4B which are vacated by licensees relocating to channels 551-830 and which remain vacant after band reconfiguration will be available as indicated in § 90.617(g)(1 through 3). The only exception will be for the counties listed in § 90.614(c). At locations greater then 113 km (70 mi) from the center city coordinates of Atlanta, GA within the counties listed in § 90.614(c), the channels listed in Tables 2A and 4C which are vacated by licensees relocating to channels 411-830 and which remain vacant after band reconfiguration will be available as indicated in § 90.617(g)(1 through 3). At locations within 113 km (70 mi) of the center city coordinates of Atlanta, GA, the channels listed in Tables 2B and 4D which are vacated by licensees relocating to channels 411-830 and which remain vacant after band reconfiguration will be available as follows:

(1) Only to eligible applicants in the Public Safety Category until three years after the release of a public notice announcing the completion of band reconfiguration in that region;

(2) Only to eligible applicants in the Public Safety or Critical Infrastructure Industry Categories from three to five years after the release of a public notice announcing the completion of band reconfiguration in that region;

(3) Five years after the release of a public notice announcing the completion of band reconfiguration in that region, these channels revert back to their original pool categories.

(h) In a given 800 MHz NPSPAC region - except for the counties listed in § 90.614(c) - channels below 471 listed in Tables 2 and 4B which are vacated by a licensee relocating to channels 511-550 and remain vacant after band reconfiguration will be available as follows:

(1) Only to eligible applicants in the Public Safety Category until three years after the release of a public notice announcing the completion of band reconfiguration in that region;

(2) Only to eligible applicants in the Public Safety or Critical Infrastructure Industry Categories from three to five years after the release of a public notice announcing the completion of band reconfiguration in that region;

(3) Five years after the release of a public notice announcing the completion of band reconfiguration in that region, these channels revert back to their original pool categories.

(i) Special Mobilized Radio Systems licensees who operate systems, other than 800 MHz high density cellular systems, on any of the public safety channels listed in Table 1 prior to January 21, 2005, are grandfathered and may continue to operate on these channels indefinitely. These grandfathered licensees will be prohibited from operating 800 MHz high density cellular systems as defined in § 90.7. Site-based licensees who are grandfathered on any of the public safety channels listed in Table 1 may modify their license only if they obtain concurrence from a certified public safety coordinator in accordance with § 90.175(c). Grandfathered EA-based licensees, however, are exempt from any of the frequency coordination requirements of § 90.175 as long as their operations remain within the Economic Area defined by their license in accordance with the requirements of § 90.683(a).

(j) Licensees operating 800 MHz high density cellular systems on the channels listed in § 90.614(a), prior to January 21, 2005, may elect to continue operating on these channels and will be permitted to continue operating 800 MHz high density cellular systems (as defined in § 90.7) in this portion of the band. These licensees will be grandfathered indefinitely subject to the provisions of §§ 90.673, 90.674 and 90.675.

(k) Licensees may operate systems other than 800 MHz high density cellular systems (as defined in § 90.7) on Channels 511-550 at any location vacated by an EA-based SMR licensee. For operations on these channels, unacceptable interference (as defined in § 22.970 of this chapter and § 90.672) will be deemed to occur only at sites where the following median desired signals are received (rather than those specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1(i). The minimum required median desired signal, as measured at the R.F. input of the receiver, will be as follows:

(1) Mobile units (except in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands):

(i) For channels 511 to 524 - the minimum median desired signal levels specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) shall apply;

(ii) For channels 524 to 534 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from the values specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) to −70 dBm;

(iii) For channels 534 to 550 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from −70 dBm to −65 dBm.

(2) Portable units (except in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands):

(i) For channels 511 to 524 - the minimum median desired signal levels specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) shall apply;

(ii) For channels 524 to 530 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from the values specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) to −80 dBm;

(iii) For channels 530 to 534 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from −80 dBm to −70 dBm;

(iv) For channels 534 to 550 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from −70 dBm to −65 dBm.

(3) Mobile units operating in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands:

(i) For channels 511 to 530 - the minimum median desired signal levels specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) shall apply;

(ii) For channels 531 to 534 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from −80.2 dBm to −70 dBm;

(iii) For channels 534 to 550 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from −70 dBm to −65 dBm.

(4) Portable units operating in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands:

(i) For channels 511 to 530 - the minimum median desired signal levels specified in § 22.970(a)(1)(i) of this chapter and § 90.672(a)(1)(i) shall apply;

(ii) For channels 531 to 534 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from −80 dBm to −70 dBm;

(iii) For channels 534 to 550 - the minimum median desired signal level shall increase linearly from −70 dBm to −65 dBm.

(l) Applicants may begin to license interstitial pool channels (denoted with an “a” after the channel number) listed in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section only after the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau and the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau jointly release a public notice announcing the availability of those channels for licensing in a National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee region.

(m) Incumbent licensees in the 470-512 MHz band in the urban areas specified in § 90.303 of the Commission's rules are given priority access over mutually exclusive applicants for a three-year period to all interstitial channel pairs in the public safety pool or the business/industrial/land transportation pool listed above for which they are eligible, provided that any relocating T-Band incumbent must commit to surrendering an equal amount of 470-512 MHz spectrum on a channel-for-channel basis. The three-year period begins on the date these channel pairs become available for licensing in a National Public Safety Planning Advisory Committee region. Priority access applies to any applicant seeking to license a base station within 80 kilometers (50 miles) or mobile units or control stations within 128 kilometers (80 miles) of the geographic center of the urbanized areas listed in § 90.303 of the Commission's rules.
