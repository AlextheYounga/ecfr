##### § 95.221 (R/C Rule 21) How do I have my R/C transmitter serviced? #####

(a) You may adjust an antenna to your R/C transmitter and you may make radio checks. (A radio check means a one-way transmission for a short time in order to test the transmitter.)

(b) You are responsible for the proper operation of the station at all times and are expected to provide for observations, servicing and maintenance as often as may be necessary to ensure proper operation. Each internal repair and each internal adjustment to an FCC certificated R/C transmitter (see R/C Rule 9) must be made in accord with the Technical Regulations (see subpart E). The internal repairs or internal adjustments should be performed by or under the immediate supervision and responsibility of a person certified as technically qualified to perform transmitter maintenance and repair duties in the private land mobile services and fixed services by an organization or committee representative of users in those services.

(c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each internal repair and each internal adjustment of an R/C transmitter in which signals are transmitted must be made using a nonradiating (“dummy”) antenna.

(d) Brief test signals (signals not longer than one minute during any five minute period) using a radiating antenna may be transmitted in order to:

(1) Adjust a transmitter to an antenna;

(2) Detect or measure radiation of energy other than the intended signal; or

(3) Tune a receiver to your R/C transmitter.
