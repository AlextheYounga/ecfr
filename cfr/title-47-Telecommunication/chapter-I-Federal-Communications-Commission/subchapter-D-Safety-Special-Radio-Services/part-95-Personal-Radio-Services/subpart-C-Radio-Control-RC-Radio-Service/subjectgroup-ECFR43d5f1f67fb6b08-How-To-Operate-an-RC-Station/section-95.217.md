##### § 95.217 (R/C Rule 17) May I operate my R/C station transmitter by remote control? #####

(a) You may not operate an R/C transmitter by radio remote control. (See R/C Rule 12, § 95.212.)

(b) You may operate an R/C transmitter by wireline remote control if you obtain specific approval in writing from the FCC. To obtain FCC approval, you must show why you need to operate your station by wireline remote control. If you receive FCC approval, you must keep the approval as part of your station records. *See* R/C Rule 24, § 95.224.

(c) Remote control means operation of an R/C transmitter from any place other than the location of the R/C transmitter. Direct mechanical control or direct electrical control by wire from some point on the same premises, craft or vehicles as the R/C transmitter is not considered remote control.
