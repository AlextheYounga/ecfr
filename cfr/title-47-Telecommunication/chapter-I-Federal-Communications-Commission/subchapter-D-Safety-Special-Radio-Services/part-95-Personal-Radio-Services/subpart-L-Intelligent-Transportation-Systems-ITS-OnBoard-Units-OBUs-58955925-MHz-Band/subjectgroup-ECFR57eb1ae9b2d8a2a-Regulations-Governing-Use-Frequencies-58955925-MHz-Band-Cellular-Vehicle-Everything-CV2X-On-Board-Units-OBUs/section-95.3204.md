##### § 95.3204 OBU transmit power limit. #####

(a) The following power limits apply for OBUs without a geofencing capability at all locations and for OBUs with a geofencing capability when operating within any coordination zone specified in § 90.387(b) of this chapter:

(1) 10 MHz channel (5895-5905 MHz): 23 dBm/10 MHz EIRP;

(2) 10 MHz channel (5905-5915 MHz): 33 dBm/10 MHz EIRP, reduced to 27 dBm within ±5 degrees of horizontal;

(3) 10 MHz channel (5915-5925 MHz): 33 dBm/10 MHz EIRP, reduced to 27 dBm within ±5 degrees of horizontal;

(4) 20 MHz channel (5895-5915 MHz): 23 dBm/20 MHz EIRP;

(5) 20 MHz channel (5905-5925 MHz): 33 dBm/20 MHz EIRP, reduced to 27 dBm within ±5 degrees of horizontal; and

(6) 30 MHz channel: 23 dBm/30 MHz EIRP.

(b) The following power limits apply to OBUs with a geofencing capability when operating at locations outside any coordination zone specified in § 90.387(b) of this chapter:

(1) 10 MHz channel (5895-5905 MHz): 33 dBm/10 MHz EIRP;

(2) 10 MHz channel (5905-5915 MHz): 33 dBm/10 MHz EIRP;

(3) 10 MHz channel (5915-5925 MHz): 33 dBm/10 MHz EIRP;

(4) 20 MHz channel (5895-5915 MHz): 33 dBm/20 MHz EIRP;

(5) 20 MHz channel (5905-5925 MHz): 33 dBm/20 MHz EIRP; and

(6) 30 MHz channel: 33 dBm/30 MHz EIRP.

(c) For purposes of this section, the EIRP is root mean squared (RMS) measured as the maximum EIRP toward the horizon or horizontal, whichever is greater, of the gain associated with the main or center of the transmission beam.

(d) For purposes of this section, a portable unit is a transmitting device designed to be used so that the radiating structure(s) of the device is/are within 20 centimeters of the body of the user.
