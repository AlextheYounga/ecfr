(a)(1) MedRadio programmer/control transmitters operating in the 401-406 MHz band shall be labeled as provided in part 2 of this chapter and shall bear the following statement in a conspicuous location on the device:

“This device may not interfere with stations operating in the 400.150-406.000 MHz band in the Meteorological Aids, Meteorological Satellite, and Earth Exploration Satellite Services and must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.”

The statement may be placed in the instruction manual for the transmitter where it is not feasible to place the statement on the device.

(2) MedRadio programmer/control transmitters operating in the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, and 451-457 MHz bands shall be labeled as provided in part 2 of this chapter and shall bear the following statement in a conspicuous location on the device:

“This device may not interfere with stations authorized to operate on a primary basis in the 413-419 MHz, 426-432 MHz, 438-444 MHz, and 451-457 MHz bands, and must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.”

The statement may be placed in the instruction manual for the transmitter where it is not feasible to place the statement on the device.

(3) MedRadio programmer/control transmitters operating in the 2360-2400 MHz band shall be labeled as provided in part 2 of this chapter and shall bear the following statement in a conspicuous location on the device:

“This device may not interfere with stations authorized to operate on a primary basis in the 2360-2400 MHz band, and must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.”

The statement may be placed in the instruction manual for the transmitter where it is not feasible to place the statement on the device.

(b) Where a MedRadio programmer/control transmitter is constructed in two or more sections connected by wire and marketed together, the statement specified in this section is required to be affixed only to the main control unit.

(c) MedRadio transmitters shall be identified with a serial number, except that in the 2360-2400 MHz band only the MedRadio programmer/controller transmitter shall be identified with a serial number. The FCC ID number associated with a medical implant transmitter and the information required by § 2.925 of this chapter may be placed in the instruction manual for the transmitter and on the shipping container for the transmitter, in lieu of being placed directly on the transmitter.
