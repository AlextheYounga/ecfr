##### § 22.531 Channels for paging operation. #####

The following channels are allocated for assignment to base transmitters that provide paging service, either individually or collectively under a paging geographic area authorization. Unless otherwise indicated, all channels have a bandwidth of 20 kHz and are designated by their center frequencies in MegaHertz.
