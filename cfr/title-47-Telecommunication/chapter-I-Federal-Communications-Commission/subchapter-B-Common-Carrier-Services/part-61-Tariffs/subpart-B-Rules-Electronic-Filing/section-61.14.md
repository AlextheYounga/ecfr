##### § 61.14 Method of filing publications. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 2557, Jan. 18, 2018.

(a) Publications filed electronically must be addressed to “Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554.” The Electronic Tariff Filing System will accept filings 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The official filing date of a publication received by the Electronic Tariff Filing System will be determined by the date and time the transmission ends. If the transmission ends after the close of a business day, as that term is defined in § 1.4(e)(2) of this Chapter, the filing will be date and time stamped as of the opening of the next business day.

(b) In addition, except for issuing carriers filing tariffing fees electronically, for all tariff publications requiring fees as set forth in part 1, subpart G of this chapter, issuing carriers must submit the original of the cover letter (without attachments), FCC Form 159, and the appropriate fee to the address set forth in § 1.1105 of this chapter.

(c) Carriers that are required to file publications electronically may not file those publications on paper or other media unless specifically required to do so by the Commission.

(d) Carriers that are required to file publications electronically need only transmit one set of files to the Commission. No other copies to any other party are required.

(e) Carriers that are required to file publications electronically must comply with the format requirements set forth in §§ 61.52 and 61.54, with the exception of the informational tariffs filed pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 226(h)(1)(A).
