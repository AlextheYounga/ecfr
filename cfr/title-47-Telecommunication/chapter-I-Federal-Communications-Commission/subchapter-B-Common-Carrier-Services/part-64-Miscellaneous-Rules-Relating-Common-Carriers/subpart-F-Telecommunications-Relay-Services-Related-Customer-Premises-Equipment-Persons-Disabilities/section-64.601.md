(a) For purposes of this subpart, the terms *Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), statewide default answering point,* and *appropriate local emergency authority* are defined in 47 CFR 64.3000; the terms *pseudo-ANI* and *Wireline E911 Network* are defined in 47 CFR 9.3; the term *affiliate* is defined in 47 CFR 52.12(a)(1)(i), and the terms *majority* and *debt* are defined in 47 CFR 52.12(a)(1)(ii).

(1) *711.* The abbreviated dialing code for accessing relay services anywhere in the United States.

(2) *ACD platform.* The hardware and/or software that comprise the essential call center function of call distribution, and that are a necessary core component of Internet-based TRS.

(3) *American Sign Language (ASL).* A visual language based on hand shape, position, movement, and orientation of the hands in relation to each other and the body.

(4) *ANI.* For 911 systems, the Automatic Number Identification (ANI) identifies the calling party and may be used as the callback number.

(6) *Authorized provider.* An iTRS provider that becomes the iTRS user's new default provider, having obtained the user's authorization verified in accordance with the procedures specified in this part.

(7) *Baudot.* A seven bit code, only five of which are information bits. Baudot is used by some text telephones to communicate with each other at a 45.5 baud rate.

(8) *Call release.* A TRS feature that allows the CA to sign-off or be “released” from the telephone line after the CA has set up a telephone call between the originating TTY caller and a called TTY party, such as when a TTY user must go through a TRS facility to contact another TTY user because the called TTY party can only be reached through a voice-only interface, such as a switchboard.

(9) *Common carrier or carrier.* Any common carrier engaged in interstate Communication by wire or radio as defined in section 3(h) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Act), and any common carrier engaged in intrastate communication by wire or radio, notwithstanding sections 2(b) and 221(b) of the Act.

(10) *Communications assistant (CA).* A person who transliterates or interprets conversation between two or more end users of TRS. CA supersedes the term “TDD operator.”

The CA does not type any conversation. Two-line HCO is an HCO service that allows TRS users to use one telephone line for hearing and the other for sending TTY messages. HCO-to-TTY allows a relay conversation to take place between an HCO user and a TTY user. HCO-to-HCO allows a relay conversation to take place between two HCO users.

The functions provided by the Neutral Video Communication Service Platform include the provision of a video link, user registration and validation, authentication, authorization, ACD platform functions, routing (including emergency call routing), call setup, mapping, call features (such as call forwarding and video mail), and such other features and functions not provided by the VRS CA service provider.

(21) *New default provider.* An iTRS provider that, either directly or through its numbering partner, initiates or implements the process to become the iTRS user's default provider by replacing the iTRS user's original default provider.

(31) *Speed dialing.* A TRS feature that allows a TRS user to place a call using a stored number maintained by the TRS facility. In the context of TRS, speed dialing allows a TRS user to give the CA a short-hand” name or number for the user's most frequently called telephone numbers.

(32) *Telecommunications relay services (TRS).* Telephone transmission services that provide the ability for an individual who has a hearing or speech disability to engage in communication by wire or radio with a hearing individual in a manner that is functionally equivalent to the ability of an individual who does not have a hearing or speech disability to communicate using voice communication services by wire or radio. Such term includes services that enable two-way communication between an individual who uses a text telephone or other nonvoice terminal device and an individual who does not use such a device, speech-to-speech services, video relay services and non-English relay services. TRS supersedes the terms “dual party relay system,” “message relay services,” and “TDD Relay.”

(iv) Allowing VRS providers to indicate that a VRS user has used the service; and

(v) Maintaining the confidentiality of proprietary data housed in the database by protecting it from theft, loss or disclosure to unauthorized persons. The purpose of this database is to ensure accurate registration and verification of VRS users and improve the efficiency of the TRS program.

(38) *Unauthorized provider.* An iTRS provider that becomes the iTRS user's new default provider without having obtained the user's authorization verified in accordance with the procedures specified in this part.

(39) *Unauthorized change.* A change in an iTRS user's selection of a default provider that was made without authorization verified in accordance with the verification procedures specified in this part.
