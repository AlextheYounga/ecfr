(a) *TRS User Registration Database.* (1) VRS providers shall validate the eligibility of the party on the video side of each call by querying the TRS User Registration Database on a per-call basis. Emergency 911 calls are excepted from this requirement.

(i) Validation shall occur during the call setup process, prior to the placement of the call.

(iii) Calls that VRS providers are prohibited from completing because the user's eligibility cannot be validated shall not be included in speed of answer calculations and shall not be eligible for compensation from the TRS Fund.

(2) The administrator of the TRS User Registration Database shall assign a unique identifier to each user in the TRS User Registration Database.

(ii) The administrator of the TRS User Registration Database shall remove the data of:

(A) Any user that has neither placed nor received a VRS or point to point call in a one year period; and

(B) Any user for which a VRS provider makes a request under paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.

(4) VRS providers may query the TRS User Registration Database only for the purposes provided in this subpart, and to determine whether information with respect to its registered users already in the database is correct and complete.

(5) *User verification.* (i) The TRS User Registration Database shall have the capability of performing an identification verification check when a VRS provider or other party submits a query to the database about an existing or potential user.

(ii) VRS providers shall not register individuals that do not pass the identification verification check conducted through the TRS User Registration Database.

(2) *Compensation.* The TRS Fund, as defined by § 64.604(a)(5)(iii) of this subpart, may be used to compensate the administrator of the TRS User Registration Database for the reasonable costs of administration pursuant to the terms of its contract.
