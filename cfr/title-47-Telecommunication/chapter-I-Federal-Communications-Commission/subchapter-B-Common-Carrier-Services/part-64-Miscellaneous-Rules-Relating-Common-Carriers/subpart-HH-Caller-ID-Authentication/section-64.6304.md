(2) For purposes of this paragraph (a), “small voice service provider” means a provider that has 100,000 or fewer voice service subscriber lines (counting the total of all business and residential fixed subscriber lines and mobile phones and aggregated over all of the provider's affiliates).

(b) *Voice service providers that cannot obtain a SPC token.* Voice service providers that are incapable of obtaining a SPC token due to Governance Authority policy are exempt from the requirements of § 64.6301 until they are capable of obtaining a SPC token.

(c) *Services scheduled for section 214 discontinuance.* Services which are subject to a pending application for permanent discontinuance of service filed as of June 30, 2021, pursuant to the processes established in 47 CFR 63.60 through 63.100, as applicable, are exempt from the requirements of § 64.6301 through June 30, 2022.
