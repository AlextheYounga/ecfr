(2) For purposes of this paragraph (a), “small voice service provider” means a provider that has 100,000 or fewer voice service subscriber lines (counting the total of all business and residential fixed subscriber lines and mobile phones and aggregated over all of the provider's affiliates).

(b) *Voice service providers that cannot obtain a SPC token.* Voice service providers that are incapable of obtaining a SPC token due to Governance Authority policy are exempt from the requirements of § 64.6301 until they are capable of obtaining a SPC token.

(c) *Services scheduled for section 214 discontinuance.* Services which are subject to a pending application for permanent discontinuance of service filed as of June 30, 2021, pursuant to the processes established in 47 CFR 63.60 through 63.100, as applicable, are exempt from the requirements of § 64.6301 through June 30, 2022.

(d) *Non-IP networks.* Those portions of a voice service provider's network that rely on technology that cannot initiate, maintain, and terminate SIP calls are deemed subject to a continuing extension.

(e) *Provider-specific extensions.* The Wireline Competition Bureau may extend the deadline for compliance with § 64.6301 for voice service providers that file individual petitions for extensions by November 20, 2020. The Bureau shall seek comment on any such petitions and issue an order determining whether to grant the voice service provider an extension no later than March 30, 2021.

(f) *Annual reevaluation of granted extensions.* The Wireline Competition Bureau shall, in conjunction with an assessment of burdens and barriers to implementation of caller identification authentication technology, annually review the scope of all previously granted extensions and, after issuing a Public Notice seeking comment, may extend or decline to extend each such extension, and may decrease the scope of entities subject to a further extension.
