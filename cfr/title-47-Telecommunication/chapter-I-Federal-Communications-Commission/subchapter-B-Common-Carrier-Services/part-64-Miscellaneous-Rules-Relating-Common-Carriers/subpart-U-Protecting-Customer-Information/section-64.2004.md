Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, a telecommunications carrier may not use, disclose, or permit access to customer proprietary information except with the opt-out or opt-in approval of a customer as described in this section.

(a) *Limitations and exceptions.* A telecommunications carrier may use, disclose, or permit access to customer proprietary information without customer approval for the following purposes:

(1) In its provision of the telecommunications service from which such information is derived, or in its provision of services necessary to, or used in, the provision of such service.

(2) To initiate, render, bill, and collect for telecommunications service.

(3) To protect the rights or property of the telecommunications carrier, or to protect users of the telecommunications service and other providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of the service.

(4) To provide any inbound marketing, referral, or administrative services to the customer for the duration of a real-time interaction, if such interaction was initiated by the customer.

(5) To provide location information and/or non-sensitive customer proprietary information to:

(i) A public safety answering point, emergency medical service provider or emergency dispatch provider, public safety, fire service, or law enforcement official, or hospital emergency or trauma care facility, in order to respond to the user's request for emergency services;

(ii) Inform the user's legal guardian or members of the user's immediate family of the user's location in an emergency situation that involves the risk of death or serious physical harm; or

(iii) Providers of information or database management services solely for purposes of assisting in the delivery of emergency services in response to an emergency.

(6) As otherwise required or authorized by law.

(b) *Opt-out approval required.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, a telecommunications carrier must obtain opt-out approval from a customer to use, disclose, or permit access to any of the customer's non-sensitive customer proprietary information. If it so chooses, a telecommunications carrier may instead obtain opt-in approval from a customer to use, disclose, or permit access to any of the customer's non-sensitive customer proprietary information.

(c) *Opt-in approval required.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, a telecommunications carrier must obtain opt-in approval from a customer to:

(1) Use, disclose, or permit access to any of the customer's sensitive customer proprietary information; or

(2) Make any material retroactive change - *i.e.,* a material change that would result in a use, disclosure, or permission of access to any of the customer's proprietary information previously collected by the carrier for which the customer did not previously grant approval, either through opt-in or opt-out consent, as required by paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.

(d) *Notice and solicitation required.* (1) Except as described in paragraph (a) of this section, a telecommunications carrier must at a minimum solicit customer approval pursuant to paragraph (b) and/or (c), as applicable, at the point of sale and when making one or more material changes to privacy policies. Such solicitation may be part of, or the same communication as, a notice required by ยง 64.2003.

(2) A telecommunications carrier's solicitation of customer approval must be clear and conspicuous, and in language that is comprehensible and not misleading. Such solicitation must disclose:

(i) The types of customer proprietary information for which the carrier is seeking customer approval to use, disclose, or permit access to;

(ii) The purposes for which such customer proprietary information will be used;

(iii) The categories of entities to which the carrier intends to disclose or permit access to such customer proprietary information; and

(iv) A means to easily access the notice required by ยง 64.2003(a) and a means to access the mechanism required by paragraph (e) of this section.

(3) A telecommunications carrier's solicitation of customer approval must be completely translated into a language other than English if the telecommunications carrier transacts business with the customer in that language.

(e) *Mechanism for exercising customer approval.* A telecommunications carrier must make available a simple, easy-to-use mechanism for customers to grant, deny, or withdraw opt-in approval and/or opt-out approval at any time. Such mechanism must be clear and conspicuous, in language that is comprehensible and not misleading, and made available at no additional cost to the customer. Such mechanism must be persistently available on or through the carrier's Web site; the carrier's application (app), if it provides one for account management purposes; and any functional equivalent to the carrier's homepage or app. If a carrier does not have a Web site, it must provide a persistently available mechanism by another means such as a toll-free telephone number. The customer's grant, denial, or withdrawal of approval must be given effect promptly and remain in effect until the customer revokes or limits such grant, denial, or withdrawal of approval.
