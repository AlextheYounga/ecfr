##### ยง 64.2006 Data breach notification. #####

(a) *Customer notification.* A telecommunications carrier shall notify affected customers of any breach without unreasonable delay and in any event no later than 30 calendar days after the carrier reasonably determines that a breach has occurred, subject to law enforcement needs, unless the telecommunications carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach.

(1) A telecommunications carrier required to provide notification to a customer under this paragraph must provide such notice by one or more of the following methods:

(i) Written notification sent to either the customer's email address or the postal address on record of the customer, or, for former customers, to the last postal address ascertainable after reasonable investigation using commonly available sources; or

(ii) Other electronic means of active communications agreed upon by the customer for contacting that customer for data breach notification purposes.

(2) The customer notification required to be provided under this paragraph must include:

(i) The date, estimated date, or estimated date range of the breach of security;

(ii) A description of the customer PI that was breached or reasonably believed to have been breached;

(iii) Information the customer can use to contact the telecommunications carrier to inquire about the breach of security and the customer PI that the telecommunications carrier maintains about that customer;

(iv) Information about how to contact the Federal Communications Commission and any state regulatory agencies relevant to the customer and the service; and

(v) If the breach creates a risk of financial harm, information about the national credit-reporting agencies and the steps customers can take to guard against identity theft, including any credit monitoring, credit reporting, credit freezes, or other consumer protections the telecommunications carrier is offering customers affected by the breach of security.

(b) *Commission notification.* A telecommunications carrier must notify the Commission of any breach affecting 5,000 or more customers no later than seven business days after the carrier reasonably determines that a breach has occurred and at least three business days before notification to the affected customers, unless the telecommunications carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. A telecommunications carrier must notify the Commission of any breach affecting fewer than 5,000 customers without unreasonable delay and no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the carrier reasonably determines that a breach has occurred, unless the telecommunications carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. Such notification shall be made through a central reporting system made available by the Commission.

(c) *Federal law enforcement notification.* A telecommunications carrier must notify the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service) of a breach that affects 5,000 or more customers no later than seven business days after the carrier reasonably determines that such a breach has occurred and at least three business days before notification to the affected customers, unless the telecommunications carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. Such notification shall be made through a central reporting system made available by the Commission.

(d) *Recordkeeping.* A telecommunications carrier shall maintain a record, electronically or in some other manner, of any breaches and notifications made to customers, unless the telecommunications carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. The record must include the dates on which the carrier determines that a reportable breach has occurred and the dates of customer notification. The record must include a written copy of all customer notifications. Carriers shall retain the record for a minimum of two years from the date on which the carrier determines that a reportable breach has occurred.
