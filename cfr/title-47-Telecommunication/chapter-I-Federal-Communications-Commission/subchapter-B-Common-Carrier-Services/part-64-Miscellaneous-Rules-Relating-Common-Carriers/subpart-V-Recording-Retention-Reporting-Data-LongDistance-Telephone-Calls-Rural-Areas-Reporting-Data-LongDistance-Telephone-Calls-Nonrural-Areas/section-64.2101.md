*Operating company number (OCN).* The term “operating company number” means a four-place alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies a local exchange carrier.

*Rural OCN.* The term “rural OCN” means an operating company number that uniquely identifies an incumbent LEC (as defined in § 51.5 of this chapter) that is a rural telephone company (as defined in § 51.5 of this chapter).
