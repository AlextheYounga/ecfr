##### § 25.146 Licensing and operating rules for the NGSO FSS in the 10.7-14.5 GHz bands. #####

(a) A comprehensive technical showing shall be submitted for the proposed non-geostationary satellite orbit Fixed-Satellite Service (NGSO FSS) system in the 10.7-14.5 GHz bands. The technical information shall demonstrate that the proposed NGSO FSS system would not exceed the validation equivalent power flux-density (EPFD) limits as specified in § 25.208 (g), (k), and (l) for EPFDdown, and EPFDup. If the technical demonstration exceeds the validation EPFD limits at any test points within the U.S. for domestic service and at any points outside of the U.S. for international service or at any points in the geostationary satellite orbit, as appropriate, the application would be unacceptable for filing and will be returned to the applicant with a brief statement identifying the non-compliance technical demonstration. The technical showing consists of the following:

(1) *Single-entry validation equivalent power flux-density, in the space-to-Earth direction, (EPFD*down) *limits.* (i) Provide a set of power flux-density (PFD) masks, on the surface of the Earth, for each space station in the NGSO FSS system. The PFD masks shall be generated in accordance with the specification stipulated in the most recent version of ITU-R S.1503-2 (incorporated by reference, *see* § 25.108). In particular, the PFD masks must encompass the power flux-density radiated by the space station regardless of the satellite transmitter power resource allocation and traffic/beam switching strategy that are used at different periods of a NGSO FSS system's life. The PFD masks shall also be in an electronic form that can be accessed by the computer program specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

(ii) Identify and describe in detail the assumptions and conditions used in generating the power flux-density masks.

(iii) If a computer program that has been approved by the ITU for determining compliance with the single-entry EPFDdown validation limits is not yet available, the applicant shall provide a computer program for the single-entry EPFDdown validation computation, including both the source code and the executable file. This computer program shall be developed in accordance with the specification stipulated in the most recent version of Recommendation ITU-R S.1503. If the applicant uses the ITU approved software, the applicant shall indicate the program name and the version used.

(iv) Identify and describe in detail the necessary input parameters for the execution of the computer program identified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

(v) Provide the result, the cumulative probability distribution function of EPFD, of the execution of the computer program described in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section by using only the input parameters contained in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(1)(iv) of this section.

(2) *Single-entry additional operational equivalent power flux-density, in the Earth-to-space direction, (additional operational EPFD*up) *limits.* (i) Provide a set of NGSO FSS earth station maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP) masks as a function of the off-axis angle generated by an NGSO FSS earth station. The maximum EIRP mask shall be generated in accordance with the specification stipulated in the most recent version of ITU-R Recommendation S.1503. In particular, the results of calculations encompass what would be radiated regardless of the earth station transmitter power resource allocation and traffic/beam switching strategy are used at different periods of an NGSO FSS system's life. The EIRP masks shall be in an electronic form that can be accessed by the computer program specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.

(ii) Identify and describe in detail the assumptions and conditions used in generating the maximum earth station e.i.r.p. mask.

(iii) If a computer program that has been approved by the ITU for determining compliance with the single-entry EPFDup validation limits is not yet available, the applicant shall provide a computer program for the single-entry EPFDup validation computation, including both the source code and the executable file. This computer program shall be developed in accordance with the specification stipulated in the most recent version of Recommendation ITU-R S.1503. If the applicant uses the ITU approved software, the applicant shall indicate the program name and the version used.

(iv) Identify and describe in detail the necessary input parameters for the execution of the computer program identified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.

(v) Provide the result of the execution of the computer program described in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section by using only the input parameters contained in paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (a)(2)(iv) of this section.

(b) Ninety days prior to the initiation of service to the public, the NGSO FSS system licensee shall submit a comprehensive technical showing for the non-geostationary satellite orbit Fixed-Satellite Service (NGSO FSS) system in the 10.7-14.5 GHz bands. The technical information shall demonstrate that the NGSO FSS system is expected not to operate in excess of the additional operational EPFDdown limits and the operational EPFDdown limits as specified in § 25.208(i) and (j), and notes 2 and 3 to Table 1L in § 25.208(*l*). If the technical demonstration exceeds the additional operational EPFDdown limits or the operational EPFDdown limits at any test points within the United States for domestic service and at any test points outside of the United States for international service, the NGSO FSS system licensee shall not initiate service to the public until the deficiency has been rectified by reducing satellite transmission power or other adjustments. This must be substantiated by subsequent technical showings. The technical showings consist of the following:

(1) *Single-entry additional operational equivalent power flux-density, in the space-to-Earth direction, (additional operational EPFD*down*) limits.* (i) Provide a set of anticipated operational power flux density (PFD) masks, on the surface of the Earth, for each space station in the NGSO FSS system. The anticipated operational PFD masks could be generated by using the method specified in the most recent version of ITU-R Recommendation S.1503. In particular, the anticipated operational PFD mask shall take into account the expected maximum traffic loading distributions and geographic specific scheduling of the actual measured space station antenna patterns (see § 25.210(k)). The anticipated operational PFD masks shall also be in an electronic form that can be accessed by the computer program contained in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.

(ii) Identify and describe in detail the assumptions and conditions used in generating the anticipated operational power flux-density masks.

(iii) Provide a computer program for the single-entry additional operational EPFDdown verification computation, including both the source code and the executable file. This computer program could be developed by using the method specified in the most recent version of ITU-R Recommendation S.1503.

(iv) Identify and describe in detail the necessary input parameters for the execution of the additional operational EPFDdown verification computer program identified in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.

(v) Provide the result, the cumulative probability distribution function of EPFD, of the execution of the verification computer program described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section by using only the input parameters contained in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) and (iv) of this section for each of the submitted test points provided by the Commission. These test points are based on information from U.S.-licensed geostationary satellite orbit Fixed-Satellite Service and Broadcasting-Satellite Service operators in the 10.7-14.5 GHz bands. Each U.S.-licensed geostationary satellite orbit Fixed-Satellite Service and Broadcasting-Satellite Service operator in the 10.7-14.5 GHz bands may submit up to 10 test points for this section containing the latitude, longitude, altitude, azimuth, elevation angle, antenna size, efficiency to be used by non-geostationary satellite orbit Fixed-Satellite Service licensees in the 10.7-14.5 GHz bands during the upcoming year.

(2) Operational equivalent power flux-density, space-to-Earth direction, (operational EPFDdown) limits. Using the information contained in (b)(1) of this section plus the measured space station antenna patterns, provide the result of the execution of the computer simulation for the anticipated in-line operational EPFDdown levels for each of the submitted test points provided by the Commission. Submitted test points are based on inputs from U.S.-licensed geostationary satellite orbit Fixed-Satellite Service and Broadcasting-Satellite Service operators in the 10.7- 14.5 GHz bands. Each U.S.-licensed geostationary satellite orbit Fixed-Satellite Service and Broadcasting-Satellite Service operator in the 10.7-14.5 GHz bands may submit up to 10 test points for this section containing the latitude, longitude, altitude, azimuth, elevation angle, antenna size, efficiency to be used by non-geostationary satellite orbit Fixed-Satellite Service licensees in the 10.7-14.5 GHz bands during the upcoming year.

(d) The Commission may request at any time additional information from the NGSO FSS system applicant or licensee concerning the EPFD levels and the related technical showings.

(e) An NGSO FSS system licensee operating a system in compliance with the limits specified in § 25.208(g), (i), (j), (k), (l), and (m) shall be considered as having fulfilled its obligations under ITU Radio Regulations Article 22.2 with respect to any GSO network. However, such NGSO FSS system shall not claim protection from GSO FSS and BSS networks operating in accordance with part 25 of this chapter and the ITU Radio Regulations.

(f) Coordination will be required between NGSO FSS systems and GSO FSS earth stations in the frequency band 10.7-12.75 GHz when all of the following threshold conditions are met:

(1) Bandwidth overlap; and

(2) The satellite network using the GSO has specific receive earth stations which meet all of the following conditions: earth station antenna maximum isotropic gain greater than or equal to 64 dBi; G/T of 44 dB/K or higher; and emission bandwidth of 250 MHz; and the EPFDdown radiated by the satellite system using the NGSO into the GSO specific receive earth station, either within the U.S. for domestic service or any points outside the U.S. for international service, as calculated using the ITU software for examining compliance with EPFD limits set forth in Article 22 of the ITU Radio Regulations exceeds −174.5 dB(W/(m2/40kHz)) for any percentage of time for NGSO systems with all satellites only operating at or below 2500 km altitude, or −202 dB(W/(m2/40kHz)) for any percentage of time for NGSO systems with any satellites operating above 2500 km altitude.

(3) If there is no ITU software for examining compliance with EPFD limits set forth in Article 22 of the ITU Radio Regulations, then the EPFDdown coordination trigger is suspended and the requirement for coordination will be based on bandwidth overlap and the satellite network using the GSO has specific receive earth stations which meet all of the following conditions: earth station antenna maximum isotropic gain greater than or equal to 64 dBi; G/T of 44 dB/K or higher; and emission bandwidth of 250 MHz.
