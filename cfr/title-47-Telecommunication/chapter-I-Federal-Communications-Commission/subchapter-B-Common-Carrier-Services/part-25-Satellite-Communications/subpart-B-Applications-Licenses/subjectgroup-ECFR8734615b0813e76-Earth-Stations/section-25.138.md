##### § 25.138 Licensing requirements for GSO FSS earth stations in the conventional Ka-band and the 24.75-25.25 GHz band. #####

(a) Applications for earth station licenses in the GSO FSS in the conventional Ka-band or the 24.75-25.25 GHz band that indicate that the following requirements will be met and include the information required by relevant provisions in §§ 25.115 and 25.130 may be routinely processed:

(1) The EIRP density of co-polarized signals in the plane tangent to the GSO arc, as defined in § 25.103, will not exceed the following values under clear sky conditions:

|32.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz| for 2.0° ≤ θ ≤ 7°.  |
|:------------|:------|:--------------------|
|    11.5     |dBW/MHz|  for 7° ≤ θ ≤ 9.2°  |
|35.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|for 9.2° ≤ θ ≤ 19.1° |
|     3.5     |dBW/MHz|for 19.1° \< θ ≤ 180°|

Where:θ is the angle in degrees from a line from the earth station antenna to the assigned orbital location of the target satellite.

(2) In the plane perpendicular to the GSO arc, as defined in § 25.103, the EIRP density of co-polarized signals will not exceed the following values under clear sky conditions:

|35.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|  for 3.5° ≤ θ ≤ 7°  |
|:------------|:------|:--------------------|
|    14.4     |dBW/MHz| for 7° \< θ ≤ 9.2°  |
|38.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|for 9.2° \< θ ≤ 19.1°|
|     6.5     |dBW/MHz|for 19.1° \< θ ≤ 180°|

Where θ is as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(3) The EIRP density levels specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section may be exceeded by up to 3 dB, for values of θ \> 7°, over 10% of the range of theta (θ) angles from 7-180° on each side of the line from the earth station to the target satellite.

(4) The EIRP density of cross-polarized signals will not exceed the following values in the plane tangent to the GSO arc or in the plane perpendicular to the GSO arc under clear sky conditions:

|22.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|for  <br/>2.0° \< θ ≤ 7.0°|
|:------------|:------|:-------------------------|

Where θ is as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(5) A license application for earth station operation in a network using variable power density control of earth stations transmitting simultaneously in shared frequencies to the same target satellite receiving beam may be routinely processed if the applicant certifies that the aggregate off-axis EIRP density from all co-frequency earth stations transmitting simultaneously to the same target satellite receiving beam, not resulting from colliding data bursts transmitted pursuant to a contention protocol, will not exceed the off-axis EIRP density limits permissible for a single earth station, as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.

(6) The pfd at the Earth's surface produced by emissions from a space station operating in the conventional Ka-band, for all conditions including clear sky, and for all methods of modulation, shall not exceed a level of −118 dBW/m2/MHz, in addition to the limits specified in § 25.208(d).

(b) Operation with off-axis EIRP density exceeding a relevant envelope specified in paragraph (a) of this section and applications proposing such operation are subject to coordination requirements in § 25.220.

(c)-(e) [Reserved]

(f) The holder of a blanket license pursuant to this section will be responsible for operation of any transceiver to receive service provided by that licensee or provided by another party with the blanket licensee's consent. Space station operators may not transmit communications to or from user transceivers in the United States in the 18.3-18.8 GHz, 19.7-20.2 GHz, 28.35-28.6 GHz, or 29.25-30.0 GHz band unless such communications are authorized under an FCC earth station license.
