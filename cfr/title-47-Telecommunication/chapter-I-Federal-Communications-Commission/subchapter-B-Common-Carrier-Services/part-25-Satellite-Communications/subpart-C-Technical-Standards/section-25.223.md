##### § 25.223 Alternative licensing rules for feeder-link earth stations in the 17/24 GHz BSS. #####

(a) This section applies to license applications for earth stations that transmit to 17/24 GHz Broadcasting-Satellite Service space stations that are not eligible for routine processing under § 25.212(f).

(b) Applications for earth station licenses in the 24.75-25.25 GHz portion of 17/24 GHz BSS may be routinely processed if they meet the following requirements:

(1) The EIRP density of co-polarized signals will not exceed the following values in the plane tangent to the GSO arc, as defined in § 25.103, under clear sky conditions:

|             |       |                     |
|-------------|-------|---------------------|
|32.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|  for 2° ≤ θ ≤ 7°.   |
|    11.4     |dBW/MHz| for 7° ≤ θ ≤ 9.2°.  |
|35.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|for 9.2° ≤ θ ≤ 19.1°.|
|     3.5     |dBW/MHz|for 19.1° ≤ θ ≤ 180°.|

Where θ is the angle in degrees from a line from the earth station antenna to the assigned orbital location of the target satellite.

(2) The EIRP density of co-polarized signals will not exceed the following values under clear sky conditions in the plane perpendicular to the GSO arc, as defined in § 25.103:

|             |       |                     |
|-------------|-------|---------------------|
|35.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|  for 2° ≤ θ ≤ 7°.   |
|    14.4     |dBW/MHz| for 7° ≤ θ ≤ 9.2°.  |
|38.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|for 9.2° ≤ θ ≤ 19.1°.|
|     6.5     |dBW/MHz|for 19.1° ≤ θ ≤ 180°.|

Where θ is as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) The EIRP density levels specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section may be exceeded by up to 3 dB for values of θ \> 7°, in 10% of the range of theta (θ) angles from 7°-180° on each side of the line from the earth station to the target satellite.

(4) The EIRP density of cross-polarized signals will not exceed the following values in the plane tangent to the GSO arc or in the plane perpendicular to the GSO arc, under clear sky conditions:

|             |       |                |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
|22.5-25log(θ)|dBW/MHz|for 2° ≤ θ ≤ 7°.|

Where θ is as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(c) An applicant proposing levels in excess of those specified in paragraph (b) of this section must certify that potentially affected parties acknowledge and do not object to the use of the applicant's higher EIRP densities.

(1) For proposed non-conforming EIRP density levels up to 3 dB in excess of the limits defined in paragraph (b) of this section, potentially affected parties are operators of co-frequency U.S.-authorized 17/24 GHz BSS space stations at angular separations of up to ±6° from the proposed satellite points of communication. For proposed EIRP density levels more than 3 dB but not more than 6 dB in excess of the limits defined in paragraph (b) of this section, potentially affected parties are operators of co-frequency U.S.-authorized space stations up to ±10° from the proposed satellite points of communication.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, an applicant need not certify that the operator of a co-frequency space station consents to proposed non-conforming operation if EIRP density from the proposed earth station will not exceed the levels specified in paragraph (b) toward any position in the geostationary arc within one degree of the assigned orbital location of the co-frequency space station.

(3) Power density levels more than 6 dB in excess of the limits defined in paragraph (b) of this section will not be permitted.

(d)(1) The operator of an earth station licensed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will bear the burden of coordinating with the operator of a co-frequency space station subsequently licensed by the Commission for operation at an orbital location 10° or less from the earth station's target satellite if the co-frequency space station's reception of conforming uplink transmissions is, or would be, adversely affected by the earth station's non-conforming operation. If no agreement is reached, the earth station operator must reduce EIRP density toward that co-frequency space station to a level in conformance with the envelopes specified in paragraph (b) of this section.

(2) The operator of an earth station licensed pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section must reduce EIRP density to levels at or within those specified in paragraph (b) toward a U.S.-licensed space station receiving in the same uplink band at an angular separation from the earth station's target satellite greater than is required in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the co-frequency space station's reception of conforming uplink transmissions is adversely affected by the non-conforming earth station operation, unless the non-conforming operation is permitted under a coordination agreement with the operator of the co-frequency space station.
