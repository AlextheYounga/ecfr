Where θ is as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

(ii) Each ESAA transmitter shall meet one of the following antenna pointing requirements:

(A) Each ESAA transmitter shall maintain a pointing error of less than or equal to 0.2° between the orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESAA antenna; or

(B) Each ESAA transmitter shall declare a maximum antenna pointing error that may be greater than 0.2° provided that the ESAA does not exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, taking into account the antenna pointing error.

(iii) Each ESAA transmitter shall meet one of the following cessation of emission requirements:

(A) For ESAAs operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, all emissions from the ESAA shall automatically cease within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESAA antenna exceeds 0.5°, and transmission shall not resume until such angle is less than or equal to 0.2°, or

(B) For ESAA transmitters operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, all emissions from the ESAA shall automatically cease within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESAA antenna exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error and shall not resume transmissions until such angle is less than or equal to the declared maximum antenna pointing error.

(2) The following requirements apply to ESAA systems that operate with off-axis EIRP spectral-densities in excess of the levels in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section under licenses granted based on certifications filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(i) An ESAA or ESAA system licensed based on certifications filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section must operate in accordance with the off-axis EIRP density specifications provided to the target satellite operator in order to obtain the certifications.

(ii) Any ESAA transmitter operating under a license granted based on certifications filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be self-monitoring and capable of shutting itself off and must cease or reduce emissions within 100 milliseconds after generating off-axis EIRP-density in excess of the specifications supplied to the target satellite operator.

(iii) A system with variable power control of individual ESAA transmitters must monitor the aggregate off-axis EIRP density from simultaneously transmitting ESAA transmitters at the system's network control and monitoring center. If simultaneous operation of two or more ESAA transmitters causes aggregate off-axis EIRP density to exceed the off-axis EIRP density specifications supplied to the target satellite operator, the network control and monitoring center must command those transmitters to cease emissions or reduce the aggregate EIRP density to a level at or below those specifications, and the transmitters must comply within 100 milliseconds of receiving the command.

(3) The following requirements apply to an ESAA system that uses variable power-density control of individual ESAA earth stations transmitting simultaneously in the same frequencies to the same target satellite, unless the system operates pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(i) Aggregate EIRP density from co-frequency earth stations in each target satellite receiving beam, not resulting from colliding data bursts transmitted pursuant to a contention protocol, will not exceed the limits specified in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

(ii) Each ESAA transmitter must be self-monitoring and capable of shutting itself off and must cease or reduce emissions within 100 milliseconds after generating off-axis EIRP density in excess of the limit in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.

(iii) A system with variable power control of individual ESAA transmitters must monitor aggregate power density from simultaneously transmitting ESAA transmitters at the network control and monitoring center. If simultaneous operation of two or more transmitters causes aggregate off-axis EIRP density to exceed the off-axis EIRP density limit in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the network control and monitoring center must command those transmitters to cease emissions or reduce the aggregate EIRP density to a level at or below that limit, and those transmitters must comply within 100 milliseconds of receiving the command.

(4) An applicant filing to operate an ESAA terminal or system and planning to use a contention protocol shall certify that its contention protocol use will be reasonable.

(5) There shall be a point of contact in the United States, with phone number and address, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with authority and ability to cease all emissions from the ESAA.

(6) For each ESAA transmitter, a record of the vehicle location (*i.e.,* latitude/longitude/altitude), transmit frequency, channel bandwidth and satellite used shall be time annotated and maintained for a period of not less than one year. Records shall be recorded at time intervals no greater than one (1) minute while the ESAA is transmitting. The ESAA operator shall make this data available, in the form of a comma delimited electronic spreadsheet, within 24 hours of a request from the Commission, NTIA, or a frequency coordinator for purposes of resolving harmful interference events. A description of the units (*i.e.,* degrees, minutes, MHz \* \* \*.) in which the records values are recorded will be supplied along with the records.

(7) In the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 11.45-11.7 GHz (space-to-Earth) frequency bands ESAAs shall not claim protection from interference from any authorized terrestrial stations to which frequencies are either already assigned, or may be assigned in the future.

(8) An ESAA terminal receiving in the 11.7-12.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) bands shall receive protection from interference caused by space stations other than the target space station only to the degree to which harmful interference would not be expected to be caused to an earth station employing an antenna conforming to the referenced patterns defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 25.209 and stationary at the location at which any interference occurred.

(9) Each ESAA terminal shall automatically cease transmitting within 100 milliseconds upon loss of reception of the satellite downlink signal or when it detects that unintended satellite tracking has happened or is about to happen.

(10) Each ESAA terminal should be subject to the monitoring and control by an NCMC or equivalent facility. Each terminal must be able to receive at least “enable transmission” and “disable transmission” commands from the NCMC and must automatically cease transmissions immediately on receiving any “parameter change command,” which may cause harmful interference during the change, until it receives an “enable transmission” command from its NCMC. In addition, the NCMC must be able to monitor the operation of an ESAA terminal to determine if it is malfunctioning.

(11) Each ESAA terminal shall be self-monitoring and, should a fault which can cause harmful interference to FSS networks be detected, the terminal must automatically cease transmissions.

(12) Unless otherwise stated all ESAA system that comply with the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section may request Permitted List authority.

(13) ESAA providers operating in the international airspace within line-of-sight of the territory of a foreign administration where fixed service networks have primary allocation in this band, the maximum power flux density (pfd) produced at the surface of the Earth by emissions from a single aircraft carrying an ESAA terminal should not exceed the following values unless the foreign Administration has imposed other conditions for protecting its fixed service stations:

|               |                           |   |            |
|---------------|---------------------------|---|------------|
|\-132 + 0.5 · θ|dB(W/(m<sup>2</sup> · MHz))|For|   θ ≤40°   |
|     \-112     |dB(W/(m<sup>2</sup> · MHz))|For|40° \<θ ≤90°|

Where: θ is the angle of arrival of the radio-frequency wave (degrees above the horizontal) and the aforementioned limits relate to the pfd and angles of arrival would be obtained under free-space propagation conditions.

(14) All ESAA terminals operated in U.S. airspace, whether on U.S.-registered civil aircraft or non-U.S.-registered civil aircraft, must be licensed by the Commission. All ESAA terminals on U.S.-registered civil aircraft operating outside of U.S. airspace must be licensed by the Commission, except as provided by section 303(t) of the Communications Act.

(15) For ESAA systems operating over international waters, ESAA operators will certify that their target space station operators have confirmed that proposed ESAA operations are within coordinated parameters for adjacent satellites up to 6 degrees away on the geostationary arc.

(16) Prior to operations within the foreign nation's airspace, the ESAA operator will ascertain whether the relevant administration has operations that could be affected by ESAA terminals, and will determine whether that administration has adopted specific requirements concerning ESAA operations. When the aircraft enters foreign airspace, the ESAA terminal would be required to operate under the Commission's rules, or those of the foreign administration, whichever is more constraining. To the extent that all relevant administrations have identified geographic areas from which ESAA operations would not affect their radio operations, ESAA operators would be free to operate within those identified areas without further action. To the extent that the foreign administration has not adopted requirements regarding ESAA operations, ESAA operators would be required to coordinate their operations with any potentially affected operations.
