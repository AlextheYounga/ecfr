(a) The following ongoing requirements govern all ESV licensees and operations in the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth), 11.45-11.7 GHz (space-to-Earth), 11.7-12.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 14.0-14.5 GHz (Earth-to-space) bands transmitting to GSO satellites in the Fixed-Satellite Service.ESV licensees must comply with the requirements in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section and all of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a)(4) through (a)(8) of this section. Paragraph (b) of this section identifies items that must be included in the application for ESV operations to demonstrate that these ongoing requirements will be met.

(1) The following requirements shall apply to an ESV that uses transmitters with off-axis effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) spectral-densities lower than or equal to the levels in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. An ESV, or ESV system, operating under this section shall provide a detailed demonstration as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The ESV transmitter also must comply with the antenna pointing and cessation of emission requirements in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii) of this section.

(i)(A) Off-axis EIRP spectral density emitted in the plane tangent to the GSO arc, as defined in § 25.103, shall not exceed the following values:

|   −14   |dBW/4kHz |for 19.1° \< θ ≤ 180°.|

Where theta (θ) is the angle in degrees from a line from the earth station antenna to the assigned orbital location of the target satellite. The EIRP density levels specified for θ \> 7° may be exceeded by up to 3 dB in up to 10% of the range of theta (θ) angles from ±7-180°, and by up to 6 dB in the region of main reflector spillover energy.

|18-25logθ|dBW/4 kHz|for 3.0° ≤ θ ≤ 19.1°. |
|:--------|:--------|:---------------------|
|   −14   |dBW/4kHz |for 19.1° \< θ ≤ 180°.|

Where θ is as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section. These EIRP density levels may be exceeded by up to 6 dB in the region of main reflector spillover energy and in up to 10% of the range of θ angles not included in that region, on each side of the line from the earth station to the target satellite.

(C) The off-axis EIRP density of cross-polarized signals shall not exceed the following values in the plane tangent to the GSO arc or in the plane perpendicular to the GSO arc:

Where θ is as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(A) of this section.

(ii) Except for ESV systems operating under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, each ESV transmitter must meet one of the following antenna pointing error requirements:

(A) Each ESV transmitter shall maintain a pointing error of less than or equal to 0.2° between the orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna, or

(B) Each ESV transmitter shall declare a maximum antenna pointing error that may be greater than 0.2° provided that the ESV does not exceed the off-axis EIRP spectral-density limits in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, taking into account the antenna pointing error.

(iii) Except for ESV systems operating under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, each ESV transmitter must meet one of the following cessation of emission requirements:

(A) For ESVs operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, all emissions from the ESV shall automatically cease within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna exceeds 0.5°, and transmission will not resume until such angle is less than or equal to 0.2°, or

(B) For ESV transmitters operating under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(B) of this section, all emissions from the ESV shall automatically cease within 100 milliseconds if the angle between the orbital location of the target satellite and the axis of the main lobe of the ESV antenna exceeds the declared maximum antenna pointing error and shall not resume transmissions until such angle is less than or equal to the declared maximum antenna pointing error.

(2) The following requirements apply to ESV systems that operate with off-axis EIRP spectral-densities in excess of the levels in paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section under licenses granted based on certifications filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(iii) A system with variable power control of individual ESV transmitters must monitor the aggregate off-axis EIRP density from simultaneously transmitting ESV transmitters at the system's network control and monitoring center. If simultaneous operation of two or more ESV transmitters causes aggregate off-axis EIRP density to exceed the off-axis EIRP-density specifications supplied to the target satellite operator, the network control and monitoring center must command those transmitters to cease emissions or reduce the aggregate EIRP density to a level at or below those specifications, and the transmitters must comply within 100 milliseconds of receiving the command.

(3) The following requirements apply to an ESV system that uses variable power control of individual earth stations transmitting simultaneously in the same frequencies to the same target satellite, unless the ESV system operates pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

(i) Aggregate EIRP density from co-frequency earth stations in each target satellite receiving beam, not resulting from colliding data bursts transmitted pursuant to a contention protocol, will not exceed the limits defined in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.

(ii) Each ESV transmitter must be self-monitoring and capable of shutting itself off and must cease or reduce emissions within 100 milliseconds after generating off-axis EIRP density in excess of the limit in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.

(iii) Aggregate power density from simultaneously transmitting ESV transmitters must be monitored at the system's network control and monitoring center. If simultaneous operation of two or more ESV transmitters causes aggregate off-axis EIRP density to exceed the off-axis EIRP density limit in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section, the network control and monitoring center must command those transmitters to cease emissions or reduce the aggregate EIRP density to a level at or below that limit, and those transmitters must comply within 100 milliseconds of receiving the command.

(4) There shall be a point of contact in the United States, with phone number and address, available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with authority and ability to cease all emissions from the ESVs, either directly or through the facilities of a U.S. Hub or a Hub located in another country with which the United States has a bilateral agreement that enables such cessation of emissions.

(5) For each ESV transmitter, a record of the ship location (*i.e.,* latitude/longitude), transmit frequency, channel bandwidth and satellite used shall be time annotated and maintained for a period of not less than 1 year. Records will be recorded at time intervals no greater than every 20 minutes while the ESV is transmitting. The ESV operator will make this data available upon request to a coordinator, fixed system operator, Fixed-Satellite system operator, NTIA, or the Commission within 24 hours of the request.

(6) ESV operators communicating with vessels of foreign registry must maintain detailed information on each vessel's country of registry and a point of contact for the relevant administration responsible for licensing ESVs.

(7) ESV operators shall control all ESVs by a Hub earth station located in the United States, except that an ESV on U.S.-registered vessels may operate under control of a Hub earth station location outside the United States provided the ESV operator maintains a point of contact within the United States that will have the capability and authority to cause an ESV on a U.S.-registered vessel to cease transmitting if necessary.

(8) In the 10.95-11.2 GHz (space-to-Earth) and 11.45-11.7 GHz (space-to-Earth) frequency bands ESVs shall not claim protection from interference from any authorized terrestrial stations to which frequencies are either already assigned, or may be assigned in the future.
