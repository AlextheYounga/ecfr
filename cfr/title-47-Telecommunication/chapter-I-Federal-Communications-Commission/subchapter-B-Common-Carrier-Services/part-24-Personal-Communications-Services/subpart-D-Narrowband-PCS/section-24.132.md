(2) For heights between the values listed in the table, linear interpolation shall be used to determine maximum e.r.p.

(e) MTA and regional base stations located less than 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the licensed service area border must limit their effective radiated power in accordance with the following formula:

PW = 0.0175 × dkm\* \* 6.6666 × x hm\* \* − 3.1997PW is effective radiated power in wattsdkm is distance in kilometershm is antenna HAAT in meters; see § 24.53 for HAAT calculation method

(f) All power levels specified in this section are expressed in terms of the maximum power, averaged over a 100 millisecond interval, when measured with instrumentation calibrated in terms of an rms-equivalent voltage with a resolution bandwidth equal to or greater than the authorized bandwidth.

(g) Additionally, PCS stations will be subject to any power limits imposed by international agreements.
