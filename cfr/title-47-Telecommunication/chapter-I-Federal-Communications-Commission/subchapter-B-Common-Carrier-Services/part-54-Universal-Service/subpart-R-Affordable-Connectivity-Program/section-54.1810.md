(2) A participating provider shall not terminate an eligible household's service subject to the affordable connectivity benefit on the grounds that the household has failed to pay the charges set forth on a bill for such service unless 90 consecutive days have passed since the bill payment due date.

(e) *Upselling and downselling* - (1) *Prohibition of inappropriate upselling and downselling.* A participating provider and its agents shall not exert pressure on an eligible household to induce the purchase of a broadband internet access service or bundled plan that is more costly, less costly, affords different features, provides higher or lower speed or bandwidth, is subject to higher or lower data caps, or is bundled with additional services, equipment, or features, or fewer services, equipment, or features, than the service or plan that the household is already purchasing or has inquired about purchasing through the Affordable Connectivity Program.

(2) *Specific prohibited activities.* Prohibited activities include, but are not limited to:
