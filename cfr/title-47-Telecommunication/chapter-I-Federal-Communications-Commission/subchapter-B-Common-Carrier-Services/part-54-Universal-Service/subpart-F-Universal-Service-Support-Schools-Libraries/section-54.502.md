(a) *Supported services.* All supported services are listed in the Eligible Services List as updated annually in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. The services in this subpart will be supported in addition to all reasonable charges that are incurred by taking such services, such as state and federal taxes. Charges for termination liability, penalty surcharges, and other charges not included in the cost of taking such service shall not be covered by the universal service support mechanisms. The supported services fall within the following general categories:

(1) *Category one.* Telecommunications services, telecommunications, and Internet access, as defined in § 54.5 and described in the Eligible Services List are category one supported services.

(2) *Category two.* Internal connections, basic maintenance and managed internal broadband services as defined in § 54.500 and described in the Eligible Services List are category two supported services.

(b) *Funding years 2015-2019.* Libraries, schools, or school districts with schools that receive funding for category two services in any of the funding years between 2015 and 2019 shall be eligible for support for category two services pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1) through (6) of this section.

(1) *Five-year budget.* Each eligible school or library shall be eligible for a budgeted amount of support for category two services over a five-year funding cycle beginning the first funding year support is received. Excluding support for internal connections received prior to funding year 2015, each school or library shall be eligible for the total available budget less any support received for category two services in the prior funding years of that school's or library's five-year funding cycle. The budgeted amounts and the funding floor shall be adjusted for inflation annually in accordance with § 54.507(a)(2).

(2) *School budget.* Each eligible school shall be eligible for support for category two services up to a pre-discount price of $150 per student over a five-year funding cycle. Applicants shall provide the student count per school, calculated at the time that the discount is calculated each funding year. New schools may estimate the number of students, but shall repay any support provided in excess of the maximum budget based on student enrollment the following funding year.

(3) *Library budget.* Each eligible library shall be eligible for support for category two services, up to a pre-discount price of $2.30 per square foot over a five-year funding cycle. Libraries shall provide the total area for all floors, in square feet, of each library outlet separately, including all areas enclosed by the outer walls of the library outlet and occupied by the library, including those areas off-limits to the public.

(4) *Funding floor.* Each eligible school and library will be eligible for support for category two services up to at least a pre-discount price of $9,200 over five funding years.

(5) *Requests.* Applicants shall request support for category two services for each school or library based on the number of students per school building or square footage per library building. Category two funding for a school or library may not be used for another school or library. If an applicant requests less than the maximum budget available for a school or library, the applicant may request the remaining balance in a school's or library's category two budget in subsequent funding years of a five year cycle. The costs for category two services shared by multiple eligible entities shall be divided reasonably between each of the entities for which support is sought in that funding year.

(6) *Non-instructional buildings.* Support is not available for category two services provided to or within non-instructional school buildings or separate library administrative buildings unless those category two services are essential for the effective transport of information to or within one or more instructional buildings of a school or non-administrative library buildings, or the Commission has found that the use of those services meets the definition of educational purpose, as defined in § 54.500. When applying for category two support for eligible services to a non-instructional school building or library administrative building, the applicant shall allocate the cost of providing services to one or more of the eligible school or library buildings that benefit from those services being provided.

(c) *Funding year 2020.* Libraries, schools, or school districts with schools that receive funding for category two services in funding year 2020 shall be eligible for support for category two services pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.

(1) *Six-year funding cycle.* Each eligible school or library shall be eligible for a budgeted amount of support for category two services over a six-year funding cycle. Each school or library shall be eligible for the total available budget less the pre-discount amount of any support received for category two services in the prior funding years of that school's or library's six-year funding cycle.

(2) *School budget.* Each eligible school shall be eligible for support for category two services up to a pre-discount price of $150 plus an additional prorated 20% (adjusted for inflation dating back to funding year 2015) over six funding years that will be completed at the end of funding year 2020. Applicants shall provide the student count per school, calculated at the time that the discount is calculated each funding year. New schools may estimate the number of students but shall repay any support provided in excess of the maximum budget based on student enrollment the following funding year.

(3) *Library budget.* Each eligible library located within the Institute of Museum and Library Services locale codes of “11 - City, Large,” defined as a territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a population of 250,000 or more, “12 - City, Midsize,” defined as a territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a population less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000, or “21 - Suburb, Large,” defined as a territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with population of 250,000 or more, shall be eligible for support for category two services, up to a pre-discount price of $5.00 per square foot plus an additional prorated 20% (adjusted for inflation dating back to funding year 2015) over six funding years that will be completed at the end of funding year 2020. All other eligible libraries shall be eligible for support for category two services, up to a pre-discount price of $2.30 per square foot plus an additional prorated 20% (adjusted for inflation dating back to funding year 2015) over a six-year funding cycle that will be completed at the end of funding year 2020.

(5) *Requests.* Applicants shall request support for category two services for each school or library based on the number of students per school building or square footage per library building. Category two funding for a school or library may not be used for another school or library. The costs for category two services shared by multiple eligible entities shall be divided reasonably between each of the entities for which support is sought in that funding year.

(6) *Non-instructional buildings.* Support is not available for category two services provided to or within non-instructional school buildings or separate library administrative buildings unless those category two services are essential for the effective transport of information to or within one or more instructional buildings of a school or non-administrative library buildings, or the Commission has found that the use of those services meets the definition of educational purpose, as defined in § 54.500. When applying for category two support for eligible services to a non-instructional school building or library administrative building, the applicant shall allocate the cost of providing services to one or more of the eligible school or library buildings that benefit from those services being provided.

(d) *Eligible services list process.* The Administrator shall submit by March 30 of each year a draft list of services eligible for support, based on the Commission's rules for the following funding year.
