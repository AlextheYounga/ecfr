##### § 27.1310 Protection of Broadcast Television Service in the 600 MHz band from wireless operations. #####

(a) Licensees authorized to operate wireless services in the 600 MHz band must cause no harmful interference to public reception of the signals of broadcast television stations transmitting co-channel or on an adjacent channel.

(1) Such wireless operations must comply with the D/U ratios in Table 5 in OET Bulletin No. 74, Methodology for Predicting Inter-Service Interference to Broadcast Television from Mobile Wireless Broadband Services in the UHF Band ([DATE]) (“*OET Bulletin No. 74*”). Copies of *OET Bulletin No. 74* may be inspected during normal business hours at the Federal Communications Commission, 445 12th St. SW., Dockets Branch (Room CY A09257), Washington, DC 20554. This document is also available through the Internet on the *FCC Home Page at http://www.fcc.gov.*

(2) If a 600 MHz band licensee causes harmful interference within the noise-limited contour or protected contour of a broadcast television station that is operating co-channel or on an adjacent channel, the 600 MHz band licensee must eliminate the harmful interference.

(b) A licensee authorized to operate wireless services in the 600 MHz downlink band:

(1) Is not permitted to deploy wireless base stations within the noise-limited contour or protected contour of a broadcast television station licensed on a co-channel or adjacent channel in the 600 MHz downlink band;

(2) Is required to perform an interference study using the methodology in *OET Bulletin No. 74* before deploying or operating wireless base stations within the culling distances specified in Tables 7-12 of *OET Bulletin No. 74* from the noise-limited contour or protected contour of such a broadcast television station;

(3) Is required to perform an interference study using the methodology in *OET Bulletin No. 74* when modifying a base station within the culling distances in Tables 7-12 of *OET Bulletin 74* that results in an increase in energy in the direction of co-channel or adjacent channel broadcast television station's contours;

(4) Is required to maintain records of the latest *OET Bulletin No. 74* study for each base station and make them available for inspection to the Commission and, upon a claim of harmful interference, to the requesting broadcasting television station.

(c) A licensee authorized to operate wireless services in the 600 MHz uplink band must limit its service area so that mobile and portable devices do not transmit:

(1) Co-channel or adjacent channel to a broadcast television station within that station's noise-limited contour or protected contour;

(2) Co-channel to a broadcast television station within five kilometers of that station's noise-limited contour or protected contour; and

(3) Adjacent channel to a broadcast television station within 500 meters of that station's noise-limited contour or protected contour.

(d) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

(1) Broadcast television station is defined pursuant to § 73.3700(a)(1) of this chapter;

(2) Noise-limited contour is defined to be the full power station's noise-limited contour pursuant to § 73.622(e);

(3) Protected contour is defined to be a Class A television station's protected contour as specified in section 73.6010;

(4) Co-channel operations in the 600 MHz band are defined as operations of broadcast television stations and wireless services where their assigned channels or frequencies spectrally overlap;

(5) Adjacent channel operations are defined as operations of broadcast television stations and wireless services where their assigned channels or frequencies spectrally abut each other or are separated by up to 5 MHz.
