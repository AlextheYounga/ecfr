##### § 27.1310 Protection of Broadcast Television Service in the 600 MHz band from wireless operations. #####

(a) Licensees authorized to operate wireless services in the 600 MHz band must cause no harmful interference to public reception of the signals of broadcast television stations transmitting co-channel or on an adjacent channel.

(1) Such wireless operations must comply with the D/U ratios in Table 5 in OET Bulletin No. 74, Methodology for Predicting Inter-Service Interference to Broadcast Television from Mobile Wireless Broadband Services in the UHF Band ([DATE]) (“*OET Bulletin No. 74*”). Copies of this document are available on the FCC's website. See *https://www.fcc.gov/general/oet-bulletins-line.*

(2) If a 600 MHz band licensee causes harmful interference within the noise-limited contour or protected contour of a broadcast television station that is operating co-channel or on an adjacent channel, the 600 MHz band licensee must eliminate the harmful interference.

(b) A licensee authorized to operate wireless services in the 600 MHz downlink band:

(1) Is not permitted to deploy wireless base stations within the noise-limited contour or protected contour of a broadcast television station licensed on a co-channel or adjacent channel in the 600 MHz downlink band;

(2) Is required to perform an interference study using the methodology in *OET Bulletin No. 74* before deploying or operating wireless base stations within the culling distances specified in Tables 7-12 of *OET Bulletin No. 74* from the noise-limited contour or protected contour of such a broadcast television station;

(3) Is required to perform an interference study using the methodology in *OET Bulletin No. 74* when modifying a base station within the culling distances in Tables 7-12 of *OET Bulletin 74* that results in an increase in energy in the direction of co-channel or adjacent channel broadcast television station's contours;

(4) Is required to maintain records of the latest *OET Bulletin No. 74* study for each base station and make them available for inspection to the Commission and, upon a claim of harmful interference, to the requesting broadcasting television station.

(c) A licensee authorized to operate wireless services in the 600 MHz uplink band must limit its service area so that mobile and portable devices do not transmit:

(1) Co-channel or adjacent channel to a broadcast television station within that station's noise-limited contour or protected contour;

(2) Co-channel to a broadcast television station within five kilometers of that station's noise-limited contour or protected contour; and

(3) Adjacent channel to a broadcast television station within 500 meters of that station's noise-limited contour or protected contour.

(d) For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:

(1) Broadcast television station is defined pursuant to § 73.3700(a)(1) of this chapter;

(2) Noise-limited contour is defined to be the full power station's noise-limited contour pursuant to § 73.622(e);

(3) Protected contour is defined to be a Class A television station's protected contour as specified in section 73.6010;

(4) Co-channel operations in the 600 MHz band are defined as operations of broadcast television stations and wireless services where their assigned channels or frequencies spectrally overlap;

(5) Adjacent channel operations are defined as operations of broadcast television stations and wireless services where their assigned channels or frequencies spectrally abut each other or are separated by up to 5 MHz.
