##### ยง 1000.403 How can a person or group appeal a decision or contest an action related to a program operated by a Tribe/Consortium under an AFA? #####

(a) *BIA programs.* A person or group who is aggrieved by an action of a Tribe/Consortium with respect to programs that are provided by the Tribe/Consortium under an AFA must follow Tribal administrative procedures.

(b) *Non-BIA programs.* Procedures will vary depending on the program. Aggrieved parties should initially contact the local program administrator (the Indian program contact). Thereafter, appeals will follow the relevant bureau's appeal procedures.
