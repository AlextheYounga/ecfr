Trust evaluations are normally conducted annually.

If the preliminary investigation shows that appropriate, sufficient data are present to indicate there may be imminent jeopardy, the Secretary's designated representative:

(a) Will notify the Tribe/Consortium in writing; and

(b) May conduct an on-site inspection upon 2 days' advance written notice to the Tribe/Consortium.
