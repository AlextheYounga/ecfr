##### ยง 1000.161 What is a self-governance compact? #####

A self-governance compact is an executed document that affirms the government-to-government relationship between a self-governance Tribe and the United States. The compact differs from an AFA in that parts of the compact apply to all bureaus within the Department of the Interior rather than a single bureau.
