##### ยง 1000.137 What funds are included in an AFA? #####

Bureaus determine the amount of funding to be included in the AFA using the following principles:

(a) *403(b)(2) programs.* In general, funds are provided in an AFA to the Tribe/Consortium in an amount equal to the amount that it is eligible to receive under section 106 of Pub. L. 93-638.

(b) *403(c) programs.* (1) The AFA will include:

(i) Amounts equal to the direct costs the bureau would have incurred were it to operate that program at the level of work mutually agreed to in the AFA; and

(ii) Allowable indirect costs.

(2) A bureau is not required to include management and support funds from the regional or central office level in an AFA, unless:

(i) The Tribe/Consortium will perform work previously performed at the regional or central office level;

(ii) The work is not compensated in the indirect cost rate; and

(iii) Including management and support costs in the AFA does not result in the Tribe/Consortium being paid twice for the same work when negotiated indirect cost rate is applied.

(c) *Funding Limitations.* The amount of funding must be subject to the availability and level of Congressional appropriations to the bureau for that program or activity. As the various bureaus use somewhat differing budgeting practices, determining the amount of funds available for inclusion in the AFA for a particular program or activity is likely to vary among bureaus or programs.

(1) The AFA may not exceed the amount of funding the bureau would have spent for direct operations and indirect support and management of that program in that year.

(2) The AFA must not include funding for programs still performed by the bureau.
