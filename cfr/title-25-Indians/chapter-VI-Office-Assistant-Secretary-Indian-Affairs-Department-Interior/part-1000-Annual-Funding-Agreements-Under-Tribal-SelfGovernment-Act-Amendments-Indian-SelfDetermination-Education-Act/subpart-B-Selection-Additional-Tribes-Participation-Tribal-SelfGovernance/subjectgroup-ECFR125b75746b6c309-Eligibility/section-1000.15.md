##### § 1000.15 How many additional Tribes/Consortia may participate in self-governance per year? #####

(a) Sections 402(b) and (c) of the Act authorize the Director to select up to 50 additional Indian Tribes per year from an “applicant pool”. A Consortium of Indian Tribes counts as one Tribe for purposes of calculating the 50 additional Tribes per year.

(b) Any signatory Tribe that signed a compact and AFA under the Tribal Self-Governance Demonstration project may negotiate its own compact and AFA in accordance with this subpart without being counted against the 50-Tribe limitation in any given year.
