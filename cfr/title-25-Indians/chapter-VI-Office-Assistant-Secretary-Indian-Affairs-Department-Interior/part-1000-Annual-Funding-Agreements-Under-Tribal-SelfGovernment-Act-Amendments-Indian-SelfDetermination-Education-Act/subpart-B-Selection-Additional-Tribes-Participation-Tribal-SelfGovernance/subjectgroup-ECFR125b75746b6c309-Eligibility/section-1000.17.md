##### § 1000.17 What documents must a Tribe/Consortium submit to OSG to apply for admission to the applicant pool? #####

In addition to the application required by § 1000.23, the Tribe/Consortium must submit to OSG documentation that shows all of the following:

(a) *Successful completion of a planning phase and a planning report.* The requirements for both of these are described in § 1000.19 and § 1000.20. A Consortium's planning activities satisfy this requirement for all its member Tribes for the purpose of the Consortium meeting this requirement;

(b) *A request for participation in self-governance by a Tribal resolution and/or a final official action by the Tribal governing body.* For a Consortium, the governing body of each Tribe must authorize its participation by a Tribal resolution and/or a final official action by the Tribal governing body that specifies the scope of the Consortium's authority to act on behalf of the Tribe.

(c) *A demonstration of financial stability and financial management capability for the previous 3 fiscal years.* This will be done by providing, as part of the application, an audit report prepared in accordance with procedures promulgated under the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996, 31 U.S.C. 7501, *et seq.,* for the previous 3 years of the self-determination contracts. These audits must not contain material audit exceptions as defined in § 1000.21.
