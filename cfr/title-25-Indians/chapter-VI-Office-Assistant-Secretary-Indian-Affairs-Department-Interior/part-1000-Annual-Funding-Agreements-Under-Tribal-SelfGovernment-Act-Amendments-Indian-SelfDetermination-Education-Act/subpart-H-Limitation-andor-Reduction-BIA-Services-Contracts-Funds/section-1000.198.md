(a) If funding a participating Tribe/Consortium will limit or reduce services, contracts, or funds for which another Tribe/Consortium or Tribal organization is eligible, BIA must remedy the reduction as follows:

(2) In a subsequent AFA year, BIA may adjust the AFA funding in an AFA to correct a finding of actual reduction in services, contracts, or funds for that subsequent year.

(b) All adjustments under this section must be mutually agreed between BIA and the participating Tribe/Consortium.
