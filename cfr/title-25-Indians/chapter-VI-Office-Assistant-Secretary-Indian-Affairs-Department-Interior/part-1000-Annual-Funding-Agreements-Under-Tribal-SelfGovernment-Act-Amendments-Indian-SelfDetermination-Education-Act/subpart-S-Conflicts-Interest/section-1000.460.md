(1) The financial interests of beneficial owners of Indian trust resources;

(2) The financial interests of the United States relating to trust resources, trust acquisitions, or lands conveyed or to be conveyed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act 43 U.S. C. 1601 *et seq.;* or

(3) An express statutory obligation of the United States to third parties. This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the AFA was first negotiated.

(b) This section only applies where the financial interests of the Tribe/Consortium are significant enough to impair the Tribe's/Consortium's objectivity in carrying out the AFA, or a portion of the AFA.
