##### ยง 1000.461 What must a Tribe/Consortium do if an organizational conflict of interest arises under an AFA? #####

This section only applies if the conflict was not addressed when the AFA was first negotiated. When a Tribe/Consortium becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest, the Tribe/Consortium must immediately disclose the conflict to the Secretary.
