(Secs. 1, 3, 36 Stat. 270, 272, as amended; 25 U.S.C. 385. Interprets or applies sec. 1, 41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386)[22 FR 10566, Dec. 24, 1957. Redesignated at 47 FR 13327, Mar. 30, 1982]Note:

On May 12, 1921, Circular No. 1677, re sale of irrigable lands, was addressed to all superintendents. It was pointed out therein that the collection of irrigation construction charges was required by the terms of an act approved February 14, 1920 (41 Stat. 409; 25 U.S.C. 386), and that in addition to the construction charge there was an operation and maintenance charge assessable annually that must be paid by the landowners benefited; furthermore, that the purpose of this circular was to point out to the superintendents the necessity of advising prospective purchasers that irrigation charges must be paid and that a so-called paid-up water right was not conveyed with the land. A form of agreement to be executed by the prospective purchaser accompanied this circular.

It has been brought to the attention of the Bureau that irrigation construction charges and operation and maintenance charges have accrued against irrigable allotments prior to the time of their being advertised for sale and that the superintendents have failed to provide for payment of the accrued irrigation charges, with the result that no means are apparent for their collection.

With a view of preventing any future misunderstanding the form of contract accompanying Circular No. 1677 has been redrafted and Form 5-462b assigned to it. The circular has been designated “No. 1677a.”
