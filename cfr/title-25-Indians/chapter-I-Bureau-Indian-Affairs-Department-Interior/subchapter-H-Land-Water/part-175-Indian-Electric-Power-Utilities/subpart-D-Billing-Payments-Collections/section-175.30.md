(a) *Metered customers.* The utility shall render bills at monthly intervals unless otherwise provided in special contracts. Bills shall be based on the applicable rate schedule(s). Unless otherwise determined, the amount of energy and/or power demand used by the customer shall be as determined from the register on the utility's meter at the customer's point of delivery.
