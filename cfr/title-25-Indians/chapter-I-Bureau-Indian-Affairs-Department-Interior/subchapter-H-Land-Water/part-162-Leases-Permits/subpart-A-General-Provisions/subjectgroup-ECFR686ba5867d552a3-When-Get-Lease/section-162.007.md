##### § 162.007 To what permits does this part apply? #####

(a) Permits for the use of Indian land do not require our approval; however, you must fulfill the following requirements:

(1) Ensure that permitted activities comply with all applicable environmental and cultural resource laws; and

(2) Submit all permits to the appropriate BIA office to allow us to maintain a copy of the permit in our records. If we determine within 10 days of submission that the document does not meet the definition of “permit” and grants a legal interest in Indian land, we will notify you that a lease is required.

(b) The following table provides examples of some common characteristics of permits versus leases.
