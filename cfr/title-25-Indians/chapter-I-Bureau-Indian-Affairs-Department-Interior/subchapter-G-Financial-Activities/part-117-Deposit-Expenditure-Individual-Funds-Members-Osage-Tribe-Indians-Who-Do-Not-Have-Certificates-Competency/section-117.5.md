##### § 117.5 Procedure for hearings to assume supervision of expenditure of allowance funds. #####

(a) Whenever the superintendent has reason to believe that an adult Indian is wasting or squandering his allowance funds the superintendent may cause an investigation and written report of the facts to be made. If the report indicates that the Indian is wasting or squandering his allowance funds the following notice shall be served upon the Indian, in person or by registered mail, and a copy thereof shall likewise be served upon his guardian if the Indian is under guardianship:

Section 1 of the act of February 27, 1925 (43 Stat. 1008) provides in part as follows:

“All payments to adults not having certificates of competency, including amounts paid for each minor, shall, in case the Secretary of the Interior finds that such adults are wasting or squandering said income, be subject to the supervision of the Superintendent of the Osage Agency: . . .”

Enclosed is a copy of a report which has been made to me concerning your handling and management of the income paid to you through the Osage Agency. This report indicates that you have been wasting and squandering your payments.

You are hereby notified that a hearing will be held in the Osage Indian Agency, Pawhuska, Oklahoma, at \_\_\_\_ m., on the \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ day of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, 19\_\_\_\_, before the Superintendent, for the purpose of taking testimony and evidence to be submitted to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for his consideration in determining whether your payments shall be subject to the supervision of the Superintendent.

You are requested to be present at the hearing at the time and place designated above. You may introduce at the hearing such testimony and evidence as you deem appropriate to show that you are not wasting or squandering your payments and that your payments should continue to be made to you without supervision for your unrestricted use.

You are entitled to employ an attorney to assist you in this matter. Upon your request the employees of the Osage Agency will furnish you with any information you desire concerning your accounts at the Osage Agency or any of your transactions handled through the Osage Agency.

Date.

Superintendent.

(b) A hearing shall be held pursuant to the notice, the date of which shall be not less than 30 days after the date of the notice. For good cause shown to exist the superintendent may continue the hearing to a later date.

(c) A record of the proceedings, consisting of the superintendent's preliminary report, the notice and proof of service, all testimony and evidence introduced at the hearing, and all briefs and letters filed by the Indian or his attorney shall be submitted to the Commissioner, together with a recommendation from the superintendent.

(d) Upon a finding by the Commissioner that the Indian is wasting or squandering his income, his allowance funds shall thereafter be subject to the supervision of the superintendent. Notice of the decision of the Commissioner shall be furnished all interested parties.
