Only members of the Osage Tribe who will be eighteen years of age or over on election day and whose names appear on the quarterly annuity roll at the Osage Agency as of the last quarterly payment immediately preceding the date of election will be entitled to hold office or vote for any tribal officers. Each such voter shall be entitled to cast one ballot and each ballot shall have exactly the same value as the voter's headright interest shown on the last quarterly annuity roll. Any fraction of a headright, however, shall be valued as to the first two decimals only unless such interest is less than one-hundredth of a share, then it shall have its full value.
