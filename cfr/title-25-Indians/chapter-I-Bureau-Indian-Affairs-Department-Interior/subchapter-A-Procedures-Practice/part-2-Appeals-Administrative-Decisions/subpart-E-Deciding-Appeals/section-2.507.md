##### § 2.507 How do I appeal a reviewing official's decision? #####

(a) To appeal a reviewing official's decision that is not a final agency action, you must file your appeal in accordance with the instructions for appeal contained in the decision.

(b) The decision will include instructions that briefly describe how to appeal the decision, to whom the appeal should be directed, and the deadline for filing an appeal, and will refer interested parties to the regulations governing the appeal.

(c) If you are appealing to the IBIA, you must comply with IBIA's regulations, set out at 43 CFR part 4.

(d) Except where a specific section of this part sets out a different appellate hierarchy, table 1 to this paragraph (d) indicates the official to whom subsequent appeals should be addressed.
