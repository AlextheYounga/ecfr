##### ยง 30.125 What happens if a State refuses to allow a school access to the State assessment? #####

(a) The Department will work directly with State officials to assist schools in obtaining access to the State's assessment. This can include direct communication with the Governor of the State. A Bureau-funded school may, if necessary, pay a State for access to its assessment tools and scoring services.

(b) If a State does not provide access to the State's assessment, the Bureau-funded school must submit a waiver for an alternative definition of AYP.
