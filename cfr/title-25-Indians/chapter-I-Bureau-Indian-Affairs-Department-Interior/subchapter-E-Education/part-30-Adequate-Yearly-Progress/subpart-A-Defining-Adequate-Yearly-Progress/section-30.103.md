##### ยง 30.103 Did the Committee consider a separate Bureau definition of AYP? #####

Yes, the Committee considered having the Bureau of Indian Affairs develop a separate Bureau definition of AYP. For a variety of reasons, the Committee reached consensus on the definition in ยง 30.104. This definition is in no way intended to diminish the United States' trust responsibility for Indian education nor is it intended to give States authority over Bureau-funded schools.
