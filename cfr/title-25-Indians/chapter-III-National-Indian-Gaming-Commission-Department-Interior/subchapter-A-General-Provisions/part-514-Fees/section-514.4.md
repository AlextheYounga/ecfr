##### § 514.4 What are “assessable gross revenues” and how does a tribe calculate the amount of the annual fee it owes? #####

(a) For purposes of computing fees, assessable gross revenues for each gaming operation are the annual total amount of money wagered on class II and III games, entry fees (including table or card fees), less any amounts paid out as prizes or paid for prizes awarded, and less an allowance for amortization of capital expenditures for structures as reflected in the gaming operation's audited financial statements.

(1) An amount not to exceed 5% of the cost of structures in use throughout the year and 2.5% of the cost of structures in use during only a part of the year; or

(2) An amount not to exceed 10% of the total amount of depreciation expenses for the year.

(e) All class II and III revenues from gaming operations are to be included.
