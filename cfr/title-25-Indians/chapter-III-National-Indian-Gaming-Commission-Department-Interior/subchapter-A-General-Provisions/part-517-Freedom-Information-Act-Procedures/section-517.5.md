##### ยง 517.5 Responsibility for responding to requests. #####

(a) *In general.* In determining which records are responsive to a request, the Commission ordinarily will include only records in its possession as of the date it begins its search for records. If any other date is used, the FOIA Officer shall inform the requester of that date.

(b) *Authority to grant or deny requests.* The FOIA Officer shall make initial determinations either to grant or deny in whole or in part a request for records.

(c) *Consultations and referrals.* (1) When a requested record has been created by another Federal Government agency that record shall be referred to the originating agency for direct response to the requester. The requester shall be informed of the referral. As this is not a denial of a FOIA request, no appeal rights accrue to the requester.

(2) When a requested record is identified as containing information originating with another Federal Government agency, the record shall be referred to the originating agency for review and recommendation on disclosure.
