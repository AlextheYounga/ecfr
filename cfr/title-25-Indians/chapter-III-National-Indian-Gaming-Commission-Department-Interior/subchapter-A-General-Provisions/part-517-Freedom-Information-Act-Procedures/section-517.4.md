##### ยง 517.4 Requirements for making requests. #####

(a) *How to make a FOIA request.* Requests for records made pursuant to the FOIA must be in writing. Requests should be sent to the National Indian Gaming Commission, Attn: FOIA Officer, C/O Department of Interior, 1849 C Street NW., Mailstop #1621, Washington, DC 20240. If the requester is making a request for records about himself/herself, the requester should see 25 CFR 515.3 for additional information. If the requester is making a request for records about another individual, the requester must provide either a written authorization signed by that individual authorizing disclosure of the records to the requester or provide proof that the individual is deceased (for example, a copy of the death certificate or a copy of the obituary).

(b) *Description of records sought.* Requests for records shall describe the records requested with as much specificity as possible to enable Commission employees to locate the information requested with a reasonable amount of effort.

(c) *Agreement to pay fees.* Requests shall also include a statement indicating the maximum amount of fees the requester is willing to pay to obtain the requested information, or a request for a waiver or reduction of fees. If the requester is requesting a waiver or reduction of fees the requester must include justification for such waiver or reduction (see Sec. 517.9 (c) for more information). If the request for a fee waiver is denied, the requester will be notified of this decision and advised that fees associated with the processing of the request will be assessed. The requester must send an acknowledgment to the FOIA Officer indicating his/her willingness to pay the fees. Absent such acknowledgment within the specified time frame, the request will be considered incomplete, no further work shall be done, and the request will be administratively closed.

(d) *Types of records not available.* The FOIA does not require the Commission to:

(1) Compile or create records solely for the purpose of satisfying a request for records;

(2) Provide records not yet in existence, even if such records may be expected to come into existence at some future time; or

(3) Restore records destroyed or otherwise disposed of, except that the FOIA Officer must notify the requester that the requested records have been destroyed or disposed.
