##### ยง 111.74 Decision and notice of suspension or revocation or monetary penalty. #####

If the Secretary of Homeland Security, or his designee, finds that one or more of the charges in the statement of charges is not sufficiently proved, he may base a suspension, revocation, or monetary penalty action on any remaining charges if the facts alleged in the charges are established by the evidence. If the Secretary of Homeland Security, or his designee, in the exercise of his discretion and based solely on the record, issues an order suspending a broker's license or permit for a specified period of time or revoking a broker's license or permit or, except in a case described in ยง 111.53(b)(3), assessing a monetary penalty in lieu of suspension or revocation, the Assistant Commissioner will promptly provide written notification of the order to the broker and, unless an appeal from the Secretary's order is filed by the broker (see ยง 111.75), the Assistant Commissioner will publish a notice of the suspension or revocation, or the assessment of a monetary penalty, in the Federal Register and in the Customs Bulletin. If no appeal from the Secretary's order is filed, an order of suspension or revocation or assessment of a monetary penalty will become effective 60 calendar days after issuance of written notification of the order unless the Secretary finds that a more immediate effective date is in the national or public interest. If a monetary penalty is assessed and no appeal from the Secretary's order is filed, payment of the penalty must be tendered within 60 calendar days after the effective date of the order, and, if payment is not tendered within that 60-day period, the license or permit of the broker will immediately be suspended until payment is made.
