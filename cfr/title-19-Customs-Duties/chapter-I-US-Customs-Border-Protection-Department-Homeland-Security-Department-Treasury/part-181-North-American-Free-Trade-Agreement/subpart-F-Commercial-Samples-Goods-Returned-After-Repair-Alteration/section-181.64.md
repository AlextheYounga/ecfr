##### § 181.64 Goods re-entered after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico. #####

(a) *General.* This section sets forth the rules which apply for purposes of obtaining duty-free or reduced-duty treatment on goods returned after repair or alteration in Canada or Mexico as provided for in subheadings 9802.00.40 and 9802.00.50, HTSUS. Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Mexico, whether or not pursuant to a warranty, and goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada pursuant to a warranty, are eligible for duty-free treatment, provided that the requirements of this section are met. Goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty are subject to duty upon the value of the repairs or alterations using the applicable duty rate under the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement (see § 10.301 of this chapter), provided that the requirements of this section are met. For purposes of this section, “repairs or alterations” means restoration, addition, renovation, redyeing, cleaning, resterilizing, or other treatment which does not destroy the essential characteristics of, or create a new or commercially different good from, the good exported from the United States.

Example.Glass mugs produced in the United States are exported to Canada for etching and tempering operations, after which they are returned to the United States for sale. The foreign operations exceed the scope of an alteration because they are manufacturing processes which create commercially different products with distinct new characteristics.

(b) *Goods not eligible for duty-free or reduced-duty treatment after repair or alteration.* The duty-free or reduced-duty treatment referred to in paragraph (a) of this section shall not apply to goods which, in their condition as exported from the United States to Canada or Mexico, are incomplete for their intended use and for which the processing operation performed in Canada or Mexico constitutes an operation that is performed as a matter of course in the preparation or manufacture of finished goods.

Example.Unflanged metal wheel rims are exported to Canada for a flanging operation to strengthen them so as to conform to U.S. Army specifications for wheel rims; although the goods when exported from the United States are dedicated for use in the making of wheel rims, they cannot be used for that purpose until flanged. The flanging operation does not constitute a repair or alteration because that operation is necessary for the completion of the wheel rims.

(c) *Documentation* - (1) *Declarations required.* Except as otherwise provided in this section, the following declarations shall be filed in connection with the entry of goods which are returned from Canada or Mexico after having been exported for repairs or alterations and which are claimed to be duty free or subject to duty only on the value of the repairs or alterations performed abroad:

(i) A declaration from the person who performed such repairs or alterations, in substantially the following form:

(2) *Additional documentation.* The Center director may require such additional documentation as is deemed necessary to prove actual exportation of the goods from the United States for repairs or alterations, such as a foreign customs entry, a foreign customs invoice, a foreign landing certificate, bill of lading, or airway bill.

(3) *Waiver of declarations.* If the Center director concerned is satisfied, because of the nature of the goods or production of other evidence, that the goods are imported under circumstances meeting the requirements of this section, he may waive submission of the declarations provided for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(4) *Deposit of estimated duties to CBP, either at the port of entry or electronically.* For goods returned after having been repaired or altered in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty, the port director shall require a deposit of estimated duties based upon the full cost or value of the repairs or alterations. The cost or value of the repairs or alterations performed in Canada other than pursuant to a warranty, which is to be set forth in the invoice and entry papers as the basis for the assessment of duty for such goods, shall be limited to the cost or value of the repairs or alterations actually performed in Canada, which shall include all domestic and foreign articles furnished for the repairs or alterations but shall not include any of the expenses incurred in the United States whether by way of engineering costs, preparation of plans or specifications, furnishing of tools or equipment for doing the repairs or alterations in Canada, or otherwise.
