Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 93014, Dec. 20, 2016.

(a) Textile fiber products imported into the United States shall be labeled or marked in accordance with the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act (15 U.S.C. 70 through 70k) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR part 303) unless exempt from marking or labeling under section 12 of the Act (15 U.S.C. 70i). An invoice or other paper, containing the specified information may be used in lieu of a label where the textile product is not in the form intended for sale, delivery to, or for use by the ultimate consumer. Rule 31 of the Federal Trade Commission (16 CFR 303.31).

(b) If imported fiber products are not correctly labeled and the port director is satisfied that the error or omission involved no fraud or willful neglect, the importer shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to label the merchandise under customs supervision to conform with the requirements of such Act and the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission. The compensation and expenses of Customs officers and employees assigned to supervise the labeling shall be reimbursed to the Government and shall be assessed in the same manner as in the case of marking of country of origin, § 134.55 of this chapter.

(c) Packages of fiber products subject to the provisions of this section which are not designated for examination may be released pending examination of the designated packages, but only if there shall have been filed in connection with the entry bonds on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 and/or § 113.68 of this chapter, as appropriate, in such amount as the port director may require.

(d) The port director shall give written notice to the importer of any lack of compliance with the Fiber Products Identification Act in respect of an importation of fiber products, and pursuant to § 141.113 of this chapter shall demand the immediate return of the involved products to customs custody, unless the lack of compliance is forthwith corrected.

(e) If the products covered by a notice and demand given pursuant to the preceding paragraph are not promptly returned to Customs custody and the port director is not fully satisfied that they have been brought into compliance with the Fiber Products Identification Act, appropriate action shall be taken to effect the collection of liquidated damages in an amount equal to the entered value of the merchandise not redelivered, plus the estimated duty thereon as determined at the time of entry, unless the owner or consignee shall file with the appropriate Customs officer an application for cancellation of the liability incurred under the bond upon the payment as liquidated damages of a lesser amount than the full amount of the liquidated damages incurred, or upon the basis of such other terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may deem sufficient. The application shall contain a full statement of the reasons for the requested cancellation and shall be in duplicate.

(f) If any willful or flagrant violation of the Act with respect to the importation of articles comes to the attention of a port director, the involved merchandise shall be placed under seizure, or a demand shall be made for the redelivery of the merchandise if it has been released from Customs custody, and the case shall be reported to the Federal Trade Commission, Washington DC 20580.
