##### ยง 191.81 Liquidation. #####

(a) *Time of liquidation.* Drawback entries may be liquidated after:

(1) Liquidation of the import entry becomes final; or

(2) Deposit of estimated duties on the imported merchandise and before liquidation of the import entry.

(b) *Claims based on estimated duties.* (1) Drawback may be paid on estimated duties if the import entry has not been liquidated, or the liquidation has not become final (because of a protest being filed) (see also ยง 173.4(c) of this chapter), and the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of liquidated import duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim, waiving any right to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the estimated duties on the unliquidated import entry are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on estimated duties is requested under this paragraph. The drawback claimant shall, to the best of its knowledge, identify each import entry that has been protested or that is the subject of a request for reliquidation (19 U.S.C. 1520(c)(1)) and that is included in the drawback claim. A drawback entry, once finally liquidated on the basis of estimated duties, shall not be adjusted by reason of a subsequent final liquidation of the import entry.

(2) However, if final liquidation of the import entry discloses that the total amount of import duty is different from the total estimated duties deposited, except in those cases when drawback is 100% of the duty, the party responsible for the payment of liquidated duties, as applicable, shall:

(i) Be liable for 1 percent of all increased duties found to be due on that portion of merchandise recorded on the drawback entry; or

(ii) Be entitled to a refund of 1 percent of all excess duties found to be paid on that portion of the merchandise recorded on the drawback entry.

(c) *Claims based on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties* - (1) *General.* Subject to the requirements in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, drawback may be paid on voluntary tenders of the unpaid amount of lawful ordinary Customs duties or any other payment of lawful ordinary Customs duties for an entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption (see ยง 191.3(a)(1)(iii) of this part), provided that:

(i) The tender or payment is specifically identified as duty on a specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption;

(ii) Liquidation of the specifically identified entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption became final prior to such tender or payment; and

(iii) Liquidation of the drawback entry in which that specifically identified import entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption is designated has not become final.

(2) *Written request and waiver.* Drawback may be paid on claims based on voluntary tenders or other payments of duties under this subsection only if the drawback claimant and any other party responsible for the payment of the voluntary tenders or other payments of duties each files a written request for payment of each drawback claim based on such voluntary tenders or other payments of duties, waiving any claim to payment or refund under other provisions of law, to the extent that the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties under this paragraph are included in the drawback claim for which drawback on the voluntary tenders or other payment of duties is requested under this paragraph.

(d) *Claims based on liquidated duties.* Drawback shall be based on the final liquidated duties paid that have been made final by operation of law (except in the case of the written request for payment of drawback on the basis of estimated duties, voluntary tender of duties, and other payments of duty, and waiver, provided for in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section).

(e) *Liquidation procedure.* When the drawback claim has been completed by the filing of the entry and other required documents, and exportation (or destruction) of the articles has been established, the drawback office shall determine drawback due on the basis of the complete drawback claim, the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or specific manufacturing drawback ruling, and any other relevant evidence or information.

(f) *Relative value; multiple products* - (1) *Distribution.* Where two or more products result from the manufacture or production of merchandise, drawback shall be distributed to the several products in accordance with their relative value at the time of separation.

(2) *Value.* The value to be used in computing the distribution of drawback where two or more products result from the manufacture or production of merchandise under drawback conditions shall be the market value (see ยง 191.2(u) of this part), unless another value is approved by Customs.

(g) *Payment.* The drawback office shall authorize the amount of the refund due as drawback to the claimant.
