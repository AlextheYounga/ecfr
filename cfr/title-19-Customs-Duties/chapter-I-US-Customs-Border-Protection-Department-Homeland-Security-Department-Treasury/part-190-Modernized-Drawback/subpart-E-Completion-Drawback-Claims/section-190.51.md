The undersigned acknowledges that a false certification of the foregoing renders the drawback claim incomplete and subject to denial. The undersigned is fully aware of the sanctions provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001, and 18 U.S.C. 550, and 19 U.S.C. 1593a.”

(3) *Election of line item designation for imported merchandise.* Merchandise on a specific line on an entry summary may be designated for either direct identification or substitution claims but a single line on an entry summary may not be split for purposes of claiming drawback under both direct identification and substitution claims. The first complete drawback claim accepted by CBP which designates merchandise on a line on an entry summary establishes this designation for any remaining merchandise on that same line.

(4) *Limitation on line item eligibility for imported merchandise.* Claimants filing substitution drawback claims under part 190 for imported merchandise associated with a line item on an entry summary if any other merchandise covered on that entry summary has been designated as the basis of a claim under part 191 must provide additional information enabling CBP to verify the availability of drawback for the indicated merchandise and associated line item within 30 days of claim submission. The information to be provided will include, but is not limited to: summary document specifying the lines used and unused on the import entry; the import entry summary, corresponding commercial invoices, and copies of all drawback claims that previously designated the import entry summary; and post summary/liquidation changes (for imports or drawback claims, if applicable).

(b) *Drawback due*—(1) *Claimant required to calculate drawback.* Drawback claimants are required to correctly calculate the amount of drawback due. The amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry is generally to be 99 percent of the duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback. (For example, if $1,000 in import duties are eligible for drawback less 1 percent ($10), the amount claimed on the drawback entry should be for $990.) Claims exceeding 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will not be paid until the calculations have been corrected by the claimant. Claims for less than 99 percent (or 100% when 100% of the duty is available for drawback) will be paid as filed, unless the claimant amends the claim in accordance with § 190.52(c). The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback is determined by whether a claim is based upon direct identification or substitution, as provided for below:

(i) *Direct identification.* The amounts eligible for drawback for a unit of merchandise consists of those duties, taxes, and fees that were paid for that unit of the designated imported merchandise. This may be the amount of duties, taxes, and fees actually tendered on that unit or those attributable to that unit, if identified pursuant to an approved accounting method (*see* 19 CFR 190.14).

(ii) *Substitution.* The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) or 19 U.S.C. 1313(j)(2) is determined by per unit averaging, as defined in § 190.2. The amount that may be refunded is also subject to the limitations set forth in § 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and § 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.

(2) *Merchandise processing fee apportionment calculation.* Where a drawback claimant requests a refund of a merchandise processing fee paid pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(A), the claimant is required to correctly apportion the fee to that imported merchandise for which drawback is claimed when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry. This is determined as follows:

(i) Relative value ratio for each line item. The value of each line item of entered merchandise subject to a merchandise processing fee is calculated (to four decimal places) by dividing the value of the line item subject to the fee by the total value of entered merchandise subject to the fee. The result is the relative value ratio.

(ii) Merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item. To apportion the merchandise processing fee to each line item, the relative value ratio for each line item is multiplied by the merchandise processing fee paid.

(iii) Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per line item. The amount of merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item is multiplied by 99 percent to calculate that portion of the fee attributable to each line item that is eligible for drawback.

(iv) Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise. To calculate the amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise, the line item amount that is eligible for drawback is divided by the number of units covered by that line item (to two decimal places).

(v) Limitation on amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for substitution claims. The amount of a merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise for drawback claims based upon substitution is subject to the limitations set forth in §§ 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.

Example 1:Line item 1—5,000 articles valued at $10 each total $50,000Line item 2—6,000 articles valued at $15 each total $90,000Line item 3—10,000 articles valued at $20 each total $200,000Total units = 21,000Total value = $340,000Merchandise processing fee = $485 (for purposes of this example, the fee cap of $485 is assumed; see 19 CFR 24.23 for the current amount consistent with 19 U.S.C. 58c(a)(9)(B)(i)).

*Line item relative value ratios.* The relative value ratio for line item 1 is calculated by dividing the value of that line item by the total value ($50,000 ÷ 340,000 = .1471). The relative value ratio for line item 2 is .2647. The relative value ratio for line item 3 is .5882.

*Merchandise processing fee apportioned to each line item.* The amount of fee attributable to each line item is calculated by multiplying $485 by the applicable relative value ratio. The amount of the $485 fee attributable to line item 1 is $71.3435 (.1471 × $485 = $71.3435). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 2 is $128.3795 (.2647 × $485 = $128.3795). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 3 is $285.2770 (.5882 × $485 = $285.2770).

*Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per line item.* The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for line item 1 is $70.6301 (.99 × $71.3435). The amount of fee eligible for drawback for line item 2 is $127.0957 (.99 × $128.3795). The amount of fee eligible for drawback for line item 3 is $282.4242 (.99 × $285.2770).

*Amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise.* The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise is calculated by dividing the amount of fee eligible for drawback for the line item by the number of units in the line item. For line item 1, the amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0141 ($70.6301 ÷ 5,000 = $.0141). If 1,000 widgets form the basis of a claim for drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(j), the total amount of drawback attributable to the merchandise processing fee is $14.10 (1,000 × .0141 = $14.10). For line item 2, the amount of fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0212 ($127.0957 ÷ 6,000 = $.0212). For line item 3, the amount of fee eligible for drawback per unit is $.0282 ($282.4242 ÷ 10,000 = $.0282).

Example 2.This example illustrates the treatment of dutiable merchandise that is exempt from the merchandise processing fee and duty-free merchandise that is subject to the merchandise processing fee.Line item 1—700 meters of printed cloth valued at $10 per meter (total value $7,000) that is exempt from the merchandise processing fee under 19 U.S.C. 58c(b)(8)(B)(iii)Line item 2—15,000 articles valued at $100 each (total value $1,500,000)Line item 3—10,000 duty-free articles valued at $50 each (total value $500,000)

The relative value ratios are calculated using line items 2 and 3 only, as there is no merchandise processing fee imposed by reason of importation on line item 1.

Line item 2—1,500,000 ÷ 2,000,000 = .75 (line items 2 and 3 form the total value of the merchandise subject to the merchandise processing fee).Line item 3—500,000 ÷ 2,000,000 = .25.

If the total merchandise processing fee paid was $485, the amount of the fee attributable to line item 2 is $363.75 (.75 × $485 = $363.75). The amount of the fee attributable to line item 3 is $121.25 (.25 × $485 = $121.25).

The amount of merchandise processing fee eligible for drawback for line item 2 is $360.1125 (.99 × $363.75). The amount of fee eligible for line item 3 is $120.0375 (.99 × $121.25).

The amount of drawback on the merchandise processing fee attributable to each unit of line item 2 is $.0240 ($360.1125 ÷ 15,000 = $.0240). The amount of drawback on the merchandise processing fee attributable to each unit of line item 3 is $.0120 ($120.0375 ÷ 10,000 = $.0120).

If 1,000 units of line item 2 were exported, the drawback attributable to the merchandise processing fee is $24.00 ($.0240 × 1,000 = $24.00).

(3) *Calculations for all other duties, taxes, and fees*—(i) *General.* Where a drawback claimant requests a refund of any other duties, taxes, and fees allowable in accordance with § 190.3, the claimant is required to accurately calculate (including apportionment using per unit averaging or inventory management methods, as appropriate) the duties, taxes, and fees attributable to the designated imported merchandise for which drawback is being claimed when calculating the amount of drawback requested on the drawback entry (generally 99% of the duties, taxes, and fees paid on the imported merchandise).

(ii) *Examples.* As illustrated in the examples in this paragraph, in the case of customs duties, the type of calculation required to determine the amount of duties available for refund (generally 99% of the duties paid on the imported merchandise) will vary depending on whether the duty involved is ad valorem, specific, or compound.

Example 1: Ad valorem duty rate.Apportionment of the duties paid (and available for refund) will be based on the application of the duty rates to the per unit values of the imported merchandise. The per unit values are based on the invoice values unless the method of refund calculation is per unit averaging, which would require equal apportionment of the duties paid over the quantity of imported merchandise covered by the line item upon which the imported merchandise was reported on the import entry summary. As a result, the amount of duties available for refund will vary depending on the method used to calculate refunds.Example 2: Specific duty rate.No apportionment of the duties paid is required to determine the amount available for refund. A fixed duty rate is applicable to each unit of the imported merchandise based on quantity. This fixed rate will not vary based on the per unit values of the imported merchandise and, as a result, there is no impact on the amount of duties available for refunds (regardless of whether the refunds are calculated based on invoice values or per unit averaging).Example 3: Compound duty rate.A compound duty rate is a combination of an ad valorem duty rate and a specific duty rate, with both rates applied to the same imported merchandise. As a result, a combination of the calculations discussed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will apply when calculating the amount of duties paid that are available for refund.

(4) *Limitation.* The amount of duties, taxes, and fees eligible for drawback per unit of merchandise for drawback claims based upon substituted merchandise is subject to the limitations set forth in § 190.22(a)(1)(ii) (manufacturing claims) and § 190.32(b) (unused merchandise claims), as applicable.

(c) *HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number*(*s)*—(1) *General.* Drawback claimants are required to provide, on all drawback claims they submit, the 10-digit HTSUS classification or the Schedule B commodity number(s), for the following:

(i) *Designated imported merchandise.* For imported merchandise designated on drawback claims, the HTSUS classification applicable at the time of entry (e.g., as required to be reported on the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation).

(ii) *Substituted merchandise on manufacturing claims.* For merchandise substituted on manufacturing drawback claims, and consistent with the applicable general manufacturing drawback ruling or the specific manufacturing drawback ruling, the applicable HTSUS classification numbers must be the same as either—

(A) If the substituted merchandise was imported, the HTSUS classification applicable at the time of entry (e.g., as required to be reported on the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation); or,

(B) If the substituted merchandise was not imported, the HTSUS classification that would have been reported to CBP for the applicable entry summary(s) and other entry documentation, for the domestically produced substituted merchandise, at the time of entry of the designated imported merchandise.

(iii) *Exported merchandise or articles.* For exported merchandise or articles, the HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number(s) must be from the Electronic Export Information (EEI), when required. If no EEI is required (*see,* 15 CFR part 30 subpart D for a complete list of exemptions), then the claimant must provide the Schedule B commodity number(s) or HTSUS number(s) that the exporter would have set forth on the EEI when the exportation took place, but for the exemption from the requirement for an EEI.

(iv) *Destroyed merchandise or articles.* For destroyed merchandise or articles, the HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number(s) must be reported, subject to the following:

(A) if the HTSUS classification is reported, then it must be the HTSUS classification that would have been applicable to the destroyed merchandise or articles if they had been entered for consumption at the time of destruction; or

(B) if the Schedule B commodity number is reported, then it must be the Schedule B commodity number that would have been reported for the destroyed merchandise or articles if the EEI had been required for an exportation at the time of destruction.

(2) *Changes to classification.* If the 10-digit HTSUS classification or the Schedule B commodity number(s) reported to CBP for the drawback claim are determined to be incorrect or otherwise in controversy after the filing of the drawback entry, then the claimant must notify the drawback office where the drawback claim was filed of the correct HTSUS classification or Schedule B commodity number or the nature of the controversy before the liquidation of the drawback entry.

(d) *Method of filing.* All drawback claims must be submitted through a CBP-authorized system.

(e) *Time of filing*—(1) *General.* A complete drawback claim is timely filed if it is successfully transmitted not later than 5 years after the date on which the merchandise designated as the basis for the drawback claim was imported and in compliance with all other applicable deadlines under this part.

(i) *Official date of filing.* The official date of filing is the date upon which CBP receives a complete claim, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, via transmission through a CBP-authorized system, including the uploading of all required supporting documentation.

(ii) *Abandonment.* Claims not completed within the 5-year period after the date on which the merchandise designated as the basis for the drawback claim was imported will be considered abandoned. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, no extension will be granted unless it is established that CBP was responsible for the untimely filing.

(iii) *Special timeframes.* For substitution claims, the exportation or destruction of merchandise shall not have preceded the date of importation of the designated imported merchandise, and/or the exportation or destruction of merchandise shall not otherwise be outside of the timeframes specified in 19 U.S.C. 1313(c)(2)(C) and 19 U.S.C. 1313(p)(2), if applicable.

(2) *Major disaster.* The 5-year period for filing a complete drawback claim provided for in paragraph (e)(1) of this section may be extended for a period not to exceed 18 months if:

(i) The claimant establishes to the satisfaction of CBP that the claimant was unable to file the drawback claim because of an event declared by the President to be a major disaster, within the meaning given to that term in 42 U.S.C. 5122(2), on or after January 1, 1994; and

(ii) The claimant files a request for such extension with CBP no later than 1 year from the last day of the 5-year period referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.

(3) *Record retention.* If an extension is granted with respect to a request filed under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the periods of time for retaining records under 19 U.S.C. 1508(c)(3) will be extended for an additional 18 months.
