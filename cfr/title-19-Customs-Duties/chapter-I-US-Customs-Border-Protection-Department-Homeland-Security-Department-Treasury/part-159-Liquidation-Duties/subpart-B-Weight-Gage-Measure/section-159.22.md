##### ยง 159.22 Net weights and tares. #####

(a) *Determination of net weight.* The net weight of merchandise dutiable by net weight, or upon a value dependent upon net weight, shall be determined insofar as possible by obtaining the actual weight, or by deducting the actual or schedule tare from the gross weight. Actual tare may be determined on the basis of tests when the tares of the packages in a shipment are reasonably uniform.

(b) *Invoice net weight or tare.* When the actual net weight or tare cannot reasonably be determined and no schedule tare is applicable, liquidation may be made on the basis of the invoice net weight or tare.

(c) *Schedule tare.* The following tares, which, from experience, have proved to be the average for certain classes of merchandise shall be known as schedule tares and shall be applied, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section:

Apple boxes. 2.984 kilograms per box. This schedule tare includes the paper wrappers, if any, on the apples.

China clay in so-called half-ton casks: 26.856 kilograms per cask.

Figs in skeleton cases: Actual tare for outer containers plus 13 percent of the gross weight of the inside wooden boxes and figs.

Fresh tomatoes: 113 grams per 100 paper wrappings.

Lemons and oranges: 283 grams per box and 142 grams per half box for paper wrappings, and actual tare for outer containers.

Ocher, dry, in casks: Eight percent of the gross weight.

Ocher, in oil, in casks: Twelve percent of the gross weight.

Pimientos in tins imported from Spain: The following schedule drained weight shall be used as the Customs dutiable weight in the liquidation of entries, the difference between the weight of the new contents of pimientos in tins and such drained weight being the allowance made in liquidation for tare for water:

|Size can |        Drained weight         |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 3 kilo  |13.6 kilograms-case of 6 tins. |
|794 grams|16.7 kilograms-case of 24 tins.|
|425 grams|8.0 kilograms-case of 24 tins. |
|198 grams|3.9 kilograms-case of 24 tins. |
|113 grams|2.4 kilograms-case of 24 tins. |

Tobacco, leaf not stemmed: 5.9 kilograms per bale: Sumatra: actual tare for outside coverings, plus 1.9 kilograms for the inside matting and, if a certificate is attached to the invoice certifying that the bales contain paper wrapping and specifying whether light or heavy paper has been used, either 113 grams or 227 grams for the paper wrapping according to the thickness of paper used.

(d) *Actual tare.* In the following circumstances, the actual tare shall be ascertained and in so doing the weigher shall empty and weigh as many casks, boxes, and other coverings as he may deem necessary:

(1) If the importer is not satisfied with the invoice tare or with the schedule tare;

(2) If the port director is of the opinion that the invoice or schedule tare does not correctly represent the tare of the merchandise; or

(3) If the weigher has reason to believe that the invoice or schedule tare is greater than the real tare.

(e) *Estimated tare.* When it is impracticable to ascertain the actual tare, the weigher shall state in his report what, in his judgment, constitutes a fair tare allowance.

(f) *Weight for value purposes.* In determining the total dutiable value of merchandise which is subject to ad valorem duty and appraised on the basis of weight, liquidation shall be made on the same basis as appraisement. For example, if appraisement is made on the basis of gross weight, the unit value shall be multiplied by the total gross weight in computing the total value even though net weight may be used for other purposes in liquidation, such as in determining total specific duties.
