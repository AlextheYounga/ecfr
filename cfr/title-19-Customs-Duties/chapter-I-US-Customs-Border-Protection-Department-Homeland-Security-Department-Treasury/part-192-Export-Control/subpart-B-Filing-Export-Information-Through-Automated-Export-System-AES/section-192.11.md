##### § 192.11 Description of the AES. #####

AES is a voluntary program that allows all exporters required to report commodity export information (*see,* 15 CFR 30.16) to submit such information electronically, rather than on paper, and sea carriers to report required outbound vessel information electronically (*see,* §§ 4.63, 4.75, and 4.76 of this chapter). Eligibility and application procedures are found at subpart E of part 30 of the Census Regulations (15 CFR part 30, subpart E), denominated Electronic Filing Requirements - Exporters. These Census Regulations (15 CFR part 30, subpart E) provide that exporters may choose to submit export information through AES by any one of three electronic filing options available. Only Option 4, the complete post-departure submission of export information, requires prior approval by participating agencies before it can be used by AES participants.
