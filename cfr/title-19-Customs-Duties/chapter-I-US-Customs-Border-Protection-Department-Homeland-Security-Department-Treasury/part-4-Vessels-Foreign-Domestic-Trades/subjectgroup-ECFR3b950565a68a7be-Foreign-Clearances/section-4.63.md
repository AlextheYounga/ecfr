##### § 4.63 Outward cargo declaration; shippers' export declarations. #####

(a) No vessel shall be cleared directly for a foreign port, or for a foreign port by way of another domestic port or other domestic ports (see § 4.87(b)), unless there has been filed with the appropriate Customs officer at the port from which clearance is being sought:

(1) A Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, Customs Form 1302-A. Copies of bills of lading or equivalent commercial documents relating to all cargo encompassed by the manifest must be attached in such manner as to constitute one document, together with a Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement, Customs Form 1300, and export declarations as are required by pertinent regulations of the Bureau of the Census, Department of Commerce; or

(2) An incomplete Cargo Declaration as provided for in § 4.75.

(b) Except as hereafter stated, the number of the export declaration covering each shipment for which an authenticated export declaration is required shall be shown on the Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, Customs Form 1302-A, in the marginal column headed “B/L No.” If an export declaration is not required for a shipment, a notation shall be made on the Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms (Customs Form 1302-A) describing the basis for the exemption with a reference to the number of the section in the Census Regulations (see 15 CFR 30.39, 30.50 through 30.57) where the particular exemption is provided. If shipments are exempt on the basis of value and destination, the appearance of the value and destination on a bill of lading or other commercial documents is acceptable as evidence of the exemption and reference to the applicable section in the Census Regulations is not required.

(c) The following minimal information shall be included on the Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, Customs Form 1302-A (other information required to be on a Customs Form 1302-A as shown on the form itself must also be included thereon) or on attached copies of bills of lading or equivalent commercial documents:

(1) Name and address of shipper;

(2) Description of the cargo (see paragraph (d) of this section);

(3) Number of packages and gross weight (see paragraph (d) of this section);

(4) Name of vessel or carrier;

(5) Port of exit (this shall be the port where the merchandise is loaded on the vessel); and

(6) Port of destination (this shall be the foreign port of discharge of the merchandise).

(d) If the bills of lading or equivalent commercial documents attached to the Customs Form 1302-A show on their face the cargo information required by columns 6, 7, and either column 8 or 9, of the Customs Form 1302-A, that information need not be shown again on the Customs Form 1302-A. However, in that case, the cargo information must be incorporated by a suitable reference on the face of the Customs Form 1302-A such as “Cargo as per attached commercial documents.”

(e) For each shipment to be exported under an entry or withdrawal for exportation or for transportation and exportation, the Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, Customs Form 1302-A, or commercial document attached to the Cargo Declaration and made a part thereof in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, shall clearly show for such shipment the number, date, and class of such Customs entry or withdrawal (i.e., T. & E., Wd. T. & E., I. E., Wd. Ex., or Wd. T., as applicable) and the name of the port where the merchandise is laden for exportation.

(f) Customs officers shall accept a Cargo Declaration Outward With Commercial Forms, Customs Form 1302-A, covering containerized or palletized cargo which indicates by the use of appropriate words of qualification (see § 4.7a(c)(3)) that the declaration has been prepared on the basis of information furnished by the shipper.
