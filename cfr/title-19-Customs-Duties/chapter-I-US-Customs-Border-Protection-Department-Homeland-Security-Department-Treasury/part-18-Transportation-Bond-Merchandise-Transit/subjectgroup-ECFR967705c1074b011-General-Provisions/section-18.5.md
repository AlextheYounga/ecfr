##### ยง 18.5 Diversion. #####

(a) Merchandise forwarded under any class of transportation entry may be diverted to any port other than the port named in the entry at the option of the consignee or agent.

(b) The director of the port to which merchandise is diverted may permit merchandise in transit under bond under any class of transportation entry to be entered at his port for consumption, warehouse, exportation, further transportation in bond, or under any provisions of the tariff laws.

(c) When merchandise which has been delivered to the director of the port of original destination or port of diversion under any class of transportation entry is to be forwarded to another port or returned to the port of origin, a new transportation entry shall be required. If the merchandise is moving under cover of a carnet, the carnet may be accepted as a transportation entry.

(d) If it is desired to split a shipment at a port of destination and to enter a portion for consumption or warehouse and forward the balance in bond, or to divert the entire shipment or a part thereof to more than one port, the director of the port where diversion takes place shall complete the original transaction and shall require the filing of a new transportation entry or entries for the portion or portions forwarded. In the case, however, of merchandise being transported under cover of a carnet, splitting up of a shipment shall not be permitted.
