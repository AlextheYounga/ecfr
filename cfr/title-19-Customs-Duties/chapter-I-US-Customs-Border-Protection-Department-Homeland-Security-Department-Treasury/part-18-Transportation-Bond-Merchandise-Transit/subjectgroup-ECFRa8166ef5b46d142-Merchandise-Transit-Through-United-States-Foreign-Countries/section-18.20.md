##### § 18.20 Entry procedure; forwarding. #####

(a) When an importation is entered for transportation and exportation, except as provided for in subparts D, E, F and G of part 123 of this chapter (relating to merchandise in transit through the U.S. between two points in contiguous foreign territory), a carnet, three copies of an air waybill (see § 122.92 of this chapter), or four copies of Customs Form 7512 shall be required. The port director, however, may require additional copies of Customs Form 7512 or the Goods Manifest of the carnet for use in connection with the delivery of the merchandise to, the bonded carrier. In lieu of additional copies of a Goods Manifest, the port director may accept copies of a bill of lading covering the merchandise. Acceptance of transportation and exportation entries shall be subject to the requirements prescribed in § 18.11(b) for entry of merchandise for immediate transportation without appraisement.

(b) Except in respect to merchandise covered by a carnet (see § 18.1(a) (2) and (3)), in places where no bonded common carrier facilities are reasonably available and merchandise is permitted to be transported otherwise than by a bonded common carrier, the port director may permit entry in accordance with the procedure outlined in paragraph (a) of this section if he is satisfied that the revenue will not be endangered. A bond on Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter in an amount equal to double the estimated duties shall be required when the port director deems such action necessary. (See § 113.55 of this chapter for cancellation of export bonds.)

(c) The merchandise shall be forwarded in accordance with the general provisions for transportation in bond, §§ 18.1 through 18.8.
