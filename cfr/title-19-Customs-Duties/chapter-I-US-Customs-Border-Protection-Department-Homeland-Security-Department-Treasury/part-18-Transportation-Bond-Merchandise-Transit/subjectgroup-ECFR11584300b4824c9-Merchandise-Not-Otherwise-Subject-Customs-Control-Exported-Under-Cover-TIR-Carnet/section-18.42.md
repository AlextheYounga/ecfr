##### ยง 18.42 Direct exportation. #####

At the port of exportation, the container or road vehicle, the merchandise, and the TIR carnet must be made available to the port director. Any required Electronic Export Information (EEI) must be filed in accordance with the applicable regulations of the Census Bureau (15 CFR part 30) and the Office of Export Control (15 CFR part 386). The port director will examine the merchandise to the extent he believes necessary to determine that the carnet has been properly completed and will verify that the container or road vehicle has the necessary certificate of approval or approval plate intact and is in satisfactory condition. After completion of any required examination and supervision of loading, the port director will cause the container or road vehicle to be sealed with Customs seals and ascertain that the TIR plates are properly affixed and sealed. (See ยง 18.4a.) In the case of heavy or bulky goods moving under cover of a TIR carnet, the port director will cause a Customs seal or label, as appropriate, to be affixed. He will also remove two vouchers from the carnet, execute the appropriate counterfoils, and return the carnet to the carrier or agent to accompany the merchandise.
