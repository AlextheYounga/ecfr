I certify that all chemical substances in this shipment are not subject to TSCA.

(ii) *Blanket certifications.* A port director may, in his discretion, approve an importer's use of a “blanket” certification, in lieu of filing a separate certification for each chemical shipment, for any chemical shipment that conforms to a product description provided to Customs pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(ii)(A) of this section.

(C) An importer for whom the use of a “blanket” certification has been approved must include, on the invoice used in connection with the entry and entry summary procedures for each shipment covered by the “blanket” certification, a statement referring to the “blanket” certification and incorporating it by reference. This statement need not be signed.

(b) *Chemical substances or mixtures as parts of articles.* Each importer of a chemical substance or mixture as part of an article must comply with the certification requirements set forth in paragraph (a) of this section only if required to do so by a rule or order issued under TSCA.
