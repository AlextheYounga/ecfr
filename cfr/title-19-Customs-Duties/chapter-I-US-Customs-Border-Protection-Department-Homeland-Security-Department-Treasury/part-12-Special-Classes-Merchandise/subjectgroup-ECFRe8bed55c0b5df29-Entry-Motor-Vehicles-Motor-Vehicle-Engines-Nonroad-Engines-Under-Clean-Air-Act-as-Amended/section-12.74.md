Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 94979, Dec. 27, 2016.This amendment was delayed until Mar. 21, 2017, at 82 FR 8589, Jan. 27, 2017.

(a) *Applicability of EPA regulations.* The requirements governing the importation of nonroad and stationary engines subject to conformance with applicable emissions standards of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are contained in EPA regulations, issued under the Clean Air Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 7401 *et seq.*). These EPA regulations should be consulted for detailed information as to the admission requirements for subject nonroad and stationary engines. See 40 CFR part 1068, subpart D, with the following exceptions:

(1) For nonroad compression-ignition regulated under 40 CFR part 89, see 40 CFR part 89, subpart G. This applies to certain engines through the 2011 model year.

(2) For nonroad spark-ignition engines at or below 19 kilowatts regulated under 40 CFR part 90, see 40 CFR part 90, subpart G. This applies to certain engines through the 2011 model year.

(3) For marine compression-ignition engines regulated under 40 CFR part 94, see 40 CFR part 94, subpart I. This includes propulsion engines and auxiliary engines installed on marine vessels. This applies to certain engines through the 2013 model year.

(b) *Admission of nonconforming nonroad engines* - (1) *EPA declaration form required.* EPA Form 3520-21, “Importation of Engines, Vehicles, and Equipment Subject to Federal Air Pollution Regulations”, must be completed by the importer and retained on file by him before making a customs entry for such nonroad or stationary engines/vehicles/equipment.

(2) *Retention and submission of records to CBP.* Documents supporting the information required in the EPA declaration must be retained by the importer for at least five years in accordance with § 163.4 of this chapter and shall be provided to CBP upon request.

(c) *Release under bond* - (1) *Conditional admission.* If the EPA declaration states that the entry for a nonconforming nonroad engine is being filed under one of the exemptions described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, under which the engine must be conditionally admitted under bond, the entry for such engine shall be accepted only if a bond is given on CBP Form 301 containing the conditions set forth in § 113.62 of this chapter for the presentation of an EPA statement that the engine has been brought into conformity with Federal emissions requirements.

(2) *Final admission.* Should final admission be sought and granted pursuant to EPA regulations for an engine conditionally admitted initially under one of the exemptions described in paragraphs (c)(3) of this section, the importer or consignee shall deliver to the port director the prescribed statement. The statement shall be delivered within the period authorized by EPA for the specific exemption, or such additional period as the port director of CBP may allow for good cause shown. Otherwise, the importer or consignee shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the port director the subject engine, either for export or other disposition under applicable CBP laws and regulations (see paragraph (e) of this section). If such engine is not redelivered within five days following the allotted period, liquidated damages shall be assessed in the full amount of the bond, if a single entry bond, or if a continuous bond, the amount that would have been taken under a single entry bond (see 40 CFR 89.612(d), 90.613(c) and (d), 94.805(c) and (d), and 1068.335).

(3) *Exemptions.* The specific exemptions under which a nonconforming nonroad engine may be conditionally admitted, and for which a CBP bond is required, are as follows:

(i) Repairs or alterations (see 40 CFR 89.611(b)(1), 90.612(b)(1), 94.804(b)(1), 1068.325(a)).

(ii) Testing (see 40 CFR 89.611(b)(2), 90.612(b)(2), 94.804(b)(2), 1068.325(b)).

(iii) Display (see 40 CFR 89.611(b)(4), 90.612(b)(3), 94.804(b)(4), 1068.325(c)).

(iv) Precertification (see 40 CFR 89.611(b)(3)).

(d) *Notice of inadmissibility or detention.* If an engine is found to be inadmissible either before or after release from CBP custody, the importer or consignee shall be notified in writing of the inadmissibility determination and/or redelivery requirement. However, an engine which cannot be released merely due to a failure to furnish with the entry any documentary information as required by EPA shall be held in detention by the port director for a period not to exceed 30 days after filing of the entry at the risk and expense of the importer pending submission of the missing information. An additional 30-day extension may be granted by the port director upon application for good cause shown. If at the expiration of a period not over 60 days the required documentation has not been filed, a notice of inadmissibility will be issued.

(e) *Disposal of engines not entitled to admission; prohibited importations.* A nonroad or stationary engine denied admission under EPA regulations shall be disposed of consistent with such EPA regulations and in accordance with applicable CBP laws and regulations. The importation of nonroad or stationary engines other than as prescribed under EPA regulations is prohibited.
