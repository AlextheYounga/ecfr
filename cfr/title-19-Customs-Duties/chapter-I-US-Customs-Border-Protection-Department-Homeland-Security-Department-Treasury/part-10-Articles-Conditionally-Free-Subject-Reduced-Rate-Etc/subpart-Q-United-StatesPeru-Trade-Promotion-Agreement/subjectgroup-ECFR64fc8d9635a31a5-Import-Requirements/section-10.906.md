(2) A commercial importation for which the value of the originating goods does not exceed U.S. $2,500.

(b) *Exception.* If the port director determines that an importation described in paragraph (a) of this section is part of a series of importations carried out or planned for the purpose of evading compliance with the certification requirements of ยง 10.904 of this subpart, the port director will notify the importer that for that importation the importer must submit to CBP a copy of the certification.
