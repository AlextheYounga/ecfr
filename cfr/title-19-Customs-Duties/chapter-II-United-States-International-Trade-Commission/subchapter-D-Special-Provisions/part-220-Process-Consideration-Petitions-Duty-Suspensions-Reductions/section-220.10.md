##### § 220.10 Commission review of petitions and disclosure forms. #####

(a) *Commission publication and public availability.* Not later than 30 days after expiration of the 60-day period for filing petitions for duty suspensions and reductions, the Commission will publish on its Web site the petitions for duty suspensions and reductions submitted under § 220.3 that were timely filed and contain the information required under § 220.5. When circumstances allow, the Commission may post such petitions on its Web site earlier than 30 days after expiration of the 60-day period for filing petitions.

(b) *Public comment.* Not later than 30 days after expiration of the 60-day period for filing petitions, the Commission will also publish in the Federal Register and on its Web site a notice requesting members of the public to submit comments on the petitions for duty suspensions and reductions. To be considered, such comments must be filed through the Commission's secure web portal during the 45-day period following publication of the Commission's notice requesting comments from members of the public. Comments, including any attachments thereto, must otherwise comply with the Commission's Handbook on MTB Filing Procedures as posted on the Commission's Web site. For purposes of this section, all petitions posted by the Commission on its Web site, whether or not posted early, shall be deemed to be officially published by the Commission on its Web site on the date of publication of the notice seeking written comments from members of the public on the petitions.
