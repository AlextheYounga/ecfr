##### § 207.94 Protection of privileged information during panel and committee proceedings. #####

When and if a panel or extraordinary challenge committee decides that the Commission is required, pursuant to the United States law, to grant access pursuant to protective order to information for which the Commission has claimed a privilege, any individual to whom a panel or extraordinary challenge committee has directed the Commission release information and who is otherwise within the category of individuals eligible to receive proprietary information pursuant to 19 CFR 207.93(b), may file an application for a protective order with the Commission. Upon receipt of such application, the Commission Secretary shall certify to the Commission that a panel or extraordinary challenge committee has required the Commission to release such information to specified persons, pursuant to 19 U.S.C. 1677f(f)(1). Twenty-four hours following such certification, the Commission Secretary shall issue a protective order releasing such information to any authorized applicant subject to terms and conditions equivalent to those described in 19 CFR 207.93(c)(2).
