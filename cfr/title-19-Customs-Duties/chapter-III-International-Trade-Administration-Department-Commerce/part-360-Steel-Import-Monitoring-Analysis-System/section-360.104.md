##### ยง 360.104 Steel import monitoring. #####

Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 56171, Sept. 11, 2020.

(a) Throughout the duration of the licensing requirement, Commerce will maintain an import monitoring system on the SIMA system Web site that will report certain aggregate information on imports of steel mill products obtained from the steel licenses. Aggregate data will be reported on a monthly basis by country of origin and steel mill product category and will include import quantity (metric tons), import Customs value (U.S. $), and average unit value ($/metric ton). The Web site will also contain certain aggregate data at the 6-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule level and will also present a range of historical data for comparison purposes. Provision of this aggregate data on the Web site may be revisited should concerns arise over the possible release of proprietary data.

(b) Reported monthly import data will be refreshed each week with new data on licenses issued during the previous week. This data will also be adjusted periodically for cancelled or unused steel import licenses, as appropriate.
