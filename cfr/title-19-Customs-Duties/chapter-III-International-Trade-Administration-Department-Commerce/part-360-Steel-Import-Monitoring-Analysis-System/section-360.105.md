Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 56172, Sept. 11, 2020.

The licensing program will be in effect through March 21, 2022, but may be extended upon review and notification in the Federal Register prior to this expiration date. Licenses will be required on all subject imports entered during this period, even if the entry summary documents are not filed until after the expiration of this program. The licenses will be valid for 10 business days after the expiration of this program to allow for the final filing of required Customs documentation.
