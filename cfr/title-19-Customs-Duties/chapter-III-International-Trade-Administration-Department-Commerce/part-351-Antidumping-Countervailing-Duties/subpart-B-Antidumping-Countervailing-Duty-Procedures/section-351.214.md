Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 52371, Sept. 20, 2021.

(a) *Introduction.* The URAA established a new procedure by which so-called “new shippers” can obtain their own individual dumping margin or countervailable subsidy rate on an expedited basis. In general, a new shipper is an exporter or producer that did not export, and is not affiliated with an exporter or producer that did export, to the United States during the period of investigation. This section contains rules regarding requests for new shipper reviews and procedures for conducting such reviews. In addition, this section contains rules regarding requests for expedited reviews by noninvestigated exporters in certain countervailing duty proceedings and procedures for conducting such reviews.

(b) *Request for new shipper review* - (1) *Requirement of sale or export.* Subject to the requirements of section 751(a)(2)(B) of the Act and this section, an exporter or producer may request a new shipper review if it has exported, or sold for export, subject merchandise to the United States.

(2) *Contents of request.* A request for a new shipper review must contain the following:

(i) If the person requesting the review is both the exporter and producer of the merchandise, a certification that the person requesting the review did not export subject merchandise to the United States (or, in the case of a regional industry, did not export the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned) during the period of investigation;

(ii) If the person requesting the review is the exporter, but not the producer, of the subject merchandise:

(A) The certification described in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section; and

(B) A certification from the person that produced or supplied the subject merchandise to the person requesting the review that that producer or supplier did not export the subject merchandise to the United States (or, in the case of a regional industry, did not export the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned) during the period of investigation;

(iii)(A) A certification that, since the investigation was initiated, such exporter or producer has never been affiliated with any exporter or producer who exported the subject merchandise to the United States (or in the case of a regional industry, who exported the subject merchandise for sale in the region concerned) during the period of investigation, including those not individually examined during the investigation;

(B) In an antidumping proceeding involving imports from a nonmarket economy country, a certification that the export activities of such exporter or producer are not controlled by the central government;

(iv) Documentation establishing:

(A) The date on which subject merchandise of the exporter or producer making the request was first entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, or, if the exporter or producer cannot establish the date of first entry, the date on which the exporter or producer first shipped the subject merchandise for export to the United States;

(B) The volume of that and subsequent shipments; and

(C) The date of the first sale to an unaffiliated customer in the United States; and

(v) In the case of a review of a countervailing duty order, a certification that the exporter or producer has informed the government of the exporting country that the government will be required to provide a full response to the Department's questionnaire.

(c) *Deadline for requesting review.* An exporter or producer may request a new shipper review within one year of the date referred to in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section.

(d) *Time for new shipper review* - (1) *In general.* The Secretary will initiate a new shipper review under this section in the calendar month immediately following the anniversary month or the semiannual anniversary month if the request for the review is made during the 6-month period ending with the end of the anniversary month or the semiannual anniversary month (whichever is applicable).

(2) *Semiannual anniversary month.* The semiannual anniversary month is the calendar month which is 6 months after the anniversary month.

(3) *Example.* An order is published in January. The anniversary month would be January, and the semiannual anniversary month would be July. If the Secretary received a request for a new shipper review at any time during the period February-July, the Secretary would initiate a new shipper review in August. If the Secretary received a request for a new shipper review at any time during the period August-January, the Secretary would initiate a new shipper review in February.

(e) *Suspension of liquidation; posting bond or security.* When the Secretary initiates a new shipper review under this section, the Secretary will direct the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of any unliquidated entries of the subject merchandise from the relevant exporter or producer, and to allow, at the option of the importer, the posting, until the completion of the review, of a bond or security in lieu of a cash deposit for each entry of the subject merchandise.

(f) *Rescission of new shipper review* - (1) *Withdrawal of request for review.* The Secretary may rescind a new shipper review under this section, in whole or in part, if a party that requested a review withdraws its request not later than 60 days after the date of publication of notice of initiation of the requested review.

(2) *Absence of entry and sale to an unaffiliated customer.* The Secretary may rescind a new shipper review, in whole or in part, if the Secretary concludes that:

(i) As of the end of the normal period of review referred to in paragraph (g) of this section, there has not been an entry and sale to an unaffiliated customer in the United States of subject merchandise; and

(ii) An expansion of the normal period of review to include an entry and sale to an unaffiliated customer in the United States of subject merchandise would be likely to prevent the completion of the review within the time limits set forth in paragraph (i) of this section.

(3) *Notice of Rescission.* If the Secretary rescinds a new shipper review (in whole or in part), the Secretary will publish in the Federal Register notice of “Rescission of Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) New Shipper Review” or, if appropriate, “Partial Rescission of Antidumping (Countervailing Duty) New Shipper Review.”

(g) *Period of review* - (1) *Antidumping proceeding* - (i) *In general.* Except as provided in paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section, in an antidumping proceeding, a new shipper review under this section normally will cover, as appropriate, entries, exports, or sales during the following time periods:

(A) If the new shipper review was initiated in the month immediately following the anniversary month, the twelve-month period immediately preceding the anniversary month; or

(B) If the new shipper review was initiated in the month immediately following the semiannual anniversary month, the period of review will be the six-month period immediately preceding the semiannual anniversary month.

(ii) *Exceptions.* (A) If the Secretary initiates a new shipper review under this section in the month immediately following the first anniversary month, the review normally will cover, as appropriate, entries, exports, or sales during the period from the date of suspension of liquidation under this part to the end of the month immediately preceding the first anniversary month.

(B) If the Secretary initiates a new shipper review under this section in the month immediately following the first semiannual anniversary month, the review normally will cover, as appropriate, entries, exports, or sales during the period from the date of suspension of liquidation under this part to the end of the month immediately preceding the first semiannual anniversary month.

(2) *Countervailing duty proceeding.* In a countervailing duty proceeding, the period of review for a new shipper review under this section will be the same period as that specified in § 351.213(e)(2) for an administrative review.

(h) *Procedures.* The Secretary will conduct a new shipper review under this section in accordance with § 351.221.

(i) *Time limits* - (1) *In general.* Unless the time limit is waived under paragraph (j)(3) of this section, the Secretary will issue preliminary results of review (*see* § 351.221(b)(4)) within 180 days after the date on which the new shipper review was initiated, and final results of review (*see* § 351.221(b)(5)) within 90 days after the date on which the preliminary results were issued.

(2) *Exception.* If the Secretary concludes that a new shipper review is extraordinarily complicated, the Secretary may extend the 180-day period to 300 days, and may extend the 90-day period to 150 days.

(j) *Multiple reviews.* Notwithstanding any other provision of this subpart, if a review (or a request for a review) under § 351.213 (administrative review), § 351.214 (new shipper review), § 351.215 (expedited antidumping review), or § 351.216 (changed circumstances review) covers merchandise of an exporter or producer subject to a review (or to a request for a review) under this section, the Secretary may, after consulting with the exporter or producer:

(1) Rescind, in whole or in part, a review in progress under this subpart;

(2) Decline to initiate, in whole or in part, a review under this subpart; or

(3) Where the requesting party agrees in writing to waive the time limits of paragraph (i) of this section, conduct concurrent reviews, in which case all other provisions of this section will continue to apply with respect to the exporter or producer.

(k) *Expedited reviews in countervailing duty proceedings for noninvestigated exporters* - (1) *Request for review.* If, in a countervailing duty investigation, the Secretary limited the number of exporters or producers to be individually examined under section 777A(e)(2)(A) of the Act, an exporter that the Secretary did not select for individual examination or that the Secretary did not accept as a voluntary respondent (*see* § 351.204(d)) may request a review under this paragraph (k). An exporter must submit a request for review within 30 days of the date of publication in the Federal Register of the countervailing duty order. A request must be accompanied by a certification that:

(i) The requester exported the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation;

(ii) The requester is not affiliated with an exporter or producer that the Secretary individually examined in the investigation; and

(iii) The requester has informed the government of the exporting country that the government will be required to provide a full response to the Department's questionnaire.

(2) *Initiation of review* - (i) *In general.* The Secretary will initiate a review in the month following the month in which a request for review is due under paragraph (k)(1) of this section.

(ii) *Example.* The Secretary publishes a countervailing duty order on January 15. An exporter would have to submit a request for a review by February 14. The Secretary would initiate a review in March.

(3) *Conduct of review.* The Secretary will conduct a review under this paragraph (k) in accordance with the provisions of this section applicable to new shipper reviews, subject to the following exceptions:

(i) The period of review will be the period of investigation used by the Secretary in the investigation that resulted in the publication of the countervailing duty order (*see* § 351.204(b)(2));

(ii) The Secretary will not permit the posting of a bond or security in lieu of a cash deposit under paragraph (e) of this section;

(iii) The final results of a review under this paragraph (k) will not be the basis for the assessment of countervailing duties; and

(iv) The Secretary may exclude from the countervailing duty order in question any exporter for which the Secretary determines an individual net countervailable subsidy rate of zero or *de minimis* (*see* § 351.204(e)(1)), provided that the Secretary has verified the information on which the exclusion is based.

(l) *Exception from assessment in regional industry cases.* For procedures relating to a request for the exception from the assessment of antidumping or countervailing duties in a regional industry case, see § 351.212(f).
