##### § 351.225 Scope rulings. #####

(a) *Introduction.* Issues arise as to whether a particular product is included within the scope of an antidumping or countervailing duty order or a suspended investigation. Such issues can arise because the descriptions of subject merchandise contained in the Department's determinations must be written in general terms. At other times, a domestic interested party may allege that changes to an imported product or the place where the imported product is assembled constitutes circumvention under section 781 of the Act. When such issues arise, the Department issues “scope rulings” that clarify the scope of an order or suspended investigation with respect to particular products. This section contains rules regarding scope rulings, requests for scope rulings, procedures for scope inquiries, and standards used in determining whether a product is within the scope of an order or suspended investigation.

(b) *Self-initiation.* If the Secretary determines from available information that an inquiry is warranted to determine whether a product is included within the scope of an antidumping or countervailing duty order or a suspended investigation, the Secretary will initiate an inquiry, and will notify all parties on the Department's scope service list of its initiation of a scope inquiry.

(c) *By application* - (1) *Contents and service of application.* Any interested party may apply for a ruling as to whether a particular product is within the scope of an order or a suspended investigation. The application must be served upon all parties on the scope service list described in paragraph (n) of this section, and must contain the following, to the extent reasonably available to the interested party:

(i) A detailed description of the product, including its technical characteristics and uses, and its current U.S. Tariff Classification number;

(ii) A statement of the interested party's position as to whether the product is within the scope of an order or a suspended investigation, including:

(A) A summary of the reasons for this conclusion,

(B) Citations to any applicable statutory authority, and

(C) Any factual information supporting this position, including excerpts from portions of the Secretary's or the Commission's investigation, and relevant prior scope rulings.

(2) *Deadline for action on application.* Within 45 days of the date of receipt of an application for a scope ruling, the Secretary will issue a final ruling under paragraph (d) of this section or will initiate a scope inquiry under paragraph (e) of this section.

(d) *Ruling based upon the application.* If the Secretary can determine, based solely upon the application and the descriptions of the merchandise referred to in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, whether a product is included within the scope of an order or a suspended investigation, the Secretary will issue a final ruling as to whether the product is included within the order or suspended investigation. The Secretary will notify all persons on the Department's scope service list (*see* paragraph (n) of this section) of the final ruling.

(e) *Ruling where further inquiry is warranted.* If the Secretary finds that the issue of whether a product is included within the scope of an order or a suspended investigation cannot be determined based solely upon the application and the descriptions of the merchandise referred to in paragraph (k)(1) of this section, the Secretary will notify by mail all parties on the Department's scope service list of the initiation of a scope inquiry.

(f) *Notice and procedure.* (1) Notice of the initiation of a scope inquiry issued under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section will include:

(i) A description of the product that is the subject of the scope inquiry; and

(ii) An explanation of the reasons for the Secretary's decision to initiate a scope inquiry;

(iii) A schedule for submission of comments that normally will allow interested parties 20 days in which to provide comments on, and supporting factual information relating to, the inquiry, and 10 days in which to provide any rebuttal to such comments.

(2) The Secretary may issue questionnaires and verify submissions received, where appropriate.

(3) Whenever the Secretary finds that a scope inquiry presents an issue of significant difficulty, the Secretary will issue a preliminary scope ruling, based upon the available information at the time, as to whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that the product subject to a scope inquiry is included within the order or suspended investigation. The Secretary will notify all parties on the Department's scope service list (see paragraph (n) of this section) of the preliminary scope ruling, and will invite comment. Unless otherwise specified, interested parties will have within twenty days from the date of receipt of the notification in which to submit comments, and ten days thereafter in which to submit rebuttal comments.

(4) The Secretary will issue a final ruling as to whether the product which is the subject of the scope inquiry is included within the order or suspended investigation, including an explanation of the factual and legal conclusions on which the final ruling is based. The Secretary will notify all parties on the Department's scope service list (*see* paragraph (n) of this section) of the final scope ruling.

(5) The Secretary will issue a final ruling under paragraph (k) of this section (other scope rulings) normally within 120 days of the initiation of the inquiry under this section. The Secretary will issue a final ruling under paragraph (g), (h), (i), or (j) of this section (circumvention rulings under section 781 of the Act) normally within 300 days from the date of the initiation of the scope inquiry.

(6) When an administrative review under § 351.213, a new shipper review under § 351.214, or an expedited antidumping review under § 351.215 is in progress at the time the Secretary provides notice of the initiation of a scope inquiry (*see* paragraph (e)(1) of this section), the Secretary may conduct the scope inquiry in conjunction with that review.

(7)(i) The Secretary will notify the Commission in writing of the proposed inclusion of products in an order prior to issuing a final ruling under paragraph (f)(4) of this section based on a determination under:

(A) Section 781(a) of the Act with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in the United States (other than minor completion or assembly);

(B) Section 781(b) of the Act with respect to merchandise completed or assembled in other foreign countries; or

(C) Section 781(d) of the Act with respect to later-developed products which incorporate a significant technological advance or significant alteration of an earlier product.

(ii) If the Secretary notifies the Commission under paragraph (f)(7)(i) of this section, upon the written request of the Commission, the Secretary will consult with the Commission regarding the proposed inclusion, and any such consultation will be completed within 15 days after the date of such request. If, after consultation, the Commission believes that a significant injury issue is presented by the proposed inclusion of a product within an order, the Commission may provide written advice to the Secretary as to whether the inclusion would be inconsistent with the affirmative injury determination of the Commission on which the order is based.

(g) *Products completed or assembled in the United States.* Under section 781(a) of the Act, the Secretary may include within the scope of an antidumping or countervailing duty order imported parts or components referred to in section 781(a)(1)(B) of the Act that are used in the completion or assembly of the merchandise in the United States at any time such order is in effect. In making this determination, the Secretary will not consider any single factor of section 781(a)(2) of the Act to be controlling. In determining the value of parts or components purchased from an affiliated person under section 781(a)(1)(D) of the Act, or of processing performed by an affiliated person under section 781(a)(2)(E) of the Act, the Secretary may determine the value of the part or component on the basis of the cost of producing the part or component under section 773(f)(3) of the Act.

(h) *Products completed or assembled in other foreign countries.* Under section 781(b) of the Act, the Secretary may include within the scope of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, at any time such order is in effect, imported merchandise completed or assembled in a foreign country other than the country to which the order applies. In making this determination, the Secretary will not consider any single factor of section 781(b)(2) of the Act to be controlling. In determining the value of parts or components purchased from an affiliated person under section 781(b)(1)(D) of the Act, or of processing performed by an affiliated person under section 781(b)(2)(E) of the Act, the Secretary may determine the value of the part or component on the basis of the cost of producing the part or component under section 773(f)(3) of the Act.

(i) *Minor alterations of merchandise.* Under section 781(c) of the Act, the Secretary may include within the scope of an antidumping or countervailing duty order articles altered in form or appearance in minor respects.

(j) *Later-developed merchandise.* In determining whether later-developed merchandise is within the scope of an antidumping or countervailing duty order, the Secretary will apply section 781(d) of the Act.

(k) *Other scope determinations.* With respect to those scope determinations that are not covered under paragraphs (g) through (j) of this section, in considering whether a particular product is included within the scope of an order or a suspended investigation, the Secretary will take into account the following:

(1) The descriptions of the merchandise contained in the petition, the initial investigation, and the determinations of the Secretary (including prior scope determinations) and the Commission.

(2) When the above criteria are not dispositive, the Secretary will further consider:

(i) The physical characteristics of the product;

(ii) The expectations of the ultimate purchasers;

(iii) The ultimate use of the product;

(iv) The channels of trade in which the product is sold; and

(v) The manner in which the product is advertised and displayed.

(l) *Suspension of liquidation.* (1) When the Secretary conducts a scope inquiry under paragraph (b) or (e) of this section, and the product in question is already subject to suspension of liquidation, that suspension of liquidation will be continued, pending a preliminary or a final scope ruling, at the cash deposit rate that would apply if the product were ruled to be included within the scope of the order.

(2) If the Secretary issues a preliminary scope ruling under paragraph (f)(3) of this section to the effect that the product in question is included within the scope of the order, any suspension of liquidation described in paragraph (l)(1) of this section will continue. If liquidation has not been suspended, the Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to suspend liquidation and to require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for each unliquidated entry of the product entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of initiation of the scope inquiry. If the Secretary issues a preliminary scope ruling to the effect that the product in question is not included within the scope of the order, the Secretary will order any suspension of liquidation on the product ended, and will instruct the Customs Service to refund any cash deposits or release any bonds relating to that product.

(3) If the Secretary issues a final scope ruling, under either paragraph (d) or (f)(4) of this section, to the effect that the product in question is included within the scope of the order, any suspension of liquidation under paragraph (l)(1) or (l)(2) of this section will continue. Where there has been no suspension of liquidation, the Secretary will instruct the Customs Service to suspend liquidation and to require a cash deposit of estimated duties, at the applicable rate, for each unliquidated entry of the product entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of initiation of the scope inquiry. If the Secretary's final scope ruling is to the effect that the product in question is not included within the scope of the order, the Secretary will order any suspension of liquidation on the subject product ended and will instruct the Customs Service to refund any cash deposits or release any bonds relating to this product.

(4) If, within 90 days of the initiation of a review of an order or a suspended investigation under this subpart, the Secretary issues a final ruling that a product is included within the scope of the order or suspended investigation that is the subject of the review, the Secretary, where practicable, will include sales of that product for purposes of the review and will seek information regarding such sales. If the Secretary issues a final ruling after 90 days of the initiation of the review, the Secretary may consider sales of the product for purposes of the review on the basis of non-adverse facts available. However, notwithstanding the pendency of a scope inquiry, if the Secretary considers it appropriate, the Secretary may request information concerning the product that is the subject of the scope inquiry for purposes of a review under this subpart.

(m) *Orders covering identical products.* Except for a scope inquiry and a scope ruling that involves section 781(a) or section 781(b) of the Act (assembly of parts or components in the United States or in a third country), if more than one order or suspended investigation cover the same subject merchandise, and if the Secretary considers it appropriate, the Secretary may conduct a single inquiry and issue a single scope ruling that applies to all such orders or suspended investigations.

(n) *Service of applications; scope service list.* The requirements of § 351.303(f) apply to this section, except that an application for a scope ruling must be served on all persons on the Department's scope service list. For purposes of this section, the “scope service list” will include all persons that have participated in any segment of the proceeding. If an application for a scope ruling in one proceeding results in a single inquiry that will apply to another proceeding (*see* paragraph (m) of this section), the Secretary will notify persons on the scope service list of the other proceeding of the application for a scope ruling.

(o) *Publication of list of scope rulings.* On a quarterly basis, the Secretary will publish in the Federal Register a list of scope rulings issued within the last three months. This list will include the case name, reference number, and a brief description of the ruling.
