##### ยง 875.404 What is the effective date of coverage? #####

(a) The effective dates of coverage under open season enrollments will be announced in a Federal Register Notice that announces open season dates.

(b)(1) If you enroll at any time outside of an open season, your coverage effective date is the 1st day of the month after the date your application is approved.

(2) If you are an active workforce member and you are applying for coverage under abbreviated underwriting, you also must be actively at work at least 1 day during the calendar week immediately before the week which contains your coverage effective date for your coverage to become effective. You must inform the Carrier if you do not meet this requirement. In the event you do not meet this requirement, the Carrier will issue you a revised effective date, which will be the 1st day of the next month. You also must meet the actively at work requirement for any revised effective date for coverage to become effective, or you will be issued another revised effective date in the same manner.
