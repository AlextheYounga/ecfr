##### ยง 875.410 May I continue my coverage when I leave Federal or military service? #####

If you are an active workforce member, your coverage will automatically continue when you leave active service, as long as the Carrier continues to receive the required premium when due. However, once you leave active service, you are no longer eligible for any abbreviated underwriting provided during any future open season.
