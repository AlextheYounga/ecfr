##### ยง 875.206 As a new active workforce member, when may I apply? #####

(a) As a new, newly eligible, or returning active workforce member, you may apply as follows:

(1) If you are a new active workforce member entering a position that conveys eligibility, you may apply for coverage within 60 days after becoming eligible.

(2) If you are entering a position that conveys eligibility as an active workforce member from a position that did not convey eligibility, you may apply for coverage within 60 days after becoming eligible.

(3) If you return to active service after a break in service of 180 days or more to a position that conveys eligibility, you may apply for coverage within 60 days after becoming eligible.

(b) Your spouse may also apply during that 60-day period after you become eligible.

(c) The underwriting requirements that will be required will be those applicable to active workforce members and their spouses during the last open season for enrollment before the date of your application.

(d) After the 60-day period ends, you may still apply for coverage, as may your spouse, but full underwriting requirements will apply.

(e) If your employing office determines that you were unable, for a cause beyond your control, to submit an application during the initial 60-day period, you may submit an application within 60 days after your employing office advises you of that determination. Similarly, your employing office may make this determination if your spouse is unable to submit an application during the same time period for a cause beyond his/her control. This employing office authority only applies within 6 months after the beginning date of the initial eligibility period. The underwriting requirements will be as specified in paragraph (c) of this section.

(f) Your other qualified relatives may apply for coverage at any time. They will be subject to full underwriting requirements.
