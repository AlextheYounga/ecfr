Short Title

Sec. 1. This Act may be cited as the “Federal Employees Part-Time Career Employment Act of 1978”.

Congressional Findings and Purpose

Sec. 2. (a) The Congress finds that—

(1) many individuals in our society possess great productive potential which goes unused because they cannot meet the requirements of a standard workweek; and

(2) part-time permanent employment—

(A) provides older individuals with a gradual transition into retirement;

(B) provides employment opportunities to handicapped individuals or others who require a reduced workweek;

(C) provides parents opportunities to balance family responsibilities with the need for additional income;

(D) benefits students who must finance their own education or vocational training;

(E) benefits the Government, as an employer, by increasing productivity and job satisfaction, while lowering turnover rates and absenteeism, offering management more flexibility in meeting work requirements, and filling shortages in various occupations; and

(F) benefits society by offering a needed alternative for those individuals who require or prefer shorter hours (despite the reduced income), thus increasing jobs available to reduce unemployment while retaining the skills of individuals who have training and experience.

(b) The purpose of this Act is to provide increased part-time career employment opportunities throughout the Federal Government.
