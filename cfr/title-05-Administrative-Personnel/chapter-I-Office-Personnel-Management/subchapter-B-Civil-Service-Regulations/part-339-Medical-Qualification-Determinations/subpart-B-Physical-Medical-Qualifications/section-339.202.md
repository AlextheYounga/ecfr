##### ยง 339.202 Medical standards. #####

OPM may establish or approve medical standards for a Governmentwide occupation (*i.e.,* an occupation common to more than one agency). An agency may establish medical standards for positions that predominate in that agency (*i.e.,* where the agency has 50 percent or more of the positions in a particular occupation). Such standards must be justified on the basis that the duties of the position are arduous or hazardous, or require a certain level of health status or fitness because the nature of the positions involve a high degree of responsibility toward the public or sensitive national security concerns. The rationale for establishing the standard must be documented. Standards established by OPM or an agency must be:

(a) Established by written directive and uniformly applied,

(b) Directly related to the actual requirements of the position.
