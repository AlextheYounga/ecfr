(b) Personnel decisions based wholly or in part on the review of medical documentation and the results of medical examinations and evaluations shall be made in accordance with appropriate parts of this title.

(c) Failure to meet a properly established medical standard or physical requirement under this part means that the individual is not qualified for the position unless a waiver or reasonable accommodation is indicated, as described in §§ 339.103 and 339.204.
