##### § 339.103 Compliance with EEOC regulations. #####

Actions under this part must be consistent with 29 CFR 1613. 701 *et seq.* Particularly relevant to medical qualification determinations are § 1613.704 (requiring reasonable accommodation of individuals with handicaps); § 1613.705 (prohibiting use of employment criteria that screen out individuals with handicaps unless shown to be related to the job in question) and § 1614.706 (prohibiting pre-employment inquiries related to handicap and pre-employment medical examinations, except under specified circumstances). In addition, use of the term “qualified” in these regulations shall be interpreted consistently with § 1613.702(f), which provides that a “qualified handicapped person” is a handicapped person “who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the position in question without endangering the health and safety of the individual or others.”
