##### ยง 591.226 How does OPM apply the CPIs? #####

(a) OPM uses a three-step process to adjust price indexes by relative annual or biennial changes in the CPIs. For steps 1 and 2, OPM computes the annual change by dividing the CPI from 1 year after the survey by the CPI from the time of the survey. OPM computes the biennial change by dividing the CPI from 2 years after the survey by the CPI from the time of the survey.

(1) *Step 1.* OPM computes the annual or biennial CPI change for the COLA area.

(2) *Step 2.* OPM computes the annual or biennial CPI change for the DC area.

(3) *Step 3.* OPM multiplies the COLA area price index from the last survey by the COLA area CPI change computed in step 1 divided by the DC area CPI change computed in step 2. The adjusted price index is rounded to the second decimal place.

(b) *Example:*

|                            |     2008     |     2009     |
|----------------------------|--------------|--------------|
|       COLA Area CPI        |    172.2     |    174.7     |
|        DC Area CPI         |    159.7     |    161.9     |
|   COLA Area Survey Index   |    117.33    |(<sup>1</sup>)|
|COLA Area CPI Adjusted Index|(<sup>2</sup>)|    117.42    |
|  <sup>1</sup> No survey.   |              |              |
|      <sup>2</sup> N/A      |              |              |

Computation:

117.33 ร (174.7/172.2)/(161.9/159.7) = 117.4159, which would round to 117.42.
