##### ยง 894.405 What happens if I go into nonpay status or if my pay/annuity is insufficient to cover the allotments? #####

(a) If your pay, *annuity*, or *compensation* is too low to cover the premium allotments, or if you go into a nonpay status, contact the *Administrator* to arrange to pay your premiums directly to the Administrator.

(b) If you do not make the premium payments, your FEDVIP coverage will stop. You will not be able to reenroll until the next open season after:

(1) You are in pay status; or

(2) Your pay is sufficient to make the premium allotments.
