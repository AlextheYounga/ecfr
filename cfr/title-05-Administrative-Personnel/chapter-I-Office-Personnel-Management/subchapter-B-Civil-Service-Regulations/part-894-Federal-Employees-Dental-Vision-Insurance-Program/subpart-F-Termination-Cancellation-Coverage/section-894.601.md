##### ยง 894.601 When does my FEDVIP coverage stop? #####

(a) If you no longer meet the definition of an eligible *employee* or *annuitant*, your FEDVIP coverage stops at the end of the pay period in which you were last eligible.

(b) If you go into a period of nonpay or insufficient pay, and you do not make direct premium payments, your FEDVIP coverage stops at the end of the pay period for which your agency, retirement system, or *OWCP* last made a premium allotment from your pay.

(c) If you are making direct premium payments, and you stop making the payments, your FEDVIP coverage stops at the end of the pay period for which you last made a payment.

(d) If you cancel your enrollment during an open season, your FEDVIP coverage stops at midnight of the *day* before the effective date of an open season change as set by OPM.

(e) If you are enrolled with a combination dental and vision *carrier* with a restricted service area, and you move outside the *carrier's* service area to a service area that does not offer a combination *carrier* and you change to a dental only or vision only *carrier*, your existing combination plan coverage will stop at midnight of the *day* before the effective date of your new plan coverage.

(f) If your FEDVIP carrier discontinues participation in the program at the end of the contract year, then you must change to another *carrier* during the open season, unless OPM establishes a different time. If the discontinuance is at a time other than the end of the contract year, OPM will establish a time and effective date for you to change your carrier. If you do not change your carrier within the time set by OPM, your coverage will stop at midnight of the *day* before the effective date set by OPM for coverage with another *carrier.*
