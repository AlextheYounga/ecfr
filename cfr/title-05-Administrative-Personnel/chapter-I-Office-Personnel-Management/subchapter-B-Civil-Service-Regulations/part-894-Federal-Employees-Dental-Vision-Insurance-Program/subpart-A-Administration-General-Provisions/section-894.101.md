(2) The child of an enrollee and a domestic partner who otherwise meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (8) of the definition of *Domestic partnership* in this section, but live in a state that has authorized marriage by same-sex couples prior to the first day of Open Season, shall not be considered a stepchild who is the child of a domestic partner in the following plan year. The determination of whether a state's marriage laws render a child ineligible for coverage as a stepchild who is the child of a domestic partner shall be made once annually, based on the law of the state where the same-sex couple lives on the last day before Open Season begins for enrollment for the following year. A child's eligibility for coverage as a stepchild who is the child of a domestic partner in a particular plan year shall not be affected by a mid-year change to a state's marriage law or by the couple's relocation to a different state. For midyear enrollment changes involving the addition of a new stepchild, as defined by this regulation, outside of Open Season, the determination of whether a state's marriage laws render the child ineligible for coverage shall be made at the time the employee notifies the employing office of his or her desire to cover the child. Coverage of children of domestic partners terminates on January 1, 2016, unless an agency requests, and OPM grants, the agency a continued coverage exception for enrollees living overseas. Continued coverage exceptions will only be granted to children of domestic partners living overseas and all coverage exceptions will end on September 30, 2018.
