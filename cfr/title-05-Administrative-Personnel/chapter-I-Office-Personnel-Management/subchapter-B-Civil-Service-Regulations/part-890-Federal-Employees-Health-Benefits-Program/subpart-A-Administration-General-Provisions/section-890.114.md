##### § 890.114 Surprise billing. #####

(a) A carrier must comply with requirements described in 26 CFR 54.9816-3T through 54.9816-6T, 54.9817-1T, and 54.9822-1T, 29 CFR 2590.716-3 through 2590.716-6, 2590.717-1, and 2590.722, and 45 CFR 149.30, 149.110 through 149.140, and 149.310 in the same manner as such provisions apply to a group health plan or health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage, subject to 5 U.S.C. 8902(m)(1), and the provisions of the carrier's contract. For purposes of application of such sections, all carriers are deemed to offer health benefits in the large group market.

(b) For purposes of the provisions referenced in paragraph (a) of this section:

*Group health plan or plan* shall mean a “health benefits plan” defined at 5 U.S.C. 8901(6), which is a Federal governmental plan offered pursuant to 5 U.S.C. chapter 89.

*Health insurance issuer or issuer* shall include a carrier defined at 5 U.S.C. 8901(7). Where the carrier for a health benefits plan is a voluntary association, an association of organizations or entities, or is otherwise comprised of multiple entities, each entity is responsible for compliance in the same manner as such sections apply to group health plans and issuers. If and to the extent an entity offering a health benefits plan under 5 U.S.C. chapter 89 is licensed under state law and is properly considered an issuer as defined at section 2791 of the Public Health Service Act, the entity is considered a carrier to the extent of its FEHB health benefits plan contractual and regulatory compliance.

*Participant, beneficiary, or enrollee* shall include an “enrollee” or “covered individual” as defined by 5 CFR 890.101, as appropriate.

(c) When a complaint challenges a carrier's action or inaction with respect to the surprise billing provisions, OPM will coordinate with the Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and the Treasury to resolve the complaint.
