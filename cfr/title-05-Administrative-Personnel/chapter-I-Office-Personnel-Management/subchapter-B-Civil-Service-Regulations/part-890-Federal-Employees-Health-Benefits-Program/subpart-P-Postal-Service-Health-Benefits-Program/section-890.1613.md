##### § 890.1613 Contributions and withholdings. #####

(a) *In general.* The calculations for contributions and withholdings for coverage under this subpart will be made in the same manner as 5 U.S.C. 8906 and subpart E of this part.

(b) *Postal Service contribution.* The Government contribution with respect to the Postal Service for health benefits plans under this subpart shall be determined annually in accordance with § 890.501 commencing 2024 using the weighted average of rates offered by PSHB plans for the following year with respect to self only, self plus one, and self and family enrollments. For the initial contract year, the weighted average applicable for determining the Government contribution by the Postal Service will be determined using the calculation at 5 U.S.C. 8903c(i), except that OPM will use available data with respect to Postal Service enrollment for 2024, taking into account 2023 data.

(c) *Medicare late enrollment penalty.* Upon request by the Postal Service, and only until the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund is depleted, OPM will pay out of the Fund any late enrollment penalties required under section 1839(e)(1) of the Social Security Act for individuals who enrolled during the special enrollment period established under section 1837(o) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395p).

(d) *Calculations for the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund.* As directed by 5 U.S.C. 8909a OPM shall make annual computations with respect to the cost of claims attributable to Postal Service annuitants and their covered family members, and the United States Postal Service shall pay into the Fund annually according to those computations.

(e) *Clarification of statutory terms.* OPM has determined that “future net claims costs” in the calculation in 5 U.S.C. 8909a(e)(1) is equivalent to “estimated net claims costs” as defined in 5 U.S.C. 8909a(g).
