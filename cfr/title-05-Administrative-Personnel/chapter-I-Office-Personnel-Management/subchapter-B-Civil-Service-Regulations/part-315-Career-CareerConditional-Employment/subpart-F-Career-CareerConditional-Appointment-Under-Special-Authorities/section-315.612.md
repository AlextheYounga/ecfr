##### § 315.612 Noncompetitive appointment of certain military spouses. #####

(a) *Agency authority.* In accordance with the provisions of this section, an agency may appoint noncompetitively a spouse of a member of the armed forces serving on active duty who has orders specifying a permanent change of station (not for training), a spouse of a 100 percent disabled service member injured while on active duty, or the un-remarried widow or widower of a service member who was killed while performing active duty.

(b) *Definitions.* (1) *Active duty* means full-time duty in the armed forces, including full-time National Guard duty, except that for Reserve Component members the term “active duty” does not include training duties or attendance at service schools.

(2) *Armed forces* has the meaning given that term in 10 U.S.C. 101.

(3) *Duty station* means the permanent location to which a member of the armed forces is assigned for duty as specified on the individual's permanent change of station (PCS) orders.

(4) *Member of the armed forces* or *service member* means an individual who:

(i) Is serving on active duty in the armed forces under orders specifying the individual is called or ordered to active duty for more than 180 consecutive days, has been issued orders for a permanent change of station, and is authorized for dependent travel (*i.e.*, the travel of the service member's family members) as part of the orders specifying the individual's permanent change of station;

(ii) Retired from active duty in the armed forces with a service-connected disability rating of 100 percent as documented by a branch of the armed forces, or retired or was released or discharged from active duty in the armed forces and has a disability rating of 100 percent as documented by the Department of Veterans Affairs; or

(iii) Was killed while serving on active duty in the armed forces.

(5) *Permanent change of station* means the assignment, reassignment, or transfer of a member of the armed forces from his or her present duty station or location without return to the previous duty station or location.

(6) *Spouse* means the husband or wife of a member of the armed forces.

(c) *Eligibility.* (1) A spouse of a member of the armed forces as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section must have:

(i) Married the member of the armed forces on, or prior to, the date of the service member's orders authorizing a permanent change of station; and

(ii) Relocated with the member of the armed forces to the new duty station specified in the documentation ordering a permanent change of station.

(2) A spouse of a member of the armed forces as defined in paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section must be the un-remarried widow or widower of the member of the armed forces killed on active duty in the armed forces.

(3) For spouses eligible under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, noncompetitive appointment under this section is limited to the geographic area, as specified on the service member's permanent change of station orders. It includes the service member's duty station and the surrounding area from which people reasonably can be expected to travel daily to and from work. The head of an agency, or his or her designee, may waive this limitation (*i.e.*, accept applications from spouses) if no Federal agency exists in the spouse's geographic area. Spouses of active duty military members who are on retirement or separation PCS orders from active duty are not eligible to be appointed using this authority unless the service member is injured with a 100 percent disability.

(4) Spouses of retired or separated active duty members who have a 100 percent disability are not restricted to a geographical location.

(ii) From the date of documentation verifying the member of the armed forces is 100 percent disabled; or

(iii) From the date of documentation verifying the member of the armed forces was killed while on active duty.

(2) A spouse may receive only one noncompetitive appointment under this section to a permanent position per the service member's orders authorizing a permanent change of station.

(3) Any law, Executive order, or regulation that disqualifies an applicant for appointment also disqualifies a spouse for appointment under this section.
