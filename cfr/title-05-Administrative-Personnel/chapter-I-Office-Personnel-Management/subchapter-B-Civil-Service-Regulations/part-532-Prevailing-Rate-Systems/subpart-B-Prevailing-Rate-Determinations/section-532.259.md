Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 22693, May 20, 2019.

(a) Lead agencies shall establish and issue special wage schedules for U.S. civil service wage employees in certain U.S. insular areas. The Department of Defense is the lead agency for Guam, Midway, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Department of Transportation is the lead agency for American Samoa. The Department of the Interior is the lead agency for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. These schedules shall provide rates of pay for nonsupervisory, leader, supervisory, and production facilitating employees.

(b) Special schedules shall be established at the same time and with rates identical to the foreign area appropriated fund wage schedules established under § 532.255 of this subpart.

(c) Wage employees recruited from outside the insular area where employed, who meet the same eligibility requirements as those specified for General Schedule employees in § 591.209 of subpart B of part 591, are also paid as a part of basic pay a differential for recruitment and retention purposes. The differential rate shall be that established for General Schedule employees in appendix B of subpart B of part 591 and shall be adjusted effective concurrently with the special schedules.
