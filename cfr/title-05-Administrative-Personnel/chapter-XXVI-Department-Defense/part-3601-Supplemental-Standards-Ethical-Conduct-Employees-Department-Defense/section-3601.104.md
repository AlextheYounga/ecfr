##### ยง 3601.104 Additional limitations on gifts between DoD employees. #####

The following limitations shall apply to gifts from groups of DoD employees that include a subordinate and to voluntary contributions to gifts for superiors permitted under 5 CFR 2635.304(c)(1):

(a) *Gifts from a group that includes a subordinate.* Regardless of the number of DoD employees contributing to a gift on a special, infrequent occasion as permitted by 5 CFR 2635.304(c)(1), a DoD employee may not accept a gift or gifts from a donating group if the market value exceeds an aggregate of $300 and if the DoD employee knows or has reason to know that any member of the donating group is his subordinate.

(1) The cost of items excluded from the definition of a gift by 5 CFR 2635.203(b) and the cost of food, refreshments and entertainment provided to the DoD employee and his personal guests to mark the occasion for which the gift is given shall not be included in determining whether the value of a gift or gifts exceeds the $300 aggregate limit.

(2) The value of a gift or gifts from two or more donating groups shall be aggregated and shall be considered to be from a single donating group if the DoD employee offered the gift knows or has reason to know that an individual who is his subordinate is a member of more than one of the donating groups.

(b) *Voluntary contribution.* For purposes of 5 CFR 2635.304(c)(1), the nominal amount of a voluntary contribution that a DoD employee may solicit from another DoD employee for a group gift to the contributing DoD employee's superior for any special, infrequent occasion shall not exceed $10. A voluntary contribution of a nominal amount for food, refreshments and entertainment for the superior, the personal guests of the superior and other attendees at an event to mark the occasion for which a group gift is given may be solicited as a separate, voluntary contribution not subject to the $10 limit.
