##### § 9800.8 Multitrack processing. #####

(a) CIGIE processes requests using a multitrack processing system. There are four processing tracks: An expedited track, if the request qualifies; a simple track for relatively simple requests; a complex track for more complex and lengthy requests; and a remanded track, when a FOIA appeal is granted.

(b) CIGIE processes requests on a “first-in, first-out” basis for each track, unless there are unusual circumstances as referenced in § 9800.14, or the requester is entitled to expedited processing as described in § 9800.11.
