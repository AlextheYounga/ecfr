##### ยง 9800.13 Handling commercial information obtained from a private business. #####

When CIGIE cannot readily determine whether the information in its records is privileged or confidential commercial information, it is CIGIE's policy to obtain and consider the views of the submitter of the information and to provide an opportunity to object to any decision prior to disclosure of the information. If CIGIE receives a request for information that has been submitted by a business, CIGIE shall:

(a) Provide the submitter of commercial information with notification of a FOIA request for that information, unless CIGIE readily determines that the information requested should not be disclosed or, alternately, that the information is not exempt from disclosure by law;

(b) Afford the submitter reasonable time in which to object to the disclosure of any specified portion of the information. The submitter must fully explain all grounds for objecting to disclosure of any specified portion of the information. For example, if the submitter maintains that disclosure is likely to cause it substantial competitive harm, the submitter must explain on an item-by-item basis why disclosure would cause such harm. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this part may itself be subject to disclosure under FOIA;

(c) Notify the FOIA requester of the need to inform the submitter of a request for the submitted commercial information;

(d) Determine whether the records requested are exempt from disclosure or must be released after carefully considering all reasons provided by a submitter for objecting to disclosure;

(e) Prior to the disclosure date, notify submitters of any determination to disclose such records so that the matter may be considered for possible judicial intervention; and

(f) Notify submitters promptly in all cases in which FOIA requesters bring suit seeking to compel disclosure of submitted information.
