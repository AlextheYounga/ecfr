Note 1 to ยง 10300.102.

There is a special approval requirement set out in both 18 U.S.C. 203(d) and 205(e) for certain representational activities otherwise covered by the conflict-of-interest restrictions on compensation and activities of employees in claims against and other matters affecting the Government. Thus, an employee who wishes to act as an agent or attorney for, or otherwise represent the employee's parents, spouse, child, or any person for whom, or any estate for which, the employee is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary in such matters, must obtain the approval required by law of the government official responsible for the employee's appointment, in addition to the regulatory approval required in this section.
