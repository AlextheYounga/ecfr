Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 2852, January 10, 2017.

(a) The 20-day period (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays), established in this section, shall commence on the date on which the request is first received by the appropriate component of the agency (Regional Director, the Freedom of Information Officer of the Office of the General Counsel, the Solicitor of the Authority, the Executive Director of the Panel, or the IG of the Authority), but in any event not later than ten days after the request is first received by any Authority component responsible for receiving FOIA requests under part 2411. The 20-day period does not run when -

(1) The agency component makes one request to the requester for information and is awaiting such information that it has reasonably requested from the requester; or

(2) It is necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fee assessment.

(3) The agency component's receipt of the requested information or clarification triggers the commencement of the 20-day period.

(b) A request for records shall be logged in by the appropriate Regional Director, the Freedom of Information Officer of the General Counsel, the Solicitor of the Authority, the Executive Director of the Panel or the IG, as appropriate, pursuant to § 2411.6(c). All requesters must reasonably describe the records sought. An oral request for records shall not begin any time requirement. A written request for records sent to other than the appropriate officer will be forwarded to that officer by the receiving officer, but in that event the applicable time limit for response shall begin as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Except as provided in § 2411.11, the appropriate Regional Director, the Freedom of Information Officer of the General Counsel, the Solicitor of the Authority, the Executive Director of the Panel, or the IG, as appropriate, shall, within twenty (20) working days following receipt of the request, as provided by paragraph (a) of this section, respond in writing to the requester, determining whether, or the extent to which, the request shall be complied with.

(1) If all the records requested have been located and a final determination has been made with respect to disclosure of all of the records requested, the response shall so state.

(2) If all of the records have not been located or a final determination has not been made with respect to disclosure of all the records requested, the response shall state the extent to which the records involved shall be disclosed pursuant to the rules established in this part.

(3) If the request is expected to involve allowed charges in excess of $250.00, the response shall specify or estimate the fee involved and shall require prepayment of any charges in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (g) of § 2411.13 before the request is processed further.

(4) Whenever possible, subject to the provisions of paragraph (g) of § 2411.13, the response relating to a request for records that involves a fee of less than $250.00 shall be accompanied by the requested records. Where this is not possible, the records shall be forwarded as soon as possible thereafter, consistent with other obligations of the Authority, the General Counsel, the Panel, or the IG.

(5) Search fees shall not be assessed requesters (or duplication fees in the case of an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or a representative of the news media requester, as defined by § 2411.13(a)(8)), under this subparagraph if an agency component fails to make a final determination with respect to disclosure of all records requested as described under subparagraph (c)(1) of this section within any time limit under paragraph (a) of this section, if no unusual or exceptional circumstances (as those terms are defined for purposes of § 2411.11(a)) apply to the processing of the request.

(d) If a request will take longer than ten days to process:

(1) An individualized tracking number will be assigned to the request and provided to the requester; and

(2) Using the tracking number, the requester can find, by calling (202) 218-7770 or linking to *http://www.flra.gov/foia/foia\_main.html*, status information about the request including:

(i) The date on which the agency originally received the request; and

(ii) An estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request.

(e) If any request for records is denied in whole or in part, the response required by paragraph (c) of this section shall notify the requester of the denial. Such denial shall specify the reason therefore, set forth the name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial, and notify the person making the request of the right to appeal the denial under the provisions of § 2411.10.
