##### ยง 2424.30 Procedure through which the petition for review will be resolved. #####

(a) *Exclusive representative has filed related unfair labor practice charge or grievance alleging an unfair labor practice.* Except for proposals or provisions that are the subject of an agency's compelling need claim under 5 U.S.C. 7117(a)(2), where an exclusive representative files an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter or a grievance alleging an unfair labor practice under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure, and the charge or grievance concerns issues directly related to the petition for review filed pursuant to this part, the Authority will dismiss the petition for review. The dismissal will be without prejudice to the right of the exclusive representative to refile the petition for review after the unfair labor practice charge or grievance has been resolved administratively, including resolution pursuant to an arbitration award that has become final and binding. No later than thirty (30) days after the date on which the unfair labor practice charge or grievance is resolved administratively, the exclusive representative may refile the petition for review, and the Authority will determine whether resolution of the petition is still required.

(b) *Exclusive representative has not filed related unfair labor practice charge or grievance alleging an unfair labor practice.* Where an exclusive representative files only a petition for review under this part, the petition will be processed as follows:

(1) *No bargaining obligation dispute exists.* Where there is no bargaining obligation dispute, the Authority will resolve the petition for review under the procedures of this part.

(2) *A bargaining obligation dispute exists.* Where a bargaining obligation dispute exists in addition to the negotiability dispute, the Authority will inform the exclusive representative of any opportunity to file an unfair labor practice charge pursuant to part 2423 of this subchapter or a grievance under the parties' negotiated grievance procedure and, where the exclusive representative pursues either of these courses, proceed in accord with paragraph (a) of this section. If the exclusive representative does not file an unfair labor practice charge or grievance, the Authority will proceed to resolve all disputes necessary for disposition of the petition unless, in its discretion, the Authority determines that resolving all disputes is not appropriate because, for example, resolution of the bargaining obligation dispute under this part would unduly delay resolution of the negotiability dispute, or the procedures in another, available administrative forum are better suited to resolve the bargaining obligation dispute.
