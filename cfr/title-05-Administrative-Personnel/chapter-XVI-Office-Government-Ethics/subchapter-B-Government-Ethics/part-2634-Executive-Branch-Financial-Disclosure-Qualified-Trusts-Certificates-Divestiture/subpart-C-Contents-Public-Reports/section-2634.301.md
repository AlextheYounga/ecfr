The report shall designate the category of value of the property in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section. Each item of real and personal property shall be disclosed separately. Note that for Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA's), brokerage accounts, trusts, mutual or pension funds and other entities with portfolio holdings, each underlying asset must be separately disclosed, unless the entity qualifies for special treatment under § 2634.310 of this subpart.

(e) *Valuation of interests in property.* A good faith estimate of the fair market value of interests in property may be made in any case in which the exact value cannot be obtained without undue hardship or expense to the filer. Fair market value may also be determined by:

(1) The purchase price (in which case, the filer should indicate date of purchase);

(2) Recent appraisal;

(3) The assessed value for tax purposes (adjusted to reflect the market value of the property used for the assessment if the assessed value is computed at less than 100 percent of that market value);

(4) The year-end book value of nonpublicly traded stock, the year-end exchange value of corporate stock, or the face value of corporate bonds or comparable securities;

(5) The net worth of a business partnership;

(6) The equity value of an individually owned business; or

(7) Any other recognized indication of value (such as the last sale on a stock exchange).

Example 1.An official has a $4,000 savings account in Bank A. His spouse has a $2,500 certificate of deposit issued by Bank B and his dependent daughter has a $200 savings account in Bank C. The official does not have to disclose the deposits, as the total value of the deposits in any one bank does not exceed $5,000. Note, however, that the source and the amount of interest income from any bank is required to be reported under § 2634.302(b) of this subpart if it exceeds the reporting threshold for income. See § 2634.309 of this subpart for disclosure coverage of spouses and dependent children.Example 2.Public filer R has a collection of post-impressionist paintings which have been carefully selected over the years. From time to time, as new paintings have been acquired to add to the collection, R has made sales of both less desirable works from his collection and paintings of various schools which he acquired through inheritance. Under these circumstances, R must report the value of all the paintings he retains as interests in property pursuant to this section, as well as income from the sales of paintings pursuant to § 2634.302(b) of this subpart. Recurrent sales from a collection indicate that the collection is being held for investment or the production of income.Example 3.A reporting individual has investments which her broker holds as an IRA and invests in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Each such asset having a fair market value in excess of $1,000 at the close of the reporting period must be separately listed, and the value must be shown. See § 2634.311(c) of this subpart for attachment of brokerage statements in lieu of listing, in the event of extensive holdings. Note that for a mutual fund held in this IRA investment account, its underlying assets must also be separately detailed, unless it qualifies as an excepted investment fund, pursuant to § 2634.310 of this subpart.[57 FR 11808, Apr. 7, 1992; 57 FR 21854, May 22, 1992, as amended at 65 FR 69656, Nov. 20, 2000; 71 FR 28233, May 16, 2006]
