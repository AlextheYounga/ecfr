##### § 2634.309 Spouses and dependent children. #####

(a) *Special disclosure rules.* Each report required by the provisions of subpart B of this part shall also include the following information with respect to the spouse or dependent children of the reporting individual:

(1) *Income.* For purposes of § 2634.302 of this subpart:

(i) With respect to a spouse, the source but not the amount of items of earned income (other than honoraria) which exceed $1,000 from any one source; and if items of earned income are derived from a spouse's self-employment in a business or profession, the nature of the business or profession but not the amount of the earned income;

(ii) With respect to a spouse, the source and the actual amount or value of any honoraria received by or accrued to the spouse (or payments made or to be made to charity on the spouse's behalf in lieu of honoraria) which exceed $200 from any one source, and the date on which the services were provided; and

(iii) With respect to a spouse or dependent child, the type and source, and the amount or value (category or actual amount, in accordance with § 2634.302 of this subpart), of all other income exceeding $200 from any one source, such as investment income from interests in property (if the property itself is reportable according to § 2634.301 of this subpart).

Example 1.The spouse of a filer is employed as a teller at Bank X and earns $23,000 per year. The report must disclose that the spouse is employed by Bank X. The amount of the spouse's earnings need not be disclosed.Example 2.The spouse of a reporting individual is self-employed as a pediatrician. The report must disclose that he is a physician, but need not disclose the amount of income.

(2) *Gifts and reimbursements.* For purposes of § 2634.304 of this subpart, gifts and reimbursements received by a spouse or dependent child which are not received totally independent of their relationship to the filer.

(3) *Interests in property, transactions, and liabilities.* For purposes of §§ 2634.301, 2634.303, and 2634.305 of this subpart, all information concerning property interests, transactions, or liabilities referred to by those sections of a spouse or dependent child, unless the following three conditions are satisfied:

(i) The filer certifies that the item represents the spouse's or dependent child's sole financial interest or responsibility, and that the filer has no specific knowledge regarding that item;

(ii) The item is not in any way, past or present, derived from the income, assets or activities of the filer; and

(iii) The filer neither derives, nor expects to derive, any financial or economic benefit from the item.

Note:

One who prepares a joint tax return with his spouse will normally derive a financial or economic benefit from assets held by the spouse, and will also be charged with knowledge of such items; therefore he could not avail himself of this exception. Likewise, a trust for the education of one's minor child normally will convey a financial benefit to the parent. If so, the assets of the trust would be reportable on a financial disclosure statement.

(b) *Exception.* For reports filed as a new entrant, nominee, or candidate under § 2634.201(b), (c), or (d), no information regarding gifts and reimbursements or transactions is required for a spouse or dependent child.

(c) *Divorce and separation.* A reporting individual need not report any information about:

(1) A spouse living separate and apart from the reporting individual with the intention of terminating the marriage or providing for permanent separation;

(2) A former spouse or a spouse from whom the reporting individual is permanently separated; or

(3) Any income or obligations of the reporting individual arising from dissolution of the reporting individual's marriage or permanent separation from a spouse.
