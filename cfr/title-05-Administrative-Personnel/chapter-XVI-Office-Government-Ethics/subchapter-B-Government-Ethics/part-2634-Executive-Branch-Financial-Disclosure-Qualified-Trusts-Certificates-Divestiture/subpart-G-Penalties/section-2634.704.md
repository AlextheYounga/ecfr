##### § 2634.704 Late filing fee. #####

(a) *In general.* In accordance with section 104(d) of the Act, any reporting individual who is required to file a public financial disclosure report by the provisions of this part shall remit a late filing fee of $200 to the appropriate agency, payable to the U.S. Treasury, if such report is filed more than thirty days after the later of:

(1) The date such report is required to be filed pursuant to the provisions of this part; or

(2) The last day of any filing extension period granted pursuant to § 2634.201(f).

(b) *Exceptions.* (1) The designated agency ethics official may waive the late filing fee if he determines that the delay in filing was caused by extraordinary circumstances, including the agency's failure to notify a new entrant, first-time annual filer, or termination filer of the requirement to file the public financial disclosure report, which made the delay reasonably necessary.

(2) Employees requesting a waiver of the late filing fee from the designated agency ethics official must request the waiver in writing with supporting documentation. The designated agency ethics official's determination must be made in writing to the employee with a copy placed in the employee's public financial disclosure report file. The designated agency ethics official may consult with the Office of Government Ethics prior to approving any waiver of the late filing fee.

(c) *Procedure.* (1) The designated agency ethics official shall maintain a record of the due dates for all public reports which the employees of that agency must file, along with the new filing dates under extensions which have been granted. Each report received by the agency shall be marked with the date of receipt. For any report which has not been received by the end of the period specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the agency shall advise the delinquent filer, in writing, that:

(i) Because his financial disclosure report is more than thirty days overdue, a $200 late filing fee will become due at the time of filing, by reason of section 104(d) of the Act and § 2634.704;

(ii) The filer is directed to remit to the agency, with the completed report, the $200 fee, payable to the United States Treasury;

(iii) If the filer fails to remit the $200 fee when filing his late report, it shall be subject to agency debt collection procedures; and

(iv) If extraordinary circumstances exist that would justify a request for a fee waiver, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, such request and supporting documentation must be submitted immediately.

(2) Upon receipt from the reporting individual of the $200 late filing fee, the collecting agency shall note the payment in its records, and shall then forward the money to the U.S. Treasury for deposit as miscellaneous receipts, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3302 and section 8030.30 of Volume 1 of the Treasury Financial Manual. If payment is not forthcoming, agency debt collection procedures shall be utilized, which may include salary or administrative offset, initiation of a tax refund offset, or other authorized action.

(d) *Late filing fee not exclusive remedy.* The late filing fee is in addition to other sanctions which may be imposed for late filing. See § 2634.701 of this subpart.

(e) *Confidential filers.* The late filing fee does not apply to confidential filers. Late filing of confidential reports will be handled administratively under § 2634.701(d) of this subpart.

(f) *Date of filing.* The date of filing for purposes of determining whether a public financial disclosure report is filed more than thirty days late under this section will be the date of receipt by the agency, which should be noted on the report in accordance with § 2634.605(a). The thirty-day grace period on imposing a late filing fee is adequate allowance for administrative delays in the receipt of reports by an agency.
