##### ยง 2634.804 Evidence of compliance. #####

(a) *Requisite evidence of action taken.* (1) For ethics agreements of nominees to positions requiring the advice and consent of the Senate, evidence of any action taken to comply with the terms of such ethics agreements shall be submitted by the designated agency ethics official, upon receipt of the evidence, to the Office of Government Ethics and to the Senate confirmation committee.

(2) For ethics agreements of incumbents in positions which required the advice and consent of the Senate, evidence of any action taken to comply with the terms of such ethics agreements shall be submitted promptly by the designated agency ethics official to the Office of Government Ethics. A designated agency ethics official or an employee referred to in ยง 2634.803(c) of this subpart who is neither a nominee to, nor an incumbent in, an advice-and-consent position, must also promptly send evidence of any action taken to comply with the terms of an ethics agreement to the Office of Government Ethics.

(3) In the case of all other reporting individuals, evidence of any action taken to comply with the terms of an ethics agreement must be sent promptly to the designated agency ethics official.

(b) The following materials and any other appropriate information constitute evidence of the action taken:

(1) *Recusal.* A copy of any recusal instrument listing and describing the specific matters or subjects to which the recusal applies, a statement of the method by which the agency will enforce the recusal, and a list of the positions of those agency employees involved in the enforcement (*i.e.,* the individual's immediate subordinates and supervisors).

Example:A new employee of a Federal safety board owns stock in Nationwide Airlines. She has entered into an ethics agreement to recuse herself from participating in any accident investigations involving that company's aircraft until such time as she can complete a divestiture of the asset. She must give a copy of the recusal instrument to her immediate subordinates and supervisors, and to the designated agency ethics official. The employee has also agreed to recuse herself from any particular matter (as that term is used in 18 U.S.C. 208) that might arise with respect to any of her present or future holdings. There is no requirement to execute a recusal instrument for this type of general recusal, because it is simply a promise to abide by the terms of the statute.

(2) *Divestiture or resignation.* Written notification that the divestiture or resignation has occurred.

(3) *Waivers.* A copy of any waivers issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 208(b)(1) or (b)(3) and signed by the appropriate supervisory official.

(4) *Blind or diversified trusts.* Information required by subpart D of this part to be submitted to the Office of Government Ethics for its certification of any qualified trust instrument. If the Office of Government Ethics does not certify the trust, the designated agency ethics official and, as appropriate, the Senate confirmation committee should be informed immediately.
