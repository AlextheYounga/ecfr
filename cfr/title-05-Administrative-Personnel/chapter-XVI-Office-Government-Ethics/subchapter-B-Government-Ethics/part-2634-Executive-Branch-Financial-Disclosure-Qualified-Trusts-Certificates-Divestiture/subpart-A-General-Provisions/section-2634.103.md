##### ยง 2634.103 Executive agency supplemental regulations. #####

(a) This regulation is intended to provide uniformity for executive branch financial disclosure systems. However, an agency may, subject to the prior written approval of the Office of Government Ethics, issue supplemental regulations implementing this part, if necessary to address special or unique agency circumstances. Such regulations:

(1) Shall be consistent with the Act, Executive Orders 12674 and 12731, and this part; and

(2) Shall impose no additional reporting requirements on either public or confidential filers, unless specifically authorized by the Office of Government Ethics as supplemental confidential reporting.

Note:

Supplemental regulations will not be used to satisfy the separate requirement of 5 U.S.C. App. (Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Section 402(d)(1)) that each agency have established written procedures on how to collect, review, evaluate, and, where appropriate, make publicly available, financial disclosure statements filed with it.

(b) Requests for approval of supplemental regulations under paragraph (a) of this section shall be submitted in writing to the Office of Government Ethics, and shall set forth the agency's need for any proposed supplemental reporting requirements. See ยง 2634.901 (b) and (c).

(c) Agencies should review all of their existing financial disclosure regulations to determine which of those regulations must be modified or revoked in order to conform with the requirements of this part. Any amendatory agency regulations shall be processed in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.
