Note 1 to the definition of “guidance document”:

As described in 5 CFR part 2638, OGE issues a number of documents to agency ethics officials and officers and employees of the executive branch concerning the government ethics laws and regulations and ethics program management. These documents are generally exempted from the definition of guidance document pursuant to this definition. In the rare case that a document does constitute a guidance document not otherwise excluded from the definition, the procedures set forth in this part will apply.

*OGE* means the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, or the organizational unit within the office responsible for conducting the relevant provisions of this part.

*Significant guidance document* means a guidance document that will be disseminated to regulated entities or the general public and that may reasonably be anticipated:

(2) To create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another Federal agency;

(3) To alter materially the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or

(4) To raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866, as further amended.
