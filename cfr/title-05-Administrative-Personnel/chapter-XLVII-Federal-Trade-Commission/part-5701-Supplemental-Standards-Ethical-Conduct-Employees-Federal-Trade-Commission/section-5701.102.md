##### § 5701.102 Fundraising activities. #####

When engaging in personal fundraising, as described at 5 CFR 2635.808(c), an employee of the Federal Trade Commission may, notwithstanding the prohibition of § 2635.808(c)(1)(i), personally solicit funds from a person who is a prohibited source only under 5 CFR 2635.203(d)(3) (*i.e.,* because the person “conducts activities regulated by” the Commission). The other provisions of § 2635.808(c) continue to apply to any such personal fundraising.

Example 1:A Federal Trade Commission employee is president of the local branch of her college alumni association. The association is seeking contributions from local businesses. The employee may, during her off-duty hours, seek a contribution from a company that is regulated by the Commission, but not from one that she knows is currently under Commission investigation or is seeking official action by the Commission, does business or seeks to do business with the Commission, or has interests that may be substantially affected by the employee's job. While the Standards of Conduct provide that companies under the agency's enforcement authority generally are prohibited sources of an employee's fundraising in a personal capacity, § 5701.102 provides that employees of the FTC may seek charitable contributions from an entity that is a prohibited source only because its activities are subject to agency regulation.[63 FR 43070, Aug. 12, 1998]
