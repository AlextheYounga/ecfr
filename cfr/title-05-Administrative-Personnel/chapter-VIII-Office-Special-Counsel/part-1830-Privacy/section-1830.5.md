##### § 1830.5 Appeals. #####

(a) *Appeals of adverse determinations.* A requester may appeal a denial of a Privacy Act request for access to or amendment of records to the Legal Counsel and Policy Division, U.S. Office of Special Counsel, 1730 M Street, N.W. (Suite 218), Washington, DC 20036-4505. The appeal must be in writing, and sent by regular mail or by fax. The appeal must be received by the Legal Counsel and Policy Division within 45 days of the date of the letter denying the request. For the quickest possible handling, the appeal letter and envelope or any fax cover sheet should be clearly marked “Privacy Act Appeal.” An appeal will not be considered to have been received by OSC until it reaches the Legal Counsel and Policy Division. The appeal letter may include as much or as little related information as the requester wishes, as long as it clearly identifies the OSC determination (including the assigned request number, if known) being appealed. An appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes a matter of litigation.

(b) *Responses to appeals.* The agency decision on an appeal will be made in writing. A final determination will be issued within 30 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays), unless, for good cause shown, OSC extends the 30-day period.
