##### ยง 1810.1 Investigative policy in discrimination complaints. #####

The Special Counsel is authorized to investigate allegations of discrimination prohibited by law, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(1). Since procedures for investigating discrimination complaints have already been established in the agencies and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Special Counsel will normally avoid duplicating those procedures and will defer to those procedures rather than initiating an independent investigation.
