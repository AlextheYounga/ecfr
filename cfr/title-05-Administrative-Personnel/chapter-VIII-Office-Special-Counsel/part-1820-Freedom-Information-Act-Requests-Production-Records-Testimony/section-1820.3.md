##### ยง 1820.3 Consultations and referrals. #####

When OSC receives a FOIA request for a record in the agency's possession, it may determine that another office is better able to decide whether or not the record is exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. If so, OSC will either:

(a) Respond to the request for the record after consulting with the other office that has a substantial interest in the record; or

(b) Refer the responsibility for responding to the request to another Federal agency deemed better able to determine whether to disclose it. Consultations and referrals will be handled according to the date that the FOIA request was initially received by the first agency or Federal government office.
