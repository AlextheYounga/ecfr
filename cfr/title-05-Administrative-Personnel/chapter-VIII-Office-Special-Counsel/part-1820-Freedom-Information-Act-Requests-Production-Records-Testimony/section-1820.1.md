Further information about the FOIA and access to OSC records is available on the FOIA page of OSC's Web site (*https://www.osc.gov*). Information routinely provided to the public as part of a regular OSC activity - for example, forms, press releases issued by the public affairs officer, records published on the agency's Web site, or public lists maintained at OSC headquarter offices pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 1219 - may be requested and provided to the public without following this part. This part also addresses responses to demands by a court or other authority to an employee for production of official records or testimony in legal proceedings.
