##### § 1820.6 Appeals. #####

(a) *Appeals of adverse determinations.* A requester may appeal an adverse determination denying a FOIA request in any respect to the Office of General Counsel, U.S. Office of Special Counsel, 1730 M Street NW., Suite 218, Washington, DC 20036-4505. The appeal must be in writing, and must be submitted either by:

(1) Regular mail sent to the address listed in this subsection, above; or

(2) By fax sent to the FOIA Officer at, (202) 254-3711, the number provided on the FOIA page of OSC's Web site *https://osc.gov/Pages/FOIA-Resources.aspx;* or

(3) By email to *foiaappeal@osc.gov,* or other electronic means as described on the FOIA page of OSC's Web site, *https://osc.gov/Pages/FOIA-Resources.aspx.*

(b) *Submission and content.* The appeal must be received by the Office of General Counsel within 45 days of the date of the letter denying the request. For the quickest possible handling, the appeal letter and envelope or any fax cover sheet should be clearly marked “FOIA Appeal.” The appeal letter must clearly identify the OSC determination (including the assigned FOIA request number, if known) being appealed. An appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes a matter of FOIA litigation.

(c) *Responses to appeals.* The agency decision on an appeal will be made in writing. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or in part shall inform the requester of the provisions for judicial review of that decision. If the adverse determination is reversed or modified on appeal, in whole or in part, the requester will be notified in a written decision and the request will be reprocessed in accordance with that appeal decision.
