(b) *Prohibition on employee's spouse or minor child seeking, obtaining, or renegotiating credit or indebtedness.* The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to the spouse or minor child of an employee unless:

(1) The credit or indebtedness is supported only by the income or independent means of the spouse or minor child;

(2) The credit or indebtedness is obtained on terms and conditions no more favorable than those offered to the general public; and

(3) The employee does not participate in the negotiation for the credit or indebtedness or serve as co-maker, endorser, or guarantor of the credit or indebtedness.

(c) *Disqualification requirement for credit sought by person related to an employee.* An employee shall disqualify himself or herself from participating in a particular matter involving specific parties as soon as he or she learns that any of the following persons are seeking, obtaining, or renegotiating credit or indebtedness with an entity that is or represents a party to the matter:

(1) The employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child;

(2) A partnership in which the employee or the employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child is a general partner;

(2) Overdraft protection on checking accounts and similar accounts at insured depository institutions or insured credit unions on terms and conditions no more favorable than those offered to the general public.

(e) *Waivers.* The DAEO, after consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may grant a written waiver from the prohibition in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section or the disqualification requirement in paragraph (c) of this section, based on a determination that participation in matters otherwise prohibited by this section would not be prohibited by law (18 U.S.C. 208) or create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain, and would not otherwise be inconsistent with the OGE Standards or the CFPB Ethics Regulations.
