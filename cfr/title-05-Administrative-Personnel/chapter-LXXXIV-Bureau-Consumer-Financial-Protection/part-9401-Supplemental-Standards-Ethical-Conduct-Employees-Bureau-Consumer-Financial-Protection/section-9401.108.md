(a) *Prohibition on employee seeking, obtaining, or renegotiating credit or indebtedness.* (1) While an employee is assigned to participate in a particular matter involving specific parties, the employee shall not seek, obtain, or renegotiate credit or indebtedness with an entity that is or represents a party to the matter. This prohibition also applies to a particular matter involving specific parties pending at the Bureau in which the employee is not currently participating but of which the employee is aware and believes it is likely that he or she will participate.

(2) The prohibition in paragraph (a)(1) of this section continues for two years after the employee's participation in the particular matter has ended.

(b) *Prohibition on employee's spouse or minor child seeking, obtaining, or renegotiating credit or indebtedness.* The prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to the spouse or minor child of an employee unless:

(1) The credit or indebtedness is supported only by the income or independent means of the spouse or minor child;

(2) The credit or indebtedness is obtained on terms and conditions no more favorable than those offered to the general public; and

(3) The employee does not participate in the negotiation for the credit or indebtedness or serve as co-maker, endorser, or guarantor of the credit or indebtedness.

(c) *Disqualification requirement for credit sought by person related to an employee.* An employee shall disqualify himself or herself from participating in a particular matter involving specific parties as soon as he or she learns that any of the following persons are seeking, obtaining, or renegotiating credit or indebtedness with an entity that is or represents a party to the matter:

(1) The employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child;

(2) A partnership in which the employee or the employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child is a general partner;

(3) A partnership or closely held corporation in which the employee or the employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child individually or jointly owns or controls more than a 10 percent equity interest;

(4) A trust in which the employee or the employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child has a legal or beneficial interest;

(5) An investment club or similar informal investment arrangement between the employee or the employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child, and others;

(6) A qualified profit sharing, retirement, or similar plan in which the employee or the employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child has an interest; or

(7) An entity in which the employee or the employee's spouse, domestic partner, or dependent child individually or jointly holds more than a 25 percent equity interest.

(d) *Exemptions.* The following forms of credit are exempted from the prohibition in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the disqualification requirement in paragraph (c) of this section:

(1) Revolving consumer credit or charge cards issued by insured depository institutions or insured credit unions on terms and conditions no more favorable than those offered to the general public; and

(2) Overdraft protection on checking accounts and similar accounts at insured depository institutions or insured credit unions on terms and conditions no more favorable than those offered to the general public.

(e) *Waivers.* The DAEO, after consultation with senior management in the Division in which the employee works, may grant a written waiver from the prohibition in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section or the disqualification requirement in paragraph (c) of this section, based on a determination that participation in matters otherwise prohibited by this section would not be prohibited by law (18 U.S.C. 208) or create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain, and would not otherwise be inconsistent with the OGE Standards or the CFPB Ethics Regulations.
