For purposes of this paragraph, a “covered entity” is a person for whom the employee is aware the employee's spouse, domestic partner, fiancé, child, parent, sibling, or member of the employee's household is serving or seeking to serve as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, agent, attorney, consultant, contractor, or employee.

(b) The DAEO may authorize the employee to participate in the matter using the authorization process set forth in 5 CFR 2635.502(d) of the OGE Standards. The DAEO will consult with senior management in the Division in which the employee works before issuing such an authorization.
