(i) Any company that owns or controls and has more than two percent of its assets directly invested in or dervices more than two percent of its income directly from a for-hire transportation company whether or not subject to the Interstate Commerce Act; or

(ii) Any company, mutual fund or other enterprise which has an interest of more than ten percent of its assets directly invested in or derives more than ten percent of its income directly from for-hire transportation companies whether or not subject to the Interstate Commerce Act.
