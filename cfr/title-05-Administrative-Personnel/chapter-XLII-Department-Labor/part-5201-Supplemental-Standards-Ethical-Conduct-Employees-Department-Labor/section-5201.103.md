##### § 5201.103 Fundraising activities. #####

Notwithstanding 5 CFR 2635.808(c)(1)(i), an employee of any separate agency component listed in this section may, in a personal capacity, personally solicit funds from a person who is a prohibited source if person is a prohibited source for employees of the component only under 5 CFR 2635.203(d)(3) because the person conducts activities regulated by the component:

(a) The Wage and Hour Division;

(b) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs;

(c) The Remainder of the Employment Standards Administration, as defined in § 5201.102(c);

(d) Occupational Safety and Health Administration;

(e) Employee Benefits Security Administration;

(f) Veterans' Employment and Training Service; and

(g) The Remainder of the Department of Labor, as defined in § 5201.102(c).

Example 1:A training official in the Mine Safety and Health Administration is president of the local branch of her college alumni association. The association is seeking used computers from local businesses to upgrade the college's language lab. The employee may not seek a contribution from the vice president of a mining company which is regulated by MSHA. Even though the mining company is not currently under investigation, it is a prohibited source for the employment because it is subject to MSHA regulation and MSHA is not one of the agency components designated as separate for the purpose of fundraising in a personal capacity.Example 2:A typist in the Employee Benefits Security Administration raises money for a local homeless shelter during his off-duty hours. He may seek a contribution from a firm that is regulated by EBSA under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act but may not seek contributions from one that he knows is currently under investigation for a violation of the Act. While firms regulated by an agency would ordinarily be prohibited sources for purposes of an employee's fundraising in a personal capacity, § 5201.103 provides that employees of EBSA and the other separate agency components listed in that section may seek charitable contributions from an entity that is a prohibited source only because its activities are subject to regulation by that separate agency component. On the other hand, the employee may not engage in fundraising from a person who he knows is a prohibited source for any other reason, such as an ongoing enforcement action.Example 3:An employee of the Employment and Training Administration may seek charitable contributions from a firm currently under investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). ETA does not regulate this firm and has had no dealings or business with it of any kind. Since ETA has been designated as a separate agency under § 5201.102, ETA employees need only consider their own official duties and activities and those of ETA in determining whether a person is a prohibited source for purposes of their fundraising in a personal capacity. The fact that a person may be a prohibited source of direct and indirect gifts for OSHA employees is not relevant in this instance.[61 FR 57284, Nov. 6, 1996, as amended at 68 FR 16398, Apr. 3, 2003]
