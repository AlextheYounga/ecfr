##### § 1605.2 Calculating, posting, and charging breakage on late contributions and loan payments. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 31676, May 24, 2022.

(a) The TSP will calculate breakage on late contributions, makeup agency contributions, and loan payments as described by § 1605.15(b). This breakage calculation is subject to the following rules:

(1) The TSP will not calculate breakage if contributions or loan payments are posted within 30 days of the “as of” date, or if the total amount on a late payment record or the total agency contributions on a current payment record is less than $1.00; and

(2) The TSP will not take the participant's interfund transfers into account when determining breakage.

(b) *Calculating breakage.* The TSP will calculate breakage as follows:

(1) For contributions or loan payments with “as of” dates on or after January 1, 2000, the TSP will:

(i) Use the participant's contribution allocation on file for the “as of” date to determine how the funds would have been invested. If there is no contribution allocation on file, or one cannot be derived based on the investment of contributions, the TSP will consider the funds to have been invested in the default investment fund in effect for the participant on the “as of” date.

(ii) Determine the number of shares of the applicable investment funds the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time. If the “as of” date is before TSP account balances were converted to shares, this determination will be the number of shares the participant would have received on the conversion date, and will include the monthly earnings the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on the “as of” date; and

(iii) Determine the dollar value on the posting date of the number of shares the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time. If the contributions or loan payments would have been invested in a Lifecycle fund that is retired on the posting date, the constructed share price shall equal the final posted share price of the retired Lifecycle fund, multiplied by the current L Income Fund share price, divided by the L Income Fund share price on the same date that the retired Lifecycle fund posted its final share price. The dollar value shall be the number of shares the participant would have received had the contributions or loan payments been made on time multiplied by the constructed share price.

(iv) The difference between the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the posting date and the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the “as of” date is the breakage.

(2) For contributions and loan payments with an “as of” date before January 1, 2000, the TSP will:

(i) Value the contributions and loan payments from the “as of” date through the date TSP accounts were converted to shares, by using the greater of either the G Fund monthly rate of return or the average monthly rate of return for all TSP Funds;

(ii) Determine the number of shares the participant would have received at conversion; and

(iii) Determine the dollar value of those shares on the posting date by using the greater of either the G Fund share price or the average share price for all of the TSP Funds. The difference between the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the posting date and the dollar value of the contribution or loan payment on the “as of” date is the breakage.

(c) *Posting contributions and loan payments.* Makeup and late contributions, late loan payments, and breakage, will be posted to the participant's account according to his or her contribution allocation on file for the posting date. If there is no contribution allocation on file for the posting date, they will be posted to the default investment fund in effect for the participant.

(d) *Charging breakage.* If the dollar amount posted to the participant's account is greater than the dollar amount of the makeup or late contribution or late loan payment, the TSP will charge the agency the additional amount. If the dollar amount posted to the participant's account is less than the dollar amount of the makeup or late contribution, or late loan payment, the difference between the amount of the contribution and the amount posted will be forfeited to the TSP.

(e) *Posting of multiple contributions.* If the TSP posts multiple makeup or late contributions or late loan payments with different “as of” dates for a participant on the same business day, the amount of breakage charged to the employing agency or forfeited to the TSP will be determined separately for each transaction, without netting any gains or losses attributable to different “as of” dates. In addition, gains and losses from different sources of contributions or different TSP Funds will not be netted against each other. Instead, breakage will be determined separately for each as-of date, TSP Fund, and source of contributions.
