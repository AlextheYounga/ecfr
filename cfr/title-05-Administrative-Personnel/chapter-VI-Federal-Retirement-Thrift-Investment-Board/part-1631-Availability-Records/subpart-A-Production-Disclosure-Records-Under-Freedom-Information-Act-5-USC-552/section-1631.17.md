##### ยง 1631.17 Deletion of exempted information. #####

Where requested records contain matters which are exempted under 5 U.S.C. 552(b) but which matters are reasonably segregable from the remainder of the records, they shall be disclosed by the Board with deletions. To each such record, the Board shall attach a written justification for making deletions. A single such justification shall suffice for deletions made in a group of similar or related records.
