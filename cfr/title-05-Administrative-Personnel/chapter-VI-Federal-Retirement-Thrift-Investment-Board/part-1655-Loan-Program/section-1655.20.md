(a) A residential loan will be made only for the purchase or construction of the primary residence of the participant, or for the participant and his or her spouse, and for related purchase costs. The participant must actually bear all or part of the cost of the purchase. If the participant purchases a primary residence with someone other than his or her spouse, only the portion of the purchase costs that is borne by the participant will be considered in making the loan. A residential loan will not be made for the purpose of paying off an existing mortgage or otherwise providing financing for a primary residence purchased more than 2 years before the date of the loan application.

(b) The participant's primary residence is his or her principal residence. A primary residence may include a house, a townhouse, a condominium, a share in a cooperative housing corporation, a mobile home, a boat, or a recreational vehicle; a primary residence does not include a second home or vacation home. A participant cannot have more than one primary residence.

(c) Purchase of a primary residence means acquisition of the residence through the exchange of cash or other property or through the total construction of a new residence. A residential loan will not be made for a lease-to-buy option, unless the option to buy is being exercised. Construction of an addition to or the renovation of a residence or the purchase of land only does not constitute the purchase of a primary residence.

(d) Related purchase costs are any costs that are incurred directly as a result of the purchase or construction of a residence and which can be added to the basis of the residence for Federal tax purposes. Points or loan origination fees charged for a loan, whether or not they are treated as part of the basis, are not considered a purchase cost. Real estate taxes cannot be included.

(e) The documentation required for a loan under this section is as follows:

(1) For all purchases, except for construction, a copy of a home purchase contract or a settlement sheet; or

(2) For construction, a home construction contract. If a single home construction contract is unavailable, other contracts, building permits, receipts, assessments, or other documentation that demonstrates the construction of an entire primary residence and expenses in the amount of the loan may be accepted at the discretion of the Executive Director.

(f) The documentation provided under this section must:

(1) Be from a third party;

(2) Show the participant as the purchaser or builder;

(3) Show the purchase price or construction price;

(4) Show the full address of the residence; and

(5) Bear a date that is no more than 24 months preceding the expiration date of the loan agreement.
