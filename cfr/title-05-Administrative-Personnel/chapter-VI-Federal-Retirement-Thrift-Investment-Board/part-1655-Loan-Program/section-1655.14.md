##### § 1655.14 Loan payments. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 31693, May 24, 2022.

(a) Loan payments must be made through payroll deduction in accordance with the loan agreement. Once loan payments begin, the employing agency cannot terminate the payroll deductions at the employee's request, unless the TSP instructs it to do so.

(b) The participant may make additional payments by mailing a personal check or guaranteed funds to the TSP record keeper. If the TSP receives a payment that repays the outstanding loan amount and overpays the loan by $10.00 or more, the overpayment will be refunded to the participant. Overpayments of less than $10 will be applied to the participant's account and will not be refunded. If a loan overpayment refund is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt to locate the participant. If the participant does not respond within 60 days, the TSP will forfeit the overpayment refund to the Plan. The participant can claim the forfeited funds, although they will not be credited with TSP investment fund returns.

(c) The initial payment on a loan is due on or before the 60th day following the loan issue date. Interest accrues on the loan from the date of issuance.

(d) Subsequent payments are due at regular intervals as prescribed in the loan agreement, or most recent amortization, according to the participant's pay cycle.

(e) If a payment is not made when due, the TSP will notify the participant of the missed payment and the participant must make up the payment in full. If the participant does not make up all missed payments by the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the first payment was missed, the TSP will declare the loan to be a taxable distribution in accordance with § 1655.15. The participant's make-up payment must be in the form of a personal check or guaranteed funds.

(f) Interest will accrue on all missed payments and will be included in the calculation of any taxable distribution subsequently declared in accordance with § 1655.15. Interest will also accrue on payments missed while a participant is in nonpay status.
