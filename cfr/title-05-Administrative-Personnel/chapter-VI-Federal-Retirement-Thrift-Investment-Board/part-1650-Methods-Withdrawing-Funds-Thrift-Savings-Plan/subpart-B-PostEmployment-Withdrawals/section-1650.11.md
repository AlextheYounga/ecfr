##### ยง 1650.11 Withdrawal elections. #####

(a) Subject to the restrictions in this subpart, participants may elect to withdraw all or a portion of their TSP accounts in a single payment, a series of monthly payments, a life annuity, or any combination of these options.

(b) If a participant's account balance is less than $5.00 when he or she separates from Government service, the balance will automatically be forfeited to the TSP. The participant can reclaim the money by writing to the TSP record keeper and requesting the amount that was forfeited; however, TSP investment earnings will not be credited to the account after the date of the forfeiture.

(c) If a participant's vested account balance is less than $200 when he or she separates from Government service, the TSP will automatically pay the balance to the participant at his or her TSP address of record. The participant will not be eligible for any other payment option or be allowed to remain in the TSP.
