Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 46422, Sept. 4, 2019.

To request an age-based withdrawal, a participant must submit to the TSP record keeper a properly completed paper TSP age-based withdrawal request form or use the TSP Web site to initiate a request. A participant's ability to complete an age-based withdrawal on the Web will depend on his or her retirement system coverage, marital status, and whether or not all or part of the withdrawal will be transferred to an eligible employer plan, traditional IRA, or Roth IRA.
