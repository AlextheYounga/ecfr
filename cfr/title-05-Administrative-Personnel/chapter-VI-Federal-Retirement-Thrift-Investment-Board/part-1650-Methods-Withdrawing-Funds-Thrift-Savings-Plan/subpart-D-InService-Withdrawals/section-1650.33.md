##### ยง 1650.33 Contributing to the TSP after an in-service withdrawal. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 31684, May 24, 2022.

(a) *Age-Based In-Service Withdrawals.* A participant's TSP contribution election will not be affected by an age-based in-service withdrawal; therefore, his or her TSP contributions will continue without interruption.

(b) *Financial Hardship In-Service Withdrawals.* (1) A participant who obtains a financial hardship in-service withdrawal prior to September 15, 2019, may not contribute to the TSP until the earlier of:

(i) The end of the six-month period after the withdrawal is processed, or

(ii) September 15, 2019.

(2) Therefore, the participant's employing agency will discontinue his or her contributions (and any applicable Agency Matching Contributions) for the applicable period after the agency is notified by the TSP; in the case of a FERS or BRS participant, Agency Automatic (1%) Contributions will continue. A participant whose TSP contributions are discontinued by his or her agency after a financial hardship withdrawal can resume contributions any time after expiration of the applicable period by submitting a new TSP contribution election. Contributions will not resume automatically.

(3) A participant's TSP contribution election will not be affected by a financial hardship in-service withdrawal obtained on or after September 15, 2019; therefore, his or her TSP contributions will continue without interruption.
