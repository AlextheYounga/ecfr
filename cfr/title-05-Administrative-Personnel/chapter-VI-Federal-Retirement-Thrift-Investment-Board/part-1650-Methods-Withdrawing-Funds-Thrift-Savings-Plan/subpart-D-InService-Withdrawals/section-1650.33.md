##### ยง 1650.33 Contributing to the TSP after an in-service withdrawal. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 60105, Dec. 19, 2017.

(a) A participant's TSP contribution election will not be affected by an age-based in-service withdrawal; therefore, his or her TSP contributions will continue without interruption.

(b) A participant who obtains a financial hardship in-service withdrawal may not contribute to the TSP for a period of six months after the withdrawal is processed. Therefore, the participant's employing agency will discontinue his or her contributions (and any applicable agency matching contributions) for six months after the agency is notified by the TSP; in the case of a FERS participant, agency automatic (1%) contributions will continue. A participant whose TSP contributions are discontinued by his or her agency after a financial hardship withdrawal can resume contributions any time after expiration of the six-month period by submitting a new TSP contribution election. Contributions will not resume automatically.
