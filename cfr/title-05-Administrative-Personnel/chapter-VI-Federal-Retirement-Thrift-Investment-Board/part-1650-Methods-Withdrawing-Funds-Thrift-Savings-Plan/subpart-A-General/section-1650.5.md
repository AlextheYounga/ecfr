If a withdrawal is returned as undeliverable, the TSP record keeper will attempt to locate the participant. If the participant does not respond within 60 days, the TSP will forfeit the returned funds to the Plan. The participant can claim the forfeited funds, although they will not be credited with TSP investment fund returns.
