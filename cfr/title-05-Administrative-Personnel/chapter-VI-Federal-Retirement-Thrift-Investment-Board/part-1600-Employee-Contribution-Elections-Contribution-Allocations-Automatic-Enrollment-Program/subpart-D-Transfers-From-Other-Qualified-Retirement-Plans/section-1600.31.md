##### § 1600.31 Methods for transferring eligible rollover distribution to the TSP. #####

(a) *Trustee-to-trustee transfer.* (1) A participant may request that the administrator or trustee of an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA transfer any or all of his or her account directly to the TSP by executing and submitting the appropriate TSP form to the administrator or trustee. The administrator or trustee must complete the appropriate section of the form and forward the completed form and the distribution to the TSP record keeper or the Agency must receive sufficient evidence from which to reasonably conclude that a contribution is a valid rollover contribution (as defined by 26 CFR 1.401(a)(31)-1, Q&A-14). By way of example, sufficient evidence to conclude a contribution is a valid rollover contribution includes a copy of the plan's determination letter, a letter or other statement from the plan administrator or trustee indicating that it is an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA, a check indicating that the contribution is a direct rollover, or a tax notice from the plan to the participant indicating that the participant could receive a rollover from the plan.

(2) If the distribution is from a Roth account maintained by an eligible employer plan, the plan administrator must also provide to the TSP a statement indicating the first year of the participant's Roth 5 year non-exclusion period under the distributing plan and either:

(i) The portion of the trustee-to-trustee transfer amount that represents Roth contributions (*i.e.* basis); or

(ii) A statement that the entire amount of the trustee-to-trustee transfer is a qualified Roth distribution (as defined by Internal Revenue Code section 402A(d)(2))

(b) *Rollover by participant.* A participant who has already received a distribution from an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA may roll over all or part of the distribution into the TSP. However, the TSP will not accept a rollover by the participant of Roth funds distributed from an eligible employer plan. A distribution of Roth funds from an eligible employer plan may be rolled into the TSP by trustee-to-trustee transfer only. The TSP will accept a rollover by the participant of tax-deferred amounts if the following requirements and conditions are satisfied:

(1) The participant must complete the appropriate TSP form.

(2) The administrator or trustee must either complete the appropriate section of the form and forward the completed form and the distribution to the TSP record keeper or the Agency must receive sufficient evidence from which to reasonably conclude that a contribution is a valid rollover contribution. By way of example, sufficient evidence to conclude a contribution is a valid rollover contribution includes a copy of the plan's determination letter, a letter or other statement from the plan indicating that it is an eligible employer plan or traditional IRA, a check indicating that the contribution is a direct rollover, or a tax notice from the plan to the participant indicating that the participant could receive a rollover from the plan.

(3) The participant must submit the completed TSP form, together with a certified check, cashier's check, cashier's draft, money order, treasurer's check from a credit union, or personal check, made out to the “Thrift Savings Plan,” for the entire amount of the rollover. A participant may roll over the full amount of the distribution by making up, from his or her own funds, the amount that was withheld from the distribution for the payment of Federal taxes.

(4) The transaction must be completed within 60 days of the participant's receipt of the distribution from his or her eligible employer plan or traditional IRA. The transaction is not complete until the TSP record keeper receives the appropriate TSP form, executed by the participant and administrator, trustee, or custodian, together with the guaranteed funds for the amount to be rolled over.

(c) *Participant's certification.* When transferring a distribution to the TSP by either a trustee-to-trustee transfer or a rollover, the participant must certify that the distribution is eligible for transfer into the TSP, as follows:

(1) *Distribution from an eligible employer plan.* The participant must certify that the distribution:

(i) Is not one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made over the life expectancy of the participant (or the joint lives of the participant and designated beneficiary, if applicable) or for a period of 10 years or more;

(ii) Is not a minimum distribution required by I.R.C. section 401(a)(9) (26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9));

(iii) Is not a hardship distribution;

(iv) Is not a plan loan that is deemed to be a taxable distribution because of default;

(v) Is not a return of excess elective deferrals; and

(vi) If not transferred or rolled over, would be includible in gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is paid. This paragraph shall not apply to Roth funds distributed from an eligible employer plan.

(2) *Distribution from a traditional IRA.* The participant must certify that the distribution:

(i) Is not a minimum distribution required under I.R.C. section 401(a)(9) (26 U.S.C. 401(a)(9)); and

(ii) If not transferred or rolled over, would be includible in gross income for the tax year in which the distribution is paid.
