(2) With respect to any alien who has obtained the status of an alien lawfully admitted for temporary residence pursuant to section 210A of the Act only, assistance furnished under the Legal Services Corporation Act (42 U.S.C. 2996, *et seq.*) or title V of the Housing Act of 1949 (42 U.S.C. l471 *et seq.*) shall not be construed to be financial assistance referred to in § 245a.5(a).

(3) Section 245a.5(a) shall not apply to benefits financed through the programs identified in § 245a.5(c), which are marked with an asterisk (\*), except to the extent that such benefits:
