##### § 102-34.335 How do I submit information to the General Services Administration (GSA) for the Federal Fleet Report (FFR)? #####

(a) Annually, agencies must submit to GSA the information needed to produce the FFR through the Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST), an Internet-based reporting tool. To find out how to submit motor vehicle data to GSA through FAST, consult the instructions from your agency fleet manager and read the documentation at *http://fastweb.inel.gov/.*

(b) Specific reporting categories, by agency, included in the FFR are—

(1) Inventory;

(2) Acquisitions;

(3) Operating costs;

(4) Miles traveled; and

(5) Fuel used.

Note to § 102-34.335:

The FAST system is also used by agency Fleet Managers to provide the Department of Energy with information required by the Energy Policy Act and related Executive Orders. In addition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires agency Fleet Managers and budget officers to submit annual agency motor vehicle budgeting information to OMB through FAST (see OMB Circular A-11, Preparation, Submission, and Execution of the Budget).
