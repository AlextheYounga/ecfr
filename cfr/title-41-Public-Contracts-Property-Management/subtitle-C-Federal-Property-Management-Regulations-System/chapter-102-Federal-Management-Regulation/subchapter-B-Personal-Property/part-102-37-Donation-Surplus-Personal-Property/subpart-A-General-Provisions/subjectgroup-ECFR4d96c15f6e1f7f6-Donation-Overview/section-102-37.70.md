##### ยง 102-37.70 How should a transferee account for the receipt of a larger or smaller number of items than approved by GSA on the SF 123? #####

When the quantity of property received doesn't agree with that approved by GSA on the SF 123, the transferee should handle the overage or shortage as follows:
