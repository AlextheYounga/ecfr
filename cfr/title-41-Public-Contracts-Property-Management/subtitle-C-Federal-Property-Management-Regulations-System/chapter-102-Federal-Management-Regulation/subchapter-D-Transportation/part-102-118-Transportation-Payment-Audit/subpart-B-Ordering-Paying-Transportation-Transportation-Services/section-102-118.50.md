##### ยง 102-118.50 How does my agency pay for transportation services? #####

Your agency may pay for transportation services in three ways:

(a) *Electronic funds transfer (EFT) (31 U.S.C. 3332, et).* Your agency is required by statute to make all payments by EFT unless your agency receives a waiver from the Department of the Treasury.

(b) *Check.* For those situations where EFT is not possible and the Department of the Treasury has issued a waiver, your agency may make payments by check.

(c) *Cash.* In very unusual circumstances and as a last option, your agency payments may be made in cash in accordance with Department of the Treasury regulations (31 CFR part 208).
