##### § 102-118.170 Will GSA continue to maintain a centralized numbering system for Government transportation documents? #####

Yes, GSA will maintain a numbering system for GBLs and GTRs. For commercial TDs, each agency must create a unique numbering system to account for and prevent duplicate numbers. The GSA Audit Division must approve this system. Write to:
