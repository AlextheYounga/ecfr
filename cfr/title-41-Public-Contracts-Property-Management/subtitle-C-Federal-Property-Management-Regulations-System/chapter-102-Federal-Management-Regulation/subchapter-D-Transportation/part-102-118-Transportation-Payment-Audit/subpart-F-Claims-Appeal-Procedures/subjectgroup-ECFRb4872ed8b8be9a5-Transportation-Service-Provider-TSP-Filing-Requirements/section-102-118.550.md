##### ยง 102-118.550 How does a TSP file an administrative claim using EDI or other electronic means? #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 32326, May 31, 2022.

The medium and precise format of data for an administrative claim filed electronically must be approved in advance by the GSA Audit Division. GSA will use an authenticating EDI signature to certify receipt of the claim. The data on the claim must contain proof of the delivery of goods, and an itemized bill reflecting the services provided, with the lowest charges available for service. The TSP must be able to locate, identify, and reproduce the records in readable form without loss of clarity.
