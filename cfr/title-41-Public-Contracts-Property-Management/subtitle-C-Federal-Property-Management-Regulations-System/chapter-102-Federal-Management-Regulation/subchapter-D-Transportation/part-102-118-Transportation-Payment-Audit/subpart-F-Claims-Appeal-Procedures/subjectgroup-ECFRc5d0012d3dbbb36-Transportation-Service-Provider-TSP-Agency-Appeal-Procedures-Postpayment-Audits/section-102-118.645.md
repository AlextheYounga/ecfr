##### § 102-118.645 Can a TSP file an administrative claim on collection actions? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 93198, Nov. 26, 2024.

Yes, a TSP may file an administrative claim involving collection actions resulting from the transportation audit performed by the GSA directly with the GSA Transportation Audits Division. Any claims submitted to GSA will be considered “disputed claims” under section 4(b) of the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, *et seq.*). The TSP must file all other transportation claims with the agency out of whose activities they arose. If this is not feasible (*e.g.,* where the responsible agency cannot be determined or is no longer in existence) claims may be sent to the GSA Transportation Audits Division for forwarding to the responsible agency or for direct settlement by the GSA Transportation Audits Division. Submit claims using Transportation Audits Management System (TAMS) at *https://tams.gsa.gov* or via mail: General Services Administration, Office of Travel, Employee Relocation and Transportation, Attn: Transportation Audits Division, 1800 F Street NW, 3rd Floor, Mail Hub 3400, Washington, DC 20405.
