##### § 102-118.645 Can a TSP file an administrative claim on collection actions? #####

Yes, a TSP may file an administrative claim involving collection actions resulting from the transportation audit performed by the GSA directly with the GSA Audit Division. Any claims submitted to GSA will be considered “disputed claims” under section 4(b) of the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3901, *et seq.*). The TSP must file all other transportation claims with the agency out of whose activities they arose. If this is not feasible (e.g., where the responsible agency cannot be determined or is no longer in existence) claims may be sent to the GSA Audit Division for forwarding to the responsible agency or for direct settlement by the GSA Audit Division. Claims for GSA processing must be addressed to:
