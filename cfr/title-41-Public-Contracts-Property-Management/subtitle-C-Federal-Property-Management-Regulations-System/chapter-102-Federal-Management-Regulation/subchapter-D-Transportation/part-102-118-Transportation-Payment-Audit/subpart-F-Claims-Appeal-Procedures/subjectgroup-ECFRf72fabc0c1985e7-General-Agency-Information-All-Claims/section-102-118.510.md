##### ยง 102-118.510 Can my agency revise or alter a GSA Form 7931, Certificate of Settlement? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 93197, Nov. 26, 2024.

Generally, no, an agency must not revise or alter amounts on a GSA Form 7931. The only change an agency can make to a GSA Form 7931 is to change the agency financial data to a correct cite. Any GSA Form 7931 that cannot be paid (e.g., an amount previously paid), must be immediately returned to the GSA Transportation Audits Division with an explanation.
