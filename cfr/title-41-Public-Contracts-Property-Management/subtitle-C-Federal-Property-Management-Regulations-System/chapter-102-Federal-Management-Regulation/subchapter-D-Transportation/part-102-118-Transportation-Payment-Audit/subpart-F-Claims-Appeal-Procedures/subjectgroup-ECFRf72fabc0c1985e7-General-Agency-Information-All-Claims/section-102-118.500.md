##### ยง 102-118.500 How does my agency handle a voluntary refund submitted by a TSP? #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 32325, May 31, 2022.

(a) An agency must report all voluntary refunds to the GSA Audit Division (so that no Notice of Overcharge or financial offset occurs), unless other arrangements are made (e.g., charge card refunds, etc.). These reports must be addressed to:

General Services AdministrationFederal Supply ServiceAudit Division (FBA)Code: CC1800 F Street, NW.Washington, DC 20405*www.gsa.gov/transaudits*

(b) Once a Notice of Overcharge is issued by the GSA Audit Division, then any refund is no longer considered voluntary and the agency must forward the refund to the GSA Audit Division.
