Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 32326, May 31, 2022.

The Director of the GSA Audit Division has the authority and responsibility to audit and settle all transportation related accounts (31 U.S.C. 3726). The reason for this is that he or she has access to Governmentwide data on a TSP's payments and billings with the Government. Your agency has the responsibility to correctly pay individual transportation claims.
