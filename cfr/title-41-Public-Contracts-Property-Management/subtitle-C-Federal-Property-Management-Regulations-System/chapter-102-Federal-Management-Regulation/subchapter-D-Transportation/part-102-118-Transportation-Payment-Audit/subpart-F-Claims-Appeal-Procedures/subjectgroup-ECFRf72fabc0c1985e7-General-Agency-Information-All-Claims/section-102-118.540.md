Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 93197, Nov. 26, 2024.

The Director of the GSA Transportation Audits Division has the authority and responsibility to audit and settle all transportation related accounts (31 U.S.C. 3726). The reason for this is that he or she has access to Governmentwide data on a TSP's payments and billings with the Government. Your agency has the responsibility to correctly pay individual transportation claims.
