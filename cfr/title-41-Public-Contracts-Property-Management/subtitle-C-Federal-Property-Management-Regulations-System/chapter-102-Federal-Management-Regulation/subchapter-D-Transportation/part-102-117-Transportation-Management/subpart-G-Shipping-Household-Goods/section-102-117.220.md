(a) You may choose to ship HHG by:

(1) Using the commuted rate system;

(2) GSA's Centralized Household Goods Traffic Management Program (CHAMP);

(3) Contracting directly with a TSP, (including a relocation company that offers transportation services) using the acquisition procedures under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (see § 102-117.35);

(4) Using another agency's contract with a TSP (see §§ 102-117.40 and 102-117.45);

(5) Using a rate tender under the Federal transportation procurement statutes (49 U.S.C. 10721 or 13712) (see § 102-117.35).

(b) As an alternative to the choices in paragraph (a) of this section, you may request the Department of State to assist with shipments of HHG moving to, from, and between foreign countries or international shipments originating in the continental United States.

Agencies must use the commuted rate system for civilian employees who transfer between points inside the continental United States unless it is evident from the cost comparison that the Government will incur a savings ($100 or more) using another choice listed. The use of household goods rate tenders is not authorized when household goods are shipped under the commuted rate system.
