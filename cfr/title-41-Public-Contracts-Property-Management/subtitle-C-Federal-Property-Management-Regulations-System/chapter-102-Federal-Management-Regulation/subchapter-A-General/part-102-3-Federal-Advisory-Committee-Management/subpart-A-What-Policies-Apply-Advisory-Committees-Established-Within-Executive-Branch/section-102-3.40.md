##### ยง 102-3.40 What types of committees or groups are not covered by the Act and this part? #####

The following are examples of committees or groups that are not covered by the Act or this Federal Advisory Committee Management part:

(a) *Committees created by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) or the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA).* Any committee created by NAS or NAPA in accordance with section 15 of the Act, except as otherwise covered by subpart E of this part;

(b) *Advisory committees of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Reserve System.* Any advisory committee established or utilized by the Central Intelligence Agency or the Federal Reserve System;

(c) *Committees exempted by statute.* Any committee specifically exempted from the Act by law;

(d) *Committees not actually managed or controlled by the executive branch.* Any committee or group created by non-Federal entities (such as a contractor or private organization), provided that these committees or groups are not actually managed or controlled by the executive branch;

(e) *Groups assembled to provide individual advice.* Any group that meets with a Federal official(s), including a public meeting, where advice is sought from the attendees on an individual basis and not from the group as a whole;

(f) *Groups assembled to exchange facts or information.* Any group that meets with a Federal official(s) for the purpose of exchanging facts or information;

(g) *Intergovernmental committees.* Any committee composed wholly of full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal Government and elected officers of State, local and tribal governments (or their designated employees with authority to act on their behalf), acting in their official capacities. However, the purpose of such a committee must be solely to exchange views, information, or advice relating to the management or implementation of Federal programs established pursuant to statute, that explicitly or inherently share intergovernmental responsibilities or administration (see guidelines issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on section 204(b) of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, 2 U.S.C. 1534(b), OMB Memorandum M-95-20, dated September 21, 1995, available from the Committee Management Secretariat (MC), General Services Administration, 1800 F Street, NW., Washington, DC 20405-0002);

(h) *Intragovernmental committees.* Any committee composed wholly of full-time or permanent part-time officers or employees of the Federal Government;

(i) *Local civic groups.* Any local civic group whose primary function is that of rendering a public service with respect to a Federal program;

(j) *Groups established to advise State or local officials.* Any State or local committee, council, board, commission, or similar group established to advise or make recommendations to State or local officials or agencies; and

(k) *Operational committees.* Any committee established to perform primarily operational as opposed to advisory functions. Operational functions are those specifically authorized by statute or Presidential directive, such as making or implementing Government decisions or policy. A committee designated operational may be covered by the Act if it becomes primarily advisory in nature. It is the responsibility of the administering agency to determine whether a committee is primarily operational. If so, it does not fall under the requirements of the Act and this part.
