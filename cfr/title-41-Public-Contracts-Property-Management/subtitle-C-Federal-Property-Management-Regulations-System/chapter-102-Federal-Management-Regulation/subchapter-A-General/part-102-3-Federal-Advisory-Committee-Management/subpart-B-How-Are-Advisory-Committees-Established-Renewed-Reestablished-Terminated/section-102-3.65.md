##### ยง 102-3.65 What are the public notification requirements for discretionary advisory committees? #####

A notice to the public in the Federal Register is required when a discretionary advisory committee is established, renewed, or reestablished.

(a) *Procedure.* Upon receiving notice from the Secretariat that its review is complete in accordance with ยง 102-3.60(a), the agency must publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the advisory committee is being established, renewed, or reestablished. For the establishment of a new advisory committee, the notice also must describe the nature and purpose of the advisory committee and affirm that the advisory committee is necessary and in the public interest.

(b) *Time required for notices.* Notices of establishment and reestablishment of advisory committees must appear at least 15 calendar days before the charter is filed, except that the Secretariat may approve less than 15 calendar days when requested by the agency for good cause. This requirement for advance notice does not apply to advisory committee renewals, notices of which may be published concurrently with the filing of the charter.
