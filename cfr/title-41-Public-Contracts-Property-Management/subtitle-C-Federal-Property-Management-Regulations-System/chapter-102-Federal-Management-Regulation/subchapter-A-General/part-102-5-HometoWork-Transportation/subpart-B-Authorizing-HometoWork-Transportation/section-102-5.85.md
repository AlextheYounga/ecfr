##### ยง 102-5.85 What information should our determination for field work include if positions are identified rather than named individuals? #####

If positions are identified rather than named individuals, your determination for field work should include sufficient information to satisfy an audit, if necessary. This information should include the job title, number, and operational level where the work is to be performed (e.g., five recruiter personnel or, positions at the Detroit Army Recruiting Battalion).

Note to ยง 102-5.85:

An agency head may elect to designate positions rather than individual names, especially in positions where rapid turnover occurs.
