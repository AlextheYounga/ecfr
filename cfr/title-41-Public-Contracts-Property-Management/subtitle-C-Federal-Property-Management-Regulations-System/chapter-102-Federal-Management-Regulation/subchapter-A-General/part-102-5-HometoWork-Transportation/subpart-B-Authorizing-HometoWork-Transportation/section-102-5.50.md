##### § 102-5.50 May determinations be made in advance for employees who respond to unusual circumstances when they arise? #####

Yes, determinations may be made in advance when the Federal agency wants to have employees ready to respond to:

(a) A clear and present danger;

(c) A compelling operational consideration.

Note to § 102-5.50:

Implementation of these determinations is contingent upon one of the three circumstances occurring. Thus, these may be referred to as “contingency determinations.”
