##### § 102-5.75 What circumstances do not establish a basis for authorizing home-to-work transportation for field work? #####

The following circumstances do not establish a basis for authorizing home-to-work transportation for field work:

(a) When an employee assigned to field work is not actually performing field work.

(b) When the employee's workday begins at his/her work; or

(c) When the employee normally commutes to a fixed location, however far removed from his/her official duty station (for example, auditors or investigators assigned to a defense contractor plant).

Note to § 102-5.75:

For instances where an employee is authorized home-to-work transportation under the field work provision, but performs field work only on an intermittent basis, the agency shall establish procedures to ensure that a Government passenger carrier is used only when field work is actually being performed. Although some employees' daily work station is not located in a Government office, these employees are not performing field work. Like all Government employees, employees working in a “field office” are responsible for their own commuting costs.
