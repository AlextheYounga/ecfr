##### § 102-173.25 What definitions apply to this part? #####

The following definitions apply to this part:

*Domain* is a region of jurisdiction on the Internet for naming assignment. The General Services Administration (GSA) is responsible for registrations in the dot-gov domain.

*Domain name* is a name assigned to an Internet server. This is the name that you request from GSA. Typically, you would apply this name to a domain name server. A domain name locates the organization or other entity on the Internet. The dot gov part of the domain name reflects the purpose of the organization or entity. This part is called the Top-Level Domain name. The Second-Level Domain name to the left of the dot gov maps to a readable version of the Internet address. The Domain Name server has a registry of Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers that relate to the readable text name.

*Domain name server* is the computer that provides pointers from the domain name to the actual computers.

*Dot-gov* refers to domain names ending with a “.gov” suffix. The Internet GOV domain is another way of expressing the collection of dot-gov domain names.

*Native Sovereign Nations (NSN)* are federally recognized tribes.
