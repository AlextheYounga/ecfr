##### ยง 102-83.110 When an agency's mission and program requirements call for the location in an urban area, are Executive agencies required to give first consideration to central business areas? #####

Yes, if an agency has a specific location need to be in an urban area, then Executive Orders 12072 and 13006 require that agencies should give first consideration to locating in a historic building in a historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies must give consideration to locating in a non-historic building in a historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies must give consideration to locating in a historic building outside of a historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area. If no such space is available, agencies should give consideration to locating in a non-historic building outside of a historic district in the CBA of a central city of the appropriate metropolitan area.
