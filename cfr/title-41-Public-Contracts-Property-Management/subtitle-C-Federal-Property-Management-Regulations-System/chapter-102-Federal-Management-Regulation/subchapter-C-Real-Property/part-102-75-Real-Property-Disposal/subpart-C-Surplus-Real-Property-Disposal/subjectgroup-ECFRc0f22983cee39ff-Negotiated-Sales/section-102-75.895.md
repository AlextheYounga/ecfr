Excess Profits Covenant for Negotiated Sales to Public Bodies

(a) This covenant shall run with the land for a period of 3 years from the date of conveyance. With respect to the property described in this deed, if at any time within a 3-year period from the date of transfer of title by the Grantor, the Grantee, or its successors or assigns, shall sell or enter into agreements to sell the property, either in a single transaction or in a series of transactions, it is covenanted and agreed that all proceeds received or to be received in excess of the Grantee's or a subsequent seller's actual allowable costs will be remitted to the Grantor. In the event of a sale of less than the entire property, actual allowable costs will be apportioned to the property based on a fair and reasonable determination by the Grantor.

(b) For purposes of this covenant, the Grantee's or a subsequent seller's allowable costs shall include the following:

(1) The purchase price of the real property.

(2) The direct costs actually incurred and paid for improvements that serve only the property, including road construction, storm and sanitary sewer construction, other public facilities or utility construction, building rehabilitation and demolition, landscaping, grading, and other site or public improvements.

(3) The direct costs actually incurred and paid for design and engineering services with respect to the improvements described in (b)(2) of this section.

(4) The finance charges actually incurred and paid in conjunction with loans obtained to meet any of the allowable costs enumerated above.

(c) None of the allowable costs described in paragraph (b) of this section will be deductible if defrayed by Federal grants or if used as matching funds to secure Federal grants.

(d) To verify compliance with the terms and conditions of this covenant, the Grantee, or its successors or assigns, shall submit an annual report for each of the subsequent 3 years to the Grantor on the anniversary date of this deed. Each report will identify the property involved in this transaction and will contain such of the following items of information as are applicable at the time of submission:

(1) A statement indicating whether or not a resale has been made.

(2) A description of each portion of the property that has been resold.

(3) The sale price of each such resold portion.

(4) The identity of each purchaser.

(5) The proposed land use.

(6) An enumeration of any allowable costs incurred and paid that would offset any realized profit.

(e) The Grantor may monitor the property and inspect records related thereto to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of this covenant and may take any actions that it deems reasonable and prudent to recover any excess profits realized through the resale of the property.
