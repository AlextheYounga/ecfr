##### ยง 102-75.1205 What action must be taken on approved applications? #####

(a) *Unutilized and underutilized properties.* (1) When HHS approves an application, it will so notify the applicant and forward a copy of the application to the landholding agency. The landholding agency will execute the lease, or permit document, as appropriate, in consultation with the applicant.

(2) The landholding agency maintains the discretion to decide the following:

(i) The length of time the property will be available. (Leases and permits will be for a period of at least one year, unless the applicant requests a shorter term.)

(ii) Whether to grant use of the property pursuant to a lease or permit.

(iii) The terms and conditions of the lease or permit document.

(b) *Excess and surplus properties.* (1) When HHS approves an application, it will so notify the applicant and request that GSA assign the property to HHS for leasing. Upon receipt of the assignment, HHS will execute a lease in accordance with the procedures and requirements set out in 45 CFR part 12. In accordance with ยง 102-75.965, custody and accountability of the property will remain throughout the lease term with the agency that initially reported the property as excess.

(2) Prior to assignment to HHS, GSA may consider other Federal uses and other important national needs; however, in deciding the disposition of surplus real property, GSA will generally give priority of consideration to uses to assist the homeless. GSA may consider any competing request for the property made under 40 U.S.C. 550 (education, health, public park or recreation, and historic monument uses) that is so meritorious and compelling that it outweighs the needs of the homeless, and HHS may likewise consider any competing request made under 40 U.S.C. 550(c) or (d) (education and health uses).

(3) Whenever GSA or HHS decides in favor of a competing request over a request for property for homeless assistance use as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the agency making the decision will transmit to the appropriate committees of the Congress an explanatory statement that details the need satisfied by conveyance of the surplus property, and the reasons for determining that such need was so meritorious and compelling as to outweigh the needs of the homeless.

(4) *Deeds.* Surplus property may be conveyed to representatives of the homeless pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 550, and section 501(f) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 11411. Representatives of the homeless must complete the application packet pursuant to the requirements of ยง 102-75.1200 and in accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR part 12.

(c) *Completion of lease term and reversion of title.* Lessees and grantees will be responsible for the protection and maintenance of the property during the time that they possess the property. Upon termination of the lease term or reversion of title to the Federal Government, the lessee or grantee will be responsible for removing any improvements made to the property and will be responsible for restoration of the property. If such improvements are not removed, they will become the property of the Federal Government. GSA or the landholding agency, as appropriate, will assume responsibility for protection and maintenance of a property when the lease terminates or title reverts.
