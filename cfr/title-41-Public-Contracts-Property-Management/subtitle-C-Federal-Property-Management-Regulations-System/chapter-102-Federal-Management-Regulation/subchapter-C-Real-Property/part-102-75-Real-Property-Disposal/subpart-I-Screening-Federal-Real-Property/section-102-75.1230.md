##### § 102-75.1230 How long does an agency have to indicate its interest in the property? #####

Generally, agencies have 30 days to express written interest in the property. However, sometimes GSA has cause to conduct an expedited screening of the real property and the time allotted for responding is less than 30 days. The Notice of Availability always contains a “respond by” date.
