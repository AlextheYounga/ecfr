##### ยง 102-84.40 What types of real property must I report for the Annual Real Property Inventory? #####

You must report for the Annual Real Property Inventory all land, buildings, and other structures and facilities owned by the United States (including wholly-owned Federal Government corporations) throughout the world, all real property leased by the United States from private individuals, organizations, and municipal, county, State, and foreign governments, and all real property otherwise managed by the United States where the ownership interest is held by a State or foreign government. Property to be reported includes, but is not limited to:

(a) Real property acquired by purchase, construction, donation, eminent domain proceedings, or any other method;

(b) Real property in which the Government has a long-term interest considered by the reporting agency as being equivalent to ownership. This would include land acquired by treaty or long-term lease (e.g., 99-year lease), and that your agency considers equivalent to Federally-owned land;

(c) Buildings or other structures and facilities owned by or leased to the Government, whether or not located on Government-owned land;

(d) Excess and surplus real property;

(e) Leased real property (including leased land, leased buildings, leased other structures and facilities, or any combination thereof);

(f) Real property leased rent free or for a nominal rental rate, if the real property is considered significant by the reporting agency; and

(g) Real property where title is held by a State or foreign government, but rights for use have been granted to a Federal entity in an arrangement other than a leasehold.
