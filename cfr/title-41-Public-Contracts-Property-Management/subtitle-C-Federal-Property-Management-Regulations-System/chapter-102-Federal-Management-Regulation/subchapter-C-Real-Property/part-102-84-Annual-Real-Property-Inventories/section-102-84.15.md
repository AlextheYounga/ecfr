##### ยง 102-84.15 Why must I provide information for the Annual Real Property Inventory? #####

You must provide information for the Annual Real Property Inventory because:

(a) The Senate Committee on Appropriations requests that the Government maintain an Annual Real Property Inventory.

(b) Executive Order 12411, Government Work Space Management Reforms, dated March 29, 1983 (48 FR 13391, 3 CFR, 1983 Comp., p. 155), requires that Executive agencies:

(1) Produce and maintain a total inventory of work space and related furnishings and declare excess to the Administrator of General Services all such holdings that are not necessary to satisfy existing or known and verified planned programs; and

(2) Establish information systems, implement inventory controls and conduct surveys, in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator of General Services, so that a governmentwide reporting system may be developed.

(c) Executive Order 13327, *Federal Real Property Asset Management*, dated February 4, 2004, requires that the Administrator of General Services, in consultation with the Federal Real Property Council, establish and maintain a single, comprehensive and descriptive database of all real property under the custody and control of all executive branch agencies, except when otherwise required for reasons of national security. The Executive Order authorizes the Administrator to collect from each Executive agency such descriptive information, except for classified information, as the Administrator considers will best describe the nature, use, and extent of the real property holdings of the Federal Government.
