##### ยง 102-82.20 What are Executive agencies' rate intervention responsibilities? #####

Where the consumer interests of the Federal Government will be significantly affected and upon receiving a delegation of authority from GSA, Executive agencies must provide representation in proceedings involving utility services before Federal and State regulatory bodies. Specifically, these responsibilities include instituting formal or informal action before Federal and State regulatory bodies to contest the level, structure, or applicability of rates or service terms of utility suppliers. The Secretary of Defense is independently authorized to take such actions without a delegation from GSA, when the Secretary determines such actions to be in the best interests of national security.
