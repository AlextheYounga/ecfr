##### § 102-81.20 Are the security standards for new Federally owned and leased facilities the same as the standards for existing Federally owned and leased facilities? #####

No, the minimum standards specified in the Department of Justice's June 28, 1995, study entitled “Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities” identifies the minimum-security standards that agencies must adhere to for all existing owned and leased Federal facilities. As specified in § 102-81.25, new Federally owned and leased facilities must be designed to meet the standards identified in the document entitled “Interagency Security Committee Security Design Criteria for New Federal Office Buildings and Major Modernization Projects,” dated May 28, 2001. The security design criteria for new facilities takes into consideration technology developments, new cost consideration, the experience of practitioners applying the criteria, and the need to balance security requirements with public building environments that remain lively, open, and accessible.
