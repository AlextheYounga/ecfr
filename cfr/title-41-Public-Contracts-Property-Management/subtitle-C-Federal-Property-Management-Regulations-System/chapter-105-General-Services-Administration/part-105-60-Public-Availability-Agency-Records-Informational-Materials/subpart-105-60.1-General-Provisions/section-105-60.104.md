##### ยง 105-60.104 Records of other agencies. #####

If GSA receives a request for access to records that are known to be the primary responsibility of another agency, GSA will refer the request to the agency concerned for appropriate action. For example, GSA will refer requests to the appropriate agency in cases in which GSA does not have sufficient knowledge of the action or matter that is the subject of the requested records to determine whether the records must be released or may be withheld under one of the exemptions listed in Subpart 105-60.5 of this part. If GSA does not have the requested records, the agency will attempt to determine whether the requested records exist at another agency and, if possible, will forward the request to that agency. GSA will inform the requester that GSA has forwarded the request to another agency.
