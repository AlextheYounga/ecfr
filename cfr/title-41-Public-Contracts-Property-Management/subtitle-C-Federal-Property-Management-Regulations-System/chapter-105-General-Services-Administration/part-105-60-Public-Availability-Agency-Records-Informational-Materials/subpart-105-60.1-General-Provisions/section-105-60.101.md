##### ยง 105-60.101 Purpose. #####

This part 105-60 implements the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. 552. The regulations in this part also implement Executive Order 12600, Predisclosure Notification Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information, of June 23, 1987 (3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 235). This part prescribes procedures by which the public may inspect and obtain copies of GSA records under the FOIA, including administrative procedures which must be exhausted before a requester invokes the jurisdiction of an appropriate United States District Court for GSA's failure to respond to a proper request within the statutory time limits, for a denial of agency records or challenge to the adequacy of a search, or for a denial of a fee waiver.
