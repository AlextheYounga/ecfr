(2) The need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are described in a single request;

(3) The need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of GSA having substantial subject-matter interest therein; or

(4) The need to consult with the submitter of the requested information.

(b) If necessary, GSA may take more than one extension of time. However, the total extension of time to respond to any single request shall not exceed 10 workdays. The extension may be divided between the initial and appeal stages or within a single stage. GSA will provide written notice to the requester of any extension of time limits.
