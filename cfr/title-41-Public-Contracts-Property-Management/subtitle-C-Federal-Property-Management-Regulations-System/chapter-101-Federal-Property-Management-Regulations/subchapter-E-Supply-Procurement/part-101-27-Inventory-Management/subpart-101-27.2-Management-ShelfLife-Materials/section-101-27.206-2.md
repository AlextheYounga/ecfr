##### § 101-27.206-2 Identification and shipping requirements. #####

Manufacturers shall, whenever practicable, be required to mark the unit or container with the month and year of manufacture or production and the batch number on all shelf-life items (60 months or less) procured from other than GSA sources. Whenever practical, the supplier shall be required to ship or deliver material within a given number of months from the date of manufacture or production. These “age on delivery” requirements should not be imposed in such a manner as to unduly restrict competition at any trade level. The following guidelines are suggested as appropriate for most shelf-life items:

|Shelf-life period|Age on delivery|
|-----------------|---------------|
| 25 mos. or more |    6 mos.     |
|  19 to 24 mos   |    4 mos.     |
|  13 to 18 mos   |    3 mos.     |
|   7 to 12 mos   |    2 mos.     |
| 6 mos. or less  |1 mo. or less. |
