*Essential job functions* - (1) *In general.* The term *essential job functions* means the fundamental job duties of the employment position an individual holds.

(2) A job function may be considered essential if:

(i) The access to compensation information is necessary in order to perform that function or another routinely assigned business task; or

(ii) The function or duties of the position include protecting and maintaining the privacy of employee personnel records, including compensation information.

(3) The application or interpretation of the “essential job functions” definition in this part is limited to the discrimination claims governed by Executive Order 13665 and its implementing regulations.

*Federally assisted construction contract* means any agreement or modification thereof between any applicant and a person for construction work which is paid for in whole or in part with funds obtained from the Government or borrowed on the credit of the Government pursuant to any Federal program involving a grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee, or undertaken pursuant to any Federal program involving such grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee, or any application or modification thereof approved by the Government for a grant, contract, loan, insurance, or guarantee under which the applicant itself participates in the construction work.

*Government* means the government of the United States of America.

*Government contract* means any agreement or modification thereof between any contracting agency and any person for the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services. The term “personal property,” as used in this section, includes supplies, and contracts for the use of real property (such as lease arrangements), unless the contract for the use of real property itself constitutes real property (such as easements). The term “nonpersonal services” as used in this section includes, but is not limited to, the following services: Utilities, construction, transportation, research, insurance, and fund depository. The term *Government contract* does not include:

(1) Agreements in which the parties stand in the relationship of employer and employee; and

(2) Federally assisted construction contracts.

*Internet Applicant.* (1) Internet Applicant means any individual as to whom the following four criteria are satisfied:

(i) The individual submits an expression of interest in employment through the Internet or related electronic data technologies;

(ii) The contractor considers the individual for employment in a particular position;

(iii) The individual's expression of interest indicates the individual possesses the basic qualifications for the position; and,

(iv) The individual at no point in the contractor's selection process prior to receiving an offer of employment from the contractor, removes himself or herself from further consideration or otherwise indicates that he or she is no longer interested in the position.

(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(i) of this definition, “submits an expression of interest in employment through the Internet or related electronic data technologies,” includes all expressions of interest, regardless of the means or manner in which the expression of interest is made, if the contractor considers expressions of interest made through the Internet or related electronic data technologies in the recruiting or selection processes for that particular position.

(i) Example A: Contractor A posts on its web site an opening for a Mechanical Engineer position and encourages potential applicants to complete an on-line profile if they are interested in being considered for that position. The web site also advises potential applicants that they can send a hard copy resume to the HR Manager with a cover letter identifying the position for which they would like to be considered. Because Contractor A considers both Internet and traditional expressions of interest for the Mechanical Engineer position, both the individuals who completed a personal profile and those who sent a paper resume and cover letter to Contractor A meet this part of the definition of Internet Applicant for this position.

(ii) Example B: Contractor B posts on its web site an opening for the Accountant II position and encourages potential applicants to complete an on-line profile if they are interested in being considered for that position. Contractor B also receives a large number of unsolicited paper resumes in the mail each year. Contractor B scans these paper resumes into an internal resume database that also includes all the on-line profiles that individuals completed for various jobs (including possibly for the Accountant II position) throughout the year. To find potential applicants for the Accountant II position, Contractor B searches the internal resume database for individuals who have the basic qualifications for the Accountant II position. Because Contractor B considers both Internet and traditional expressions of interest for the Accountant II position, both the individuals who completed a personal profile and those who sent a paper resume and cover letter to the employer meet this part of the definition of Internet Applicant for this position.

(iii) Example C: Contractor C advertises for Mechanics in a local newspaper and instructs interested candidates to mail their resumes to the employer's address. Walk-in applications also are permitted. Contractor C considers only paper resumes and application forms for the Mechanic position, therefore no individual meets this part of the definition of an Internet Applicant for this position.

(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(ii) of this definition, “considers the individual for employment in a particular position,” means that the contractor assesses the substantive information provided in the expression of interest with respect to any qualifications involved with a particular position. A contractor may establish a protocol under which it refrains from considering expressions of interest that are not submitted in accordance with standard procedures the contractor establishes. Likewise, a contractor may establish a protocol under which it refrains from considering expressions of interest, such as unsolicited resumes, that are not submitted with respect to a particular position. If there are a large number of expressions of interest, the contractor does not “consider the individual for employment in a particular position” by using data management techniques that do not depend on assessment of qualifications, such as random sampling or absolute numerical limits, to reduce the number of expressions of interest to be considered, provided that the sample is appropriate in terms of the pool of those submitting expressions of interest.

(4) For purposes of paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition, “basic qualifications” means qualifications -

(i)(A) That the contractor advertises (e.g., posts on its web site a description of the job and the qualifications involved) to potential applicants that they must possess in order to be considered for the position, or

(B) For which the contractor establishes criteria in advance by making and maintaining a record of such qualifications for the position prior to considering any expression of interest for that particular position if the contractor does not advertise for the position but instead uses an alternative device to find individuals for consideration (e.g., through an external resume database), and

(ii) That meet all of the following three conditions:

(A) The qualifications must be noncomparative features of a job seeker. For example, a qualification of three years' experience in a particular position is a noncomparative qualification; a qualification that an individual have one of the top five number of years' experience among a pool of job seekers is a comparative qualification.

(B) The qualifications must be objective; they do not depend on the contractor's subjective judgment. For example, “a Bachelor's degree in Accounting” is objective, while “a technical degree from a good school” is not. A basic qualification is objective if a third-party, with the contractor's technical knowledge, would be able to evaluate whether the job seeker possesses the qualification without more information about the contractor's judgment.

(C) The qualifications must be relevant to performance of the particular position and enable the contractor to accomplish business-related goals.

(5) For purposes of paragraph (1)(iv) of this definition, a contractor may conclude that an individual has removed himself or herself from further consideration, or has otherwise indicated that he or she is no longer interested in the position for which the contractor has considered the individual, based on the individual's express statement that he or she is no longer interested in the position, or on the individual's passive demonstration of disinterest shown through repeated non-responsiveness to inquiries from the contractor about interest in the position. A contractor also may determine that an individual has removed himself or herself from further consideration or otherwise indicated that he or she is no longer interested in the position for which the contractor has considered the individual based on information the individual provided in the expression of interest, such as salary requirements or preferences as to type of work or location of work, provided that the contractor has a uniformly and consistently applied policy or procedure of not considering similarly situated job seekers. If a large number of individuals meet the basic qualifications for the position, a contractor may also use data management techniques, such as random sampling or absolute numerical limits, to limit the number of individuals who must be contacted to determine their interest in the position, provided that the sample is appropriate in terms of the pool of those meeting the basic qualifications.

*Minority group* as used herein shall include, where appropriate, female employees and prospective female employees.

*Modification* means any alteration in the terms and conditions of a contract, including supplemental agreements, amendments, and extensions.

*Order, Executive order,* or *Executive Order 11246* means parts II, III, and IV of the Executive Order 11246 dated September 24, 1965 (30 FR 12319), any Executive order amending such order, and any other Executive order superseding such order.

*Particular religion* means the religion of a particular individual, corporation, association, educational institution, society, school, college, university, or institution of learning, including acceptance of or adherence to sincere religious tenets as understood by the employer as a condition of employment, whether or not the particular religion of an individual employee or applicant is the same as the particular religion of his or her employer or prospective employer.

*Person* means any natural person, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association, State or local government, and any agency, instrumentality, or subdivision of such a government.

*Prime contractor* means any person holding a contract and, for the purposes of subpart B of this part, any person who has held a contract subject to the order.

*Qualitative evidence* includes but is not limited to testimony, interview statements, and documents about biased statements, remarks, attitudes, or acts based upon membership in a protected class, particularly when made by a decision maker involved in the action under investigation; testimony, interview statements, and documents about individuals denied or given misleading or contradictory information about employment or compensation practices, in circumstances suggesting discriminatory treatment based on a protected characteristic; testimony, interview statements, and documents about the extent of discretion or subjectivity involved in making employment decisions, in conjunction with evidence suggesting the discretion or subjectivity has been used to discriminate based on a protected characteristic; or other anecdotal evidence relevant to determining a contractor's discriminatory or non-discriminatory intent, the business necessity (or lack thereof) of a challenged policy or practice, or whether the contractor has otherwise complied with its non-discrimination obligations. Qualitative evidence may not be based solely on subjective inferences or the mere fact of supervisory discretion in employment decisions. The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) may also consider qualitative evidence in the form of a contractor's efforts to advance equal employment opportunity beyond mere compliance with legal obligations in determining whether intentional discrimination has occurred.

*Quantitative evidence* includes hypothesis testing, controlling for the major, measurable parameters, and variables used by the contractor (including, as appropriate, preferred qualifications, other demographic variables, test scores, geographic variables, performance evaluations, years of experience, quality of experience, years of service, quality and reputation of previous employers, years of education, years of training, quality and reputation of credentialing institutions, *etc.*), related to the probability of outcomes occurring by chance and/or analyses reflecting statements concluding that a disparity in employment selection rates or rates of compensation is statistically significant by reference to any one of these statements:

(1) The disparity is two or more times larger than its standard error (*i.e.,* a standard deviation of two or more);

(2) The Z statistic has a value greater than two; or

(3) The probability value is less than 0.05. It also includes numerical analysis of similarly situated individuals, small groups, or other characteristics, demographics or outcomes where hypothesis-testing techniques are not used.

*Recruiting and training agency* means any person who refers workers to any contractor or subcontractor or who provides for employment by any contractor or subcontractor.

*Religion* includes all aspects of religious observance and practice, as well as belief.

*Religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society.* (1) Religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society means a corporation, association, educational institution, society, school, college, university, or institution of learning that:

(i) Is organized for a religious purpose;

(ii) Holds itself out to the public as carrying out a religious purpose;

(iii) Engages in activity consistent with, and in furtherance of, that religious purpose; and

(iv)(A) Operates on a not-for-profit basis; or

(B) Presents other strong evidence that its purpose is substantially religious.

(2) Whether an organization's engagement in activity is consistent with, and in furtherance of, its religious purpose is determined by reference to the organization's own sincere understanding of its religious tenets.

(3) To qualify as religious a corporation, association, educational institution, society, school, college, university, or institution of learning may, or may not: Have a mosque, church, synagogue, temple, or other house of worship; or be supported by, be affiliated with, identify with, or be composed of individuals sharing, any single religion, sect, denomination, or other religious tradition.

(4) The following examples apply this definition to various scenarios. It is assumed in each example that the employer is a federal contractor subject to Executive Order 11246.

(i)(A) *Example.* A closely held for-profit manufacturer makes and sells metal candlesticks and other decorative items. The manufacturer's mission statement asserts that it is committed to providing high-quality candlesticks and similar items to all of its customers, a majority of which are churches and synagogues. Some of the manufacturer's items are also purchased by federal agencies for use during diplomatic events and presentations. The manufacturer regularly consults with ministers and rabbis regarding new designs to ensure that they conform to any religious specifications. The manufacturer also advertises heavily in predominantly religious publications and donates a portion of each sale to charities run by churches and synagogues.

(B) *Application.* The manufacturer likely does not qualify as a religious organization. Although the manufacturer provides goods predominantly for religious communities, the manufacturer's fundamental purpose is secular and pecuniary, not religious, as evidenced by its mission statement. Because the manufacturer lacks a religious purpose, it cannot carry out activity consistent with that (nonexistent) religious purpose. And while the manufacturer advertises heavily in religious publications and consults with religious functionaries on its designs, the manufacturer does not identify itself, as opposed to its customers, as religious. Finally, given that the manufacturer is a for-profit entity, it would need to make a strong evidentiary showing that it is a religious organization, which it has not.

(ii)(A) *Example.* A nonprofit organization enters government contracts to provide chaplaincy services to military and federal law-enforcement organizations around the country. The contractor is organized as a non-profit, but it charges the military and other clients a fee, similar to fees charged by other staffing organizations, and its manager and employees all collect a market-rate salary. The organization's articles of incorporation state that its purpose is to provide religious services to members of the same faith wherever they may be in the world, and to educate other individuals about the faith. Similar statements of purpose appear on the organization's website and in its bid responses to government requests for proposals. All employees receive weekly emails, and occasionally videos, about ways to promote faith in the workplace. The employee handbook contains several requirements regarding personal and workplace conduct to ensure “a Christian atmosphere where the Spirit of the Lord can guide the organization's work.”

(B) *Application.* Under these facts, the contractor likely qualifies as a religious organization. The contractor's organizing documents expressly state that its mission is primarily religious in nature. Moreover, the contractor exercises religion through its business activities, which is providing chaplaincy services, and through its hiring and training practices. Through its emails and other communications, the contractor holds itself out as a religious organization to its employees, applicants, and clients. Finally, notwithstanding that the contractor collects a placement fee similar to nonreligious staffing companies, it is organized as a non-profit.

(iii)(A) *Example.* A small catering company provides kosher meals primarily to synagogues and for various events in the Jewish community, but other customers, including federal agencies, sometimes hire the caterer to provide meals for conferences and other events. The company's two owners are Hasidic Jews and its six employees, while not exclusively Jewish, receive instruction in kosher food preparation to ensure such preparation comports with Jewish laws and customs. This additional work raises the company's operating costs higher than were it to provide non-kosher meals. The company's mission statement, which has remained substantially the same since the company was organized, describes its purpose as fulfilling a religious mandate to strengthen the Jewish community and ensure Jewish persons can participate fully in public life by providing kosher meals. The company's “about us” page on its website states that above all else, the company seeks to “honor G-d” and maintain the strength of the Jewish religion through its kosher meal services. The company also donates a portion of its proceeds to charitable projects sponsored by local Jewish congregations. In its advertising and on its website, the company prominently includes religious symbols and text.

(B) *Application.* The company likely qualifies as a religious organization. The company's mission statement and other materials show a religious purpose. Its predominant business activity of providing kosher meals directly furthers and is wholly consistent with that self-identified religious purpose, as are its hiring and training practices. Through its advertising and website, the company holds itself out as a religious organization. Finally, although the company operates on a for-profit basis, the other facts here show strong evidence that the company operates as a religious organization.

(iv)(A) *Example.* A for-profit collector business sells a wide variety of artistic, cultural, religious, and archeological items. The government purchases some of these from time to time for research or aesthetic purposes. The business's mission statement provides that its purpose is to curate the world's treasures to perpetuate its historic, cultural, and religious legacy. Most of the business's customers are private individuals or museums interested in the items as display pieces or for their cultural value. The business's marketing materials include examples of religious iconography and artifacts from a variety of world religions, as well as various cultural and artistic items.

(B) *Application.* The business likely does not qualify as a religious organization. Its mission statement references an arguably religious purpose, namely perpetuating the world's religious legacy, but in context that appears to have more to do with religion's historic value rather than evidencing a religious conviction of the business or its owner. Similarly, it is at best unclear whether the business is engaging in activities in furtherance of this purpose when most of its sales serve no religious purpose. Finally, while the business displays some religious items, these appear to be a minor part of the business's overall presentation and do not convey that the business has a religious identity. The factors to qualify as a religious organization do not appear to be met, especially given that the business as a for-profit entity would need to make a strong evidentiary showing that it is a religious organization.

*Rules, regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor* used in paragraph (4) of the equal opportunity clause means rules, regulations, and relevant orders of the Secretary of Labor or his designee issued pursuant to the order.

*Secretary* means the Secretary of Labor, U.S. Department of Labor, or his or her designee.

*Sincere* means sincere under the law applied by the courts of the United States when ascertaining the sincerity of a party's religious exercise or belief.

*Site of construction* means the general physical location of any building, highway, or other change or improvement to real property which is undergoing construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, demolition, or repair and any temporary location or facility at which a contractor, subcontractor, or other participating party meets a demand or performs a function relating to the contract or subcontract.

*Subcontract.* (1) Subcontract means any agreement or arrangement between a contractor and any person (in which the parties do not stand in the relationship of an employer and an employee):

(i) For the purchase, sale or use of personal property or nonpersonal services which, in whole or in part, is necessary to the performance of any one or more contracts; or

(ii) Under which any portion of the contractor's obligation under any one or more contracts is performed, undertaken, or assumed; and

(2) Does not include an agreement between a health care provider and a health organization under which the health care provider agrees to provide health care services or supplies to natural persons who are beneficiaries under TRICARE.

(i) An agreement means a relationship between a health care provider and a health organization under which the health care provider agrees to provide health care services or supplies to natural persons who are beneficiaries under TRICARE.

(ii) A health care provider is a physician, hospital, or other individual or entity that furnishes health care services or supplies.

(iii) A health organization is a voluntary association, corporation, partnership, managed care support contractor, or other nongovernmental organization that is lawfully engaged in providing, paying for, insuring, or reimbursing the cost of health care services or supplies under group insurance policies or contracts, medical or hospital service agreements, membership or subscription contracts, network agreements, health benefits plans duly sponsored or underwritten by an employee organization or association of organizations and health maintenance organizations, or other similar arrangements, in consideration of premiums or other periodic charges or payments payable to the health organization.

*Subcontractor* means any person holding a subcontract and, for the purposes of subpart B of this part, any person who has held a subcontract subject to the order. The term “first-tier subcontractor” refers to a subcontractor holding a subcontract with a prime contractor.

*United States* as used herein shall include the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Panama Canal Zone, and the possessions of the United States.

*United States,* as used herein, shall include the several States, the District of Columbia, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Wake Island.

(a) *Severability.* Should a court of competent jurisdiction hold any provision(s) of this section to be invalid, such action will not affect any other provision of this section.
