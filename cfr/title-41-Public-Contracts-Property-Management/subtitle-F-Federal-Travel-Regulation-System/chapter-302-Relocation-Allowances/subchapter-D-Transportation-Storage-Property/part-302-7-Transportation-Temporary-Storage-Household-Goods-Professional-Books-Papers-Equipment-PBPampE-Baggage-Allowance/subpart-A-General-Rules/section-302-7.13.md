##### ยง 302-7.13 What are the various methods of shipping HHG and how is the weight determined for each type of shipment? #####

HHG should be shipped by the most economical method available. The various methods of shipment and weight calculations include the following:

|                                   (a) Uncrated (shipped in HHG movers van or similar conveyance)                                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        An allowance of up to 2,000 pounds, exclusive of the 18,000 pounds net weight of HHG shipment, is used for the packing weight covering barrels, boxes, cartons, and similar material but does not include pads, chains, dollies and other equipment to load and secure the shipment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|                                                        (b) Crated shipments                                                        |                                                                                                                                                                           When crated the net weight will not include the weight of the crating material. The net weight will be computed as being 60 percent of the gross weight. However, if the net weight computed in this manner exceeds the applicable weight limitation and if it is determined that, for reasons beyond the employee's control, unusually heavy crating and packing materials were necessarily used, the net weight may be computed at less than 60 percent of the gross weight.                                                                                                                                                                            |
|(c) Containerized shipments (Special containers designed, e.g., lift vans, CONEX transporters, HHG shipping boxes, for repeated use)|                                                                                                                                                                                                  When the known tare weight does not include the weight of interior bracing and padding materials but only the weight of the container, the net weight will be 85 percent of the gross weight less the weight of the container. If the known tare weight includes such material, so that the net weight is the same as it would be for uncrated shipments in interstate commerce, the net weight will not be subject to reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|                                                      (d) Constructive weight                                                       |If adequate scales are not available at origin, en route or at destination, a constructive weight based on 7 pounds per cubic foot of properly loaded van space may be used. Such weight may be used for a part-load when its weight could not be obtained, without first unloading it or other part-loads being carried in the same vehicle or when the HHG are not weighed because the carrier's charges for local or metropolitan area moves are properly computed on the basis other than weight or volume of the shipment (as when payment is based on an hourly rate and distance involved). In such instances a statement from the carrier showing the properly loaded van space required for the shipment should be obtained with respect to proof of entitlement to a commuted rate payment when net weight cannot be shown.|
