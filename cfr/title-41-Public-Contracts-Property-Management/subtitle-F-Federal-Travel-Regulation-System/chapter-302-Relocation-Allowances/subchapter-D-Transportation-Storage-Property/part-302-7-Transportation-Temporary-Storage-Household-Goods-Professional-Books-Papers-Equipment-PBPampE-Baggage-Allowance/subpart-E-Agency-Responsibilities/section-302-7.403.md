##### ยง 302-7.403 What guidelines must we follow when authorizing transportation of PBP&E as an administrative expense? #####

You have the sole discretion to authorize transportation of PBP&E as an administrative expense and may do so provided that:

(a) The authorizing official has certified that the PBP&E is necessary for performance of the employee's duties at the new duty station;

(b) The authorizing official has certified that, if these items were not transported, the same or similar items would have to be obtained at Government expense for the employee's use at the new official station;

(c) You have acquired evidence that transporting the PBP&E would cause the employees' HHG to exceed the 18,000 pounds net weight allowance; and

(d) If you have requested it, the employee has provided reasonable documentation of the items requesting to be shipped as PBP&E and the weight of the PBP&E for review by the authorizing official (who is usually an official at the employee's new official station).

Note to ยง 302-7.403:

PBP&E transported as an agency administrative expense to an OCONUS location may be returned to CONUS as an agency administrative expense for an employee separating from Government service or returning to the actual place of residence and continuing in Government service.
