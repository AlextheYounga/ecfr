Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 64783, Nov. 25, 2019.

(a) Year 1 is the calendar year in which the agency reimburses you for a specific expense, provides an allowance, or pays a vendor directly. If your reimbursements, allowances, and/or direct payments to vendors occur in more than one calendar year, you will have more than one Year 1.

(b) Year 2 is the calendar year in which you submit your RITA claim and your agency pays your RITA to you.

(c) In most cases:

(1) For every Year 1 you will have a corresponding Year 2;

(2) Every Year 2 immediately follows a Year 1; and

(3) Year 2 is the year in which you file a tax return reflecting your remaining tax liability for taxable reimbursement(s), allowance(s), and/or direct payments to vendors in each Year 1.

(d) The table below offers a graphic explanation of Year 1 and Year 2, assuming that you begin your relocation in 2012 and incurred additional approved expenses in 2013.
