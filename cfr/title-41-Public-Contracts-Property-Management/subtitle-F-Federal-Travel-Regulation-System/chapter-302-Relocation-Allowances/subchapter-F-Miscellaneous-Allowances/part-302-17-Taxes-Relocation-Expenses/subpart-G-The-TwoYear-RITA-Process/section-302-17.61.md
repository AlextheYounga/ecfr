Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 64783, Nov. 25, 2019.

(a) Yes. If your agency makes the WTA optional to you, you may choose to not receive the WTA.

(b) WTA is paid at a rate of 25 percent. When deciding whether or not to receive the WTA, you should consider the following:

(1) If you expect that your marginal Federal tax rate will be 25 percent or higher for the calendar year for which you received the majority of your relocation reimbursements, you may want to elect to receive the WTA, because your initial reimbursements will be higher, as shown in the following Example 3 to part 302-17).

Example 3 to part 302-17:Claims Paid with and without WTA.

|Allowance computed without WTA:|         |                                            |
|:------------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
|                               |$1,300.00|     Miscellaneous Expenses Allowance.      |
|             Minus             | 325.00  |       Federal Withholding Tax (25%).       |
|             Minus             |  18.85  |     Medicare Withholding Tax (1.45%).      |
|             Minus             |  80.60  |    FICA (Social Security) Tax (6.20%).     |
|            Equals             | 875.55  |       Amount due to the transferee.        |
| Allowance computed with WTA:  |         |                                            |
|                               |1,300.00 |     Miscellaneous Expenses Allowance.      |
|             Plus              | 433.33  |Withholding Tax Allowance (25% of $1733.33).|
|            Equals             |1,733.33 |          Net allowance with WTA.           |
|             Minus             | 433.33  |       Federal Withholding Tax (25%).       |

|             Minus             | 107.47  |    FICA (Social Security) Tax (6.20%).     |
|            Equals             |1,167.40 |       Amount due to the transferee.        |

(2) If you expect that your marginal Federal tax rate will be less than 25 percent, you may want to decline the WTA to avoid or limit possible overpayment of the WTA, the so-called “negative RITA” situation. In a “negative RITA” situation, you must repay some of the WTA in Year 2. However, even if your marginal Federal tax rate will be less than 25 percent, you may want to accept the WTA so that your initial reimbursement is larger. Example 3 shows the relative reimbursements you would receive by accepting and declining the WTA, in the case of a hypothetical $1,300 Miscellaneous Expense Allowance.
