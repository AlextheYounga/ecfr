##### § 302-17.5 Who is eligible for the WTA and the RITA? #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 64782, Nov. 25, 2019.

The withholding tax allowance (WTA) and the relocation income tax allowance (RITA) are the two allowances through which the Government reimburses you for substantially all of the income taxes that you incur as a result of your relocation. You are eligible for the WTA and the RITA if your agency is transferring you from one permanent duty station to another, in the interest of the Government, and your agency's reimbursements to you for relocation expenses result in you being liable for additional taxes.

Note to § 302-17.5:

If your agency offers you the choice, the WTA is optional to you. See 302-17.61 through 302-17.69.
