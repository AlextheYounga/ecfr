##### § 302-17.13 How are taxes on extended TDY benefits and taxes on relocation allowances related? #####

(a) Taxes on extended TDY benefits are computed using exactly the same processes described in this Part for the WTA and RITA except that:

(1) The tax process for extended TDY benefits uses the term “withholding tax allowance” (WTA) in exactly the same fashion as the process for taxes on relocation allowances; however, in place of the term “relocation income tax allowance,” the tax process for extended TDY benefits uses the term “extended TDY tax reimbursement allowance” (ETTRA); and

(2) All benefits are taxable under extended TDY, so the sections of this Part that discuss which benefits are taxable and which are not have no relevance to ETTRA.

(b) See Part 301-11, Subpart F of this Title for additional information about taxes on extended TDY benefits.
