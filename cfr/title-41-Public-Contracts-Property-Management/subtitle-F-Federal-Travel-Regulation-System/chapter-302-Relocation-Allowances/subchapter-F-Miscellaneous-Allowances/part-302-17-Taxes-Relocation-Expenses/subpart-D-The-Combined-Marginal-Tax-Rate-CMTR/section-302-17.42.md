##### ยง 302-17.42 Which state marginal tax rate(s) does my agency use to calculate the CMTR if I incur tax liability in more than one state, and how does this affect my RITA and my state tax return(s)? #####

If two or more states that are involved in your relocation impose an income tax on relocation benefits, then your relocation benefits may be taxed by both states. Most commonly, your old and new duty stations are in the two states involved. The following table lays out the possibilities:

|Each involved state taxes a different set of your relocation benefits, with no overlap|                                                                                                               |        The average of the marginal tax rates for each state involved         |          Taxes you incur in all involved states          |                                            You file tax returns in each involved state and pay the applicable taxes.                                             |
