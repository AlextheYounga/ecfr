##### ยง 302-1.102 Are agencies required to report their employee relocation activities to GSA? #####

Yes, every agency that spends more than $5 million a year on travel and transportation payments, including relocation, during the fiscal year immediately preceding the survey year, must annually report their employee relocation activities to GSA. GSA works with the agencies to develop and refine the data elements, report format, and due dates for these reports. GSA publishes these specific requirements in a series of FTR Bulletins.
