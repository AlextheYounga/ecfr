##### ยง 302-4.300 What is the POV mileage rate for PCS travel? #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 64781, Nov. 25, 2019.

For approved/authorized PCS travel by POV, the mileage reimbursement rate is the same as the moving expense mileage rate established by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for moving expense deductions. See IRS guidance available on the Internet at *www.irs.gov.* GSA publishes the rate for mileage reimbursement in an FTR Bulletin on an intermittent basis. You may find the FTR Bulletins at *www.gsa.gov/relo.*
