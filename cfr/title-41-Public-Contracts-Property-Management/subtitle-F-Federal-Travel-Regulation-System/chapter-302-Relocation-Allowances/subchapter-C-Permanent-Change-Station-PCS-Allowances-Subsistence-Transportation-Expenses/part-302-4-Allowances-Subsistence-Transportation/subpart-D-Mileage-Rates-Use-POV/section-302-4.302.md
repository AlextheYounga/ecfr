Yes, your agency may authorize a higher mileage rate at a rate not to exceed the maximum rate prescribed in ยง 301-10.303 of this title when:

(a) You are expected to use the POV on official business at the new official station;

(b) The common carrier rates for the facilities provided between the old and new official stations, the related constructive taxicab fares to and from terminals, and the per diem allowances prescribed under this part justify a higher mileage rate as advantageous to the Government as determined by your agency; or

(c) The costs of driving the POV to, from, or between official stations located outside CONUS justify a higher mileage rate as advantageous to the Government.
