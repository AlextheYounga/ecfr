##### ยง 302-6.17 Am I eligible for a TQSE allowance if I transfer to a foreign area? #####

No, you may not receive a TQSE allowance under this part when you transfer to an area outside the United States. However, you may qualify for a comparable allowance under the Standardized Regulations (Government Civilians, Foreign Areas) prescribed by the Department of State.
