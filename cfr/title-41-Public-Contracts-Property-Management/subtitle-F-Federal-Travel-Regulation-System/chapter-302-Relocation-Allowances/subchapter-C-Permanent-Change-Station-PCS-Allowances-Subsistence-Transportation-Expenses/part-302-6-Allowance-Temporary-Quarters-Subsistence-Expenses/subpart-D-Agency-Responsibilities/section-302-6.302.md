##### ยง 302-6.302 Under what circumstances may we authorize the TQSE allowance? #####

You may authorize a TQSE allowance on an individual-case basis when use of temporary quarters is justified in connection with an employee's transfer to a new official station. You may not authorize a TQSE allowance for vacation purposes or other reasons unrelated to the transfer.
