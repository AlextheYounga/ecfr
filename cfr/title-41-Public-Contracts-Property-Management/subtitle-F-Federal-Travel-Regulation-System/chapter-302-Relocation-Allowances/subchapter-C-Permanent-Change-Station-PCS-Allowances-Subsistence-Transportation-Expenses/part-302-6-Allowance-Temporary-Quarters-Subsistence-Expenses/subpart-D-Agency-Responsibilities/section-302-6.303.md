##### § 302-6.303 What factors should we consider in determining whether the TQSE allowance is actually necessary? #####

The factors you should consider include:

(a) *The length of time the employee should reasonably be expected to occupy his/her residence at the old official station prior to reporting for duty at the new official station.* An employee and his/her immediate family should continue to occupy the residence at the old official station for as long as practicable to avoid the necessity for temporary quarters.

(b) *The existence of less expensive alternatives.* If a less expensive alternative to the TQSE allowance exists that will enable the employee to find permanent quarters at the new official station, you should consider such an alternative. For example, authorize a househunting trip instead of temporary quarters if it would cost less overall.

(c) *The existence of other opportunities to arrange for permanent quarters.* Consider whether the employee had other adequate opportunity to arrange for permanent quarters. For example, you should not authorize temporary quarters if the employee had adequate opportunity during an extended temporary duty assignment to arrange for permanent quarters.
