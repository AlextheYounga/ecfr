##### ยง 302-6.300 How should we administer the TQSE allowance? #####

Temporary quarters should be used only if, and only for as long as, necessary until the employee and/or the employee's immediate family can move into permanent residence quarters. You must administer the TQSE allowance to minimize or avoid other relocation expenses.
