##### § 302-6.100 What am I paid under the actual TQSE reimbursement method? #####

Your agency will pay your actual TQSE incurred, provided the expenses are reasonable and do not exceed the maximum allowable amount. The “maximum allowable amount” is the “maximum daily amount” multiplied by the number of days you actually incur TQSE not to exceed the number of days authorized, taking into account that the rates change after 30 days in temporary quarters. The “maximum daily amount” is determined by adding the rates in the following table for you and each member of your immediate family authorized to occupy temporary quarters:

|                                                                                   |                      The “maximum daily amount” of TQSE under the actual expense method that                       |                                                                    |                                      |
