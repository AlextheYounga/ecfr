Yes, you and your family may travel to another U.S. location (other than from your actual place of residence) under your tour renewal agreement. However, your agency will only reimburse you for the amount of authorized expenses from your post of duty to your actual place of residence and return (as appropriate) on a usually traveled route.

Note to ยง 302-3.220:

If your actual place of residence is located in the U.S., you and your family must spend a substantial amount of time in the U.S. in order to receive reimbursement.
