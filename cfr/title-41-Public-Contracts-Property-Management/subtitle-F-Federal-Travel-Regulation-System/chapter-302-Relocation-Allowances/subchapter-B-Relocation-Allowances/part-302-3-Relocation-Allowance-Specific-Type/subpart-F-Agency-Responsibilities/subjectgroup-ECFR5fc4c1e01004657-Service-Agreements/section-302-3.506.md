##### ยง 302-3.506 May we pay relocation expenses if the employee violates their service agreement? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 89504, Nov. 13, 2024.

If an employee does not fulfill the terms of the service agreement, the employee is indebted to the Government for all relocation expenses that have been reimbursed to the employee or that have been paid directly by the Government. However, if the reasons for not fulfilling the terms of the service agreement are beyond the employee's control and acceptable to the agency, you may release the employee from the service agreement and waive any indebtedness.
