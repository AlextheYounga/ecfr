##### § 301-73.101 How must we prepare to implement ETS? #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 77028, Sept. 20, 2024.

You must prepare to implement ETS as expeditiously as possible by—

(a) Developing a migration plan and schedule to deploy ETS across your agency as early as possible with full deployment required no later than September 30, 2006;

(b) Requiring employees to use your ETS unless you approve an exception under § 301-50.6, § 301-73.102 or § 301-73.104;

(c) Establishing goals, plans and procedures to maximize agency-wide traveler use of your online self-service booking tool once you have fully deployed ETS within your agency. These goals, plans, and procedures should be available for submission to the ETS PMO upon its request.

Note 1 to § 301-73.101:

Your agency should work with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to allocate budget and personnel resources to support ETS migration and data exchange. Your agency is responsible for providing the funds required to establish interfaces between the ETS standard data output and applicable business systems (e.g., financial, human resources, etc.).

Note 2 to § 301-73.101:

Best practices show that organizations are able to realize significant benefits once they achieve a 70 percent or greater self-booking rate.
