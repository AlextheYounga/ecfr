You must establish policies and procedures governing:

(a) Who will determine what method of transportation is more advantageous to the Government;

(b) Who will approve any of the following:

(1) Use of other than coach-class transportation accommodations for air and rail under §§ 301-10.123 and 301-10.162, and lowest first-class accommodations for ship under § 301-10.183 of this chapter.

(2) Use of a special-reduced fare or reduced group or charter fare;

(c) When you will:

(1) Require the use of a Government vehicle;

(2) Allow the use of a Government vehicle; and

(3) Prohibit the use of a Government vehicle;

(d) When you will consider use of a POV advantageous to the Government, such as travel to and from common carrier terminals or to the TDY location. When determining whether the use of a POV to a TDY location is the most advantageous method of transportation, agencies must consider the total cost of using a POV as compared to the total cost of using a rental vehicle, including rental costs, fuel, taxes, parking (at a common carrier terminal, etc.), and any other associated costs;

(g) What procedures an employee must follow when he/she travels by an indirect route or interrupts travel by a direct route;

(h) Whether to reimburse the full amount of transportation costs and in conjunction with TDY or only the amount by which transportation costs exceed the employee's normal costs for transportation between:

(1) Office or duty point and another place of business;

(2) Places of business; or

(3) Residence and place of business other than office or duty point;

(i) Develop and issue internal guidance on what specific mission criteria justify approval of the use of other than coach-class transportation under §§ 301-10.123(a)(4), 301-10.123(b)(9), and 301-10.162(e), as well as on the use of other than lowest first-class under § 301-10.183(d) and the use of other than a compact rental car under § 301-10.450(c). The justification criteria shall be entered in the remarks section of the traveler's authorization.
