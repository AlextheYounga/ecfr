Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 2845, Jan. 18, 2023.

No, but if the employee elects to use a POV instead of an alternative form of transportation you authorize, you must:

(a) Limit reimbursement to the constructive cost of the authorized method of transportation, which is the sum of per diem and transportation expenses the employee would reasonably have incurred when traveling by the authorized method of transportation; and

(b) Charge leave for any duty hours that are missed as a result of travel by POV.
