Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 39848, July 2, 2020.

If you travel to a location where the per diem rate is insufficient to meet necessary expenses, you may submit a request, containing pertinent lodging & meal cost data, through your agency's Travel Manager asking that the location be reviewed. Depending on the location in question your agency's Travel Manager may submit the review request to:

|                                                       For CONUS locations                                                       |                                          For non-foreign area locations                                          |                                     For foreign area locations                                      |
