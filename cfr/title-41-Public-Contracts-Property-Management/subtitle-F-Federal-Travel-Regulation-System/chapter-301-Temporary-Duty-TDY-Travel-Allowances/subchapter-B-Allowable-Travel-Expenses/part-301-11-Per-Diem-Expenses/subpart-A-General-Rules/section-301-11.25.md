Yes. You must provide a lodging receipt and a receipt for every authorized expense over $75, or provide a reason acceptable to your agency explaining why you are unable to furnish the necessary receipt(s) (see ยง 301-52.4 of this chapter).

Note to ยง 301-11.25:

Hard copy receipts should be electronically scanned and submitted with your electronic travel claim when your agency has fully deployed ETS and notifies you that electronic scanning is available within your agency (see ยง 301-50.3 of this chapter). You may submit a hard copy receipt, in accordance with your agency's policies, to support a claimed travel expense only when electronic imaging is not available within your agency.
