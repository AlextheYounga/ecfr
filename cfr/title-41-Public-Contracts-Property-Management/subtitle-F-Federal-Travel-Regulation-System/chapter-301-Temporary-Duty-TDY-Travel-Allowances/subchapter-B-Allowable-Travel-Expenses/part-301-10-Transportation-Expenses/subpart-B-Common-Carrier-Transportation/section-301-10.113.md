##### ยง 301-10.113 What must I do if I change or do not use a common carrier reservation? #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 55704, Sept. 12, 2022.

If you know you will change or not use your reservation, you must take action to change or cancel it as prescribed by your agency. Also, you must report all changes of your reservation according to your agency's procedures in an effort to prevent losses to the Government. Failure to do so may subject you to liability for any resulting losses.
