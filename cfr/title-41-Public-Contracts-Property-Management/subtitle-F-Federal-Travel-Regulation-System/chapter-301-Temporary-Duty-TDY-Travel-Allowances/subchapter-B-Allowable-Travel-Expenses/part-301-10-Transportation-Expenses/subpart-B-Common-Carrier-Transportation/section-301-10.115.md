No. You are not authorized to receive a refund, credit, or any other negotiable document from a carrier for unfurnished services (except as provided in ยง 301-10.117) or any portion of an unused ticket issued in exchange for a GTR or billed to an agency's centrally billed account. However, any charges billed directly to your individually billed Government charge card should be credited to your account.
