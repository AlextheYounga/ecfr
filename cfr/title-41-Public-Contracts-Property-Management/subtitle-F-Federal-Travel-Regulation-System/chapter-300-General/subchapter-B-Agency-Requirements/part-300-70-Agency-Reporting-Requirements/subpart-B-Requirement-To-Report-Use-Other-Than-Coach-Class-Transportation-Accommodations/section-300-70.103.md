##### § 300-70.103 Are there any exceptions to the reporting requirement? #####

Yes. You are not required to report data that is protected from public disclosure by statute or Executive Order. However, you are required to submit, in a cover letter to GSA, the following aggregate information.

(a) Aggregate number of authorized other than coach-class trips that are protected from disclosure;

(b) Total cost of actual other than coach-class fares paid that exceeded the coach-class fare; and

(c) Total cost of coach class fares that would have been paid for the same travel.

Note to § 300-70.103:

If the aggregate information is also protected from public disclosure then a negative report must be submitted to GSA.
