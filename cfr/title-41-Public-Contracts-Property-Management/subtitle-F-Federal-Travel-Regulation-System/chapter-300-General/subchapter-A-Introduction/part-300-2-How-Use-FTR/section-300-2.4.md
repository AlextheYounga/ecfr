##### ยง 300-2.4 How is the user addressed in the FTR? #####

The FTR asks questions in the first person, as the user would. It then answers the questions in the second and third person. In the employee sections, the employee is addressed in the singular, and in the agency sections, the agency is addressed in the plural. The following describes how employee and agency are addressed in both sections:
