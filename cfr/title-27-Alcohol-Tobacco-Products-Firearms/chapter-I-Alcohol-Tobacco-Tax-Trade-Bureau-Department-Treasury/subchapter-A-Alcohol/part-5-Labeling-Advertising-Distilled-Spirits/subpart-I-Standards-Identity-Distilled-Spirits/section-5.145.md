Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 2228, Jan. 13, 2023.

(a) *The class brandy.* “Brandy” is spirits that are distilled from the fermented juice, mash, or wine of fruit, or from the residue thereof, distilled at less than 95 percent alcohol by volume (190° proof) having the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to the product, and bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80° proof).

(b) *Label designations.* Brandy conforming to one of the type designations must be designated with the type name or specific designation specified in the requirements for that type. The term “brandy” without further qualification (such as “peach” or “marc”) may only be used as a designation on labels of grape brandy as defined in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Brandy conforming to one of the type designations defined in paragraphs (c)(1) through (12) of this section must be designated on the label with the type name unless a specific designation is included in the requirements for that type. Brandy, or mixtures thereof, not conforming to any of the types defined in this section must be designated on the label as “brandy” followed immediately by a truthful and adequate statement of composition.

(c) *Types.* Paragraphs (c)(1) through (12) of this section set out the types of brandy and the standards for each type.

|          (1) Fruit brandy           |Brandy distilled solely from the fermented juice or mash of whole, sound, ripe fruit, or from standard grape or other fruit wine, with or without the addition of not more than 20 percent by weight of the pomace of such juice or wine, or 30 percent by volume of the lees of such wine, or both (calculated prior to the addition of water to facilitate fermentation or distillation). Fruit brandy includes mixtures of such brandy with not more than 30 percent (calculated on a proof gallon basis) of lees brandy. Fruit brandy derived solely from grapes and stored for at least 2 years in oak containers must be designated “grape brandy” or “brandy.” Grape brandy that has been stored in oak barrels for fewer than 2 years must be designated “immature grape brandy” or “immature brandy.” Fruit brandy, other than grape brandy, derived from one variety of fruit, must be designated by the word “brandy” qualified by the name of such fruit (for example, “peach brandy”), except that “apple brandy” may be designated “applejack,” “plum brandy” may be designated “Slivovitz,” and “cherry brandy” may be designated “Kirschwasser.” Fruit brandy derived from more than one variety of fruit must be designated as “fruit brandy” qualified by a truthful and adequate statement of composition, for example “Fruit brandy distilled from strawberries and blueberries.”|
