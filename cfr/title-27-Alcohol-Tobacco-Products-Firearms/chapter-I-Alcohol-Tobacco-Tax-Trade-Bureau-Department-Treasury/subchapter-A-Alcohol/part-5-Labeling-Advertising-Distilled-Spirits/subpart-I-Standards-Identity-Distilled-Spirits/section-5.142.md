##### § 5.142 Neutral spirits or alcohol. #####

(a) *The class neutral spirits.* “Neutral spirits” or “alcohol” are distilled spirits distilled from any suitable material at or above 95 percent alcohol by volume (190° proof), and, if bottled, bottled at not less than 40 percent alcohol by volume (80° proof).

Neutral spirits (other than the type “grain spirits”) may not be aged in wood barrels at any time.
