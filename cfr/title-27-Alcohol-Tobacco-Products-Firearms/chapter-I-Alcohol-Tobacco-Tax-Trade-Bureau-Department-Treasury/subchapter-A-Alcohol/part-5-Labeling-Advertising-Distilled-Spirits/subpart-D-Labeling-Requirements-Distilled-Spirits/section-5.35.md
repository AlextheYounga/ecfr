Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 18723, Apr. 2, 2020.

(a) *Designation of product.* The class and type of distilled spirits shall be stated in conformity with § 5.22 if defined therein. In all other instances the product shall be designated in accordance with trade and consumer understanding thereof, or, if no such understanding exists, by a distinctive or fanciful name, and in either case (except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section) followed by a truthful and adequate statement of composition. The word “cordial” or “liqueur” need not be stated in the case of cordials and liqueurs unless the appropriate TTB officer finds such word is necessary to clearly indicate that the product is a cordial or liqueur.

(b) *Products designed in accordance with trade and consumer understanding.* In the case of products designated in accordance with trade and consumer understanding:

(1) A statement of the classes and types of distilled spirits used in the manufacture thereof shall be deemed a sufficient statement of composition in the case of highballs, cocktails, and similar prepared specialties when the designation adequately indicates to the consumer the general character of the product.

(2) No statement of composition is required if the designation through general and established usage adequately indicates to the consumer the composition of the product.

A product shall not bear a designation which indicates it contains a class or type of distilled spirits unless the distilled spirits therein conform to such class and type.

(c) *Origin of whiskies in mixtures.* In the case of any of the types of whisky defined in § 5.22(b), Class 2, which contains any whisky or whiskies produced in a country other than that indicated by the type designation, there shall be stated on the brand label the percentage of such whisky and the country or origin thereof. In the case of mixtures of whisky, not conforming to any type designation in § 5.22(b), Class 2, the components of which were distilled in more than one country, there shall be stated in direct conjunction with the class designation “whisky” a truthful and adequate statement of the composition of the product.

(d) *Whisky manufactured in Scotland, Ireland, or Canada.* All whisky manufactured in Scotland, Ireland, or Canada, shall be deemed to be Scotch, Irish, or Canadian whisky, and shall be so designated, in conformity with § 5.22(b) (7), (8), and (9), unless the application of such designation to the particular product will result in consumer deception, or unless such a product is not entitled to such designation under the laws of the country in which manufactured.

(e) *Cordials and liqueurs.* The alcoholic components of cordails and liqueurs may, but need not, be stated on labels.
