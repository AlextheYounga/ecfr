(3) Specifically describe the alternate method or procedure and set forth the reasons therefor.

No alternate method or procedure relating to the assessment, payment, or collection of tax shall be authorized under this paragraph.

(b) *Approval.* When an application for use of an alternate method or procedure is received, the appropriate TTB officer must determine whether approval thereof would unduly hinder the effective administration of this part or would result in jeopardy to the revenue. The appropriate TTB officer may approve the alternate method or procedure if such officer finds that:

(1) Good cause has been shown for the use of the alternate method or procedure;

(2) The alternate method or procedure is within the purpose of, and consistent with the effect intended by, the specifically prescribed method or procedure, and affords equivalent security to the revenue; and

(3) The alternate method or procedure will not be contrary to any provision of law, and will not result in an increase in cost to the Government or hinder the effective administration of this part.

No alternate method or procedure shall be used until approval has been received from the appropriate TTB officer. Authorization for the alternate method or procedure may be withdrawn whenever in the judgment of the appropriate TTB officer, the revenue is jeopardized or the effective administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of such authorization.(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 1513-0064)[T.D.
