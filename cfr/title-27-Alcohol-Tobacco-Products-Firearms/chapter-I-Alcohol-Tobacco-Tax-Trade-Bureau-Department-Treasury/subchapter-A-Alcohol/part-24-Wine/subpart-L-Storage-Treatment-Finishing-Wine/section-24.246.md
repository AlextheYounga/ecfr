##### § 24.246 Materials authorized for the treatment of wine and juice. #####

(a) *Wine.* Materials used in the process of filtering, clarifying, or purifying wine may remove cloudiness, precipitation, and undesirable odors and flavors, but the addition of any substance foreign to wine which changes the character of the wine, or the abstraction of ingredients which will change its character, to the extent inconsistent with good commercial practice, is not permitted on bonded wine premises. The materials listed in this section are approved, as being consistent with good commercial practice in the production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine, and where applicable in the treatment of juice, within the general limitations of this section: *Provided,* That:

(1) When the specified use or limitation of any material on this list is determined to be unacceptable by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the appropriate TTB officer may cancel or amend the approval for use of the material in the production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine; and

(2) Where water is added to facilitate the solution or dispersal of a material, the volume of water added, whether the material is used singly or in combination with other water based treating materials, may not total more than one percent of the volume of the treated wine, juice, or both wine and juice, from which such wine is produced.

(b) *Formula wine.* In addition to the material listed in this section, other material may be used in formula wine if approved for such use.
