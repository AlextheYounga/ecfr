##### § 24.248 Processes authorized for the treatment of wine, juice, and distilling material. #####

Any process which changes the character of the wine to the extent inconsistent with good commercial practice is not permitted on bonded wine premises. The processes listed in this section are approved as being consistent with good commercial practice for use by proprietors in the production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine, juice, and distilling material, within the general limitations of this section: *Provided,* That when the specified use or limitation of any process on this list is determined to be unacceptable for use in foods and beverages by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the appropriate TTB officer may cancel or amend the approval for use of the process in the production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine, juice, and distilling material.
