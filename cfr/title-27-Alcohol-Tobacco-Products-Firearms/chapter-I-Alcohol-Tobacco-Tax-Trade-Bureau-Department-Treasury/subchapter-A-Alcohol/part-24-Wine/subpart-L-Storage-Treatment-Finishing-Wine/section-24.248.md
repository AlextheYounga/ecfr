##### § 24.248 Processes authorized for the treatment of wine, juice, and distilling material. #####

The processes listed in this section are approved as being consistent with good commercial practice for use by proprietors in the production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine, juice, and distilling material, within the general limitations of this section. If, however, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) informs TTB that a specified use or limitation of any material listed in this section is inconsistent with the food additive requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the appropriate TTB officer may cancel or amend the approval for use of the process in the production, cellar treatment, or finishing of wine, juice, and distilling material.
