##### ยง 24.256 Bottle aging wine. #####

Wine bottled or packed and stored for the purpose of aging need not have labels affixed until the wine is removed for consumption or sale. However, the bins, pallets, stacks, cases or containers of unlabeled wine will be marked in some manner to show the kind (class and type) and alcohol content of the wine. If the unlabeled wine is stored at a location other than the bottling or packing winery, the registry number of the bottling or packing winery will also be shown.
