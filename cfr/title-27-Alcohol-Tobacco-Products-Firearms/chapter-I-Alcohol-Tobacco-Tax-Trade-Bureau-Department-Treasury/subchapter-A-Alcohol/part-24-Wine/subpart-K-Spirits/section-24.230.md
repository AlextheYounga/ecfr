Upon arrival of a tank car or tank truck at the bonded wine premises, the proprietor shall carefully examine the car or truck to see whether the seals are intact and whether there is any evidence of tampering or loss by leaking or otherwise. Any evidence of loss will be reported to the appropriate TTB officer. The contents of the tank car or tank truck will be gauged by weight or volume at the time of receipt by the proprietor.
