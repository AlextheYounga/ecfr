When, in the opinion of the appropriate TTB officer, the interests of the Government demand it, or in any case where the validity of the bond becomes impaired in whole or in part for any reason, the principal will be required to give a new bond.

Executors, administrators, assignees, receivers, trustees, or other persons acting in a fiduciary capacity, to continue or to liquidate the business of the principal, will execute and file a new bond or obtain the consent of the surety or sureties on the existing bond or bonds. When under the provisions of ยง 24.157 the surety has filed an application to be relieved of liability under any bond given under this part and the principal desires or intends to continue business or operations to which the bond relates, the principal shall file a valid superseding bond to be effective on or before the date specified in the surety's notice. New or superseding bonds will show the current date of execution and the effective date.
