(c) *Boundaries.* The Santa Lucia Highlands viticultural area is located in Monterey County, California. The beginning point is found on the “Chualar, California” U.S.G.S. map, where Limekiln Creek crosses the 360 foot contour interval. This point also coincides with the western boundary of the Guadalupe Y Llanitos de los Correos Land Grant and the eastern boundary of section 28, T. 16S., R. 4E. The boundary is as follows:

(1) From the beginning point the boundary follows Limekiln Creek for approximately 1.25 miles northeast to the 100 foot elevation.

(2) Then following the 100 foot contour in a southeasterly direction for approximately 1 mile, where the boundary intersects the west bank of the Salinas River.

(3) Then following the west bank of the Salinas River in a southeasterly direction on the Gonzales, California U.S.G.S. map for approximately 2.50 miles to the point on the Palo Escrito Peak, California U.S.G.S. map where the river channel crosses the 120 foot elevation.

(4) Then following the 120 foot elevation due south for approximately 2,200 feet where it climbs to the 160 foot elevation.

(5) Then following the 160 foot elevation in a southeasterly direction for approximately 6.50 miles, to the point where the 160 foot elevation crosses River Road.

(6) Then following River Road in a southeasterly direction for approximately 1 mile to the junction of River, Fort Romie and Foothill Roads.

(7) Then following Foothill Road in a southeasterly direction for approximately 4 miles to the junction of Foothill and Paraiso Roads on the Soledad, California U.S.G.S. map.

(8) Then following Paraiso Road in a southerly direction to the intersection with Clark Road on the Paraiso Springs, California U.S.G.S. map.

(9) Then east-northeasterly along Clark Road for approximately 1,000 feet to its intersection with an unnamed light-duty road to the south.

(10) Then in a straight south-southeasterly line for approximately 1.9 miles to the line's intersection with the southeast corner of section 33, T18S, R6E (this line coincides with the unnamed light duty road for about 0.4 miles and then with the eastern boundaries of sections 29, 32 and 33, T18S, R6E, which mark this portion of the western boundary of the historical Arroyo Seco Land Grant).

(11) Then straight west along the southern boundaries of sections 33, 32, and 31, T18S, R6E, to the southwest corner of section 31.

(12) Then north along the western boundaries of sections 31 and 30, to the northwestern corner of section 30 T. 18S., R. 6E.

(13) Then northwest in a straight diagonal line to the northwest corner of section 24, T. 18S., R. 5E on the Sycamore Flat, California U.S.G.S. map.

(14) Then north along the western boundary of section 13, T. 18S., R. 5E., to the northwestern corner of section 13, T. 18S., R. 5E.

(15) Then northwest in a diagonal line across sections 11 and 3, to the northwest corner of section 3, T. 18S., R. 5E on the Palo Escrito Peak, California U.S.G.S. map.

(16) Then due west along the southern boundary of section 33, T. 17S., R. 5E., to the southwestern corner of section 33, T. 17S., R. 5E.

(17) Then north along the western boundary of section 33 to the southeast corner of section 29, T. 17S., R. 5E.

(18) Then northwest in a diagonal line through sections 29, 19, 13, and 11, to the northwest corner of section 11, T. 17S., R. 4E on the Rana Creek, California U.S.G.S. map.

(19) Then north along the western boundary of section 2, T. 17S., R. 4E., to the northwestern corner of section 2, T. 17S., R. 4E.

(20) Then west along the southern boundary of section 34, T. 16S., R. 4E., to the southwestern corner of section 34, T. 16S., R. 4E.

(21) Then north along the eastern boundary of sections 33 and 28, T. 16S., R. 4E., for approximately 1 mile, to the point where the eastern boundary of section 28 T. 165., R. 4E., coincides with the western boundary of the Guadalupe Y Llanitos de los Correos Land Grant on the Chualar, California U.S.G.S. map.

(22) Then northwest along the grant line for approximately 2,500 feet to the point of beginning on Limekiln Creek.
