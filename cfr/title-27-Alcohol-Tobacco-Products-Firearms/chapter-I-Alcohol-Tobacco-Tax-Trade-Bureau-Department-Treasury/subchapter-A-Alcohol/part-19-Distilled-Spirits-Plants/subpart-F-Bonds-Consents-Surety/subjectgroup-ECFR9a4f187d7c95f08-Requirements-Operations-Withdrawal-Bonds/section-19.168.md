##### ยง 19.168 Superseding bonds. #####

(a) *General.* In any of the circumstances outlined in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section, the proprietor must replace an existing bond with a new bond. A new bond that replaces another bond is called a superseding bond.

(b) *Surety company no longer acceptable.* The proprietor must file a superseding bond if the surety on the proprietor's current bond becomes insolvent or if the surety is removed from the list of approved sureties in Treasury Circular 570. TTB may also require the filing of a superseding bond if any other contingency affecting the validity or efficiency of the bond arises.

(c) *Change of control.* An executor, administrator, assignee, receiver, trustee, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, continuing or liquidating the business of the principal on a bond, must either provide TTB with a superseding bond, or obtain consent from the surety on each existing bond when assuming control of the business.

(d) *Termination of bond by surety.* If the surety applies to terminate a bond under ยง 19.171, and the proprietor wishes to continue the activity covered by the bond, the proprietor must file a superseding bond that becomes effective on or before the termination date of the existing bond. The superseding bond must show both its execution date and its effective date.
