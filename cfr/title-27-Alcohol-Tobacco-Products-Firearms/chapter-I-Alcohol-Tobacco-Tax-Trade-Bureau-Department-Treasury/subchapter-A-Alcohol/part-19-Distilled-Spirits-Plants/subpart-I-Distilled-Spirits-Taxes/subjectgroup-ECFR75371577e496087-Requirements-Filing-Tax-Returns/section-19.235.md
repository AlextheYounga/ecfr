##### ยง 19.235 Deferred payment return periods - quarterly and semimonthly. #####

(a) *Two types of return periods.* The IRC provides for two different return periods for those taxpayers who pay their taxes on a deferred basis: Quarterly and semimonthly. Small taxpayers that meet certain criteria are eligible to use quarterly return periods and pay their taxes on a quarterly basis. Larger taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods and pay their taxes on a semimonthly basis.

(b) *Quarterly return period.* Effective January 1, 2006, a taxpayer that reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in taxes with respect to distilled spirits imposed by 26 U.S.C. 5001 and 7652 for the current calendar year, and that was liable for not more than $50,000 in such taxes in the preceding calendar year, may choose to use a quarterly return period. However, the taxpayer may not use the quarterly return period procedure for any portion of the calendar year following the first date on which the aggregate amount of tax due from the taxpayer during the calendar year exceeds $50,000, and any tax which has not been paid on that date will be due on the 14th day after the last day of the semimonthly period in which that date occurs. The following additional rules apply to the quarterly return period procedure under this section:

(1) A taxpayer with multiple locations must combine the distilled spirits tax liability for all locations to determine eligibility for the quarterly return procedure;

(2) A taxpayer that has both domestic operations and import transactions must combine the distilled spirits tax liability on the domestic operations and the imports to determine eligibility for the quarterly return procedure;

(3) The controlled group rules of 26 U.S.C. 5061(e), which concern treatment of controlled groups as one taxpayer, do not apply for purposes of determining eligibility for the quarterly return procedure. However, a taxpayer that is eligible for the quarterly return procedure, and that is a member of a controlled group that owes $5 million or more in distilled spirits excise taxes per year, is required to pay taxes by electronic fund transfer (EFT). Quarterly payments via EFT must be transmitted in accordance with section 5061(e);

(4) A new taxpayer is eligible to file quarterly returns in the first year of business simply if the taxpayer reasonably expects to be liable for not more than $50,000 in distilled spirits taxes during that calendar year; and

(5) If a taxpayer filing quarterly exceeds $50,000 in tax liability during a taxable year and therefore must revert to the semimonthly return procedure, that taxpayer may resume quarterly payments only after a full calendar year has passed during which the taxpayer's liability did not exceed $50,000.

(c) *Semimonthly return period.* Except in the case of a taxpayer that qualifies for, and chooses to use, quarterly return periods as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all other taxpayers must use semimonthly return periods for deferred payment of tax. The semimonthly return periods will run from the 1st day through the 15th day of each month, and from the 16th day through the last day of each month, except as otherwise provided in ยง 19.237.

(d) *Definitions.* For purposes of this section, the following terms have the meanings indicated:

*Reasonably expects.* When used with reference to a taxpayer, *reasonably expects* means that there is no existing or anticipated circumstances known to the taxpayer (such as an increase in production capacity) that would cause the taxpayer's tax liability to exceed the prescribed limit.

*Taxpayer.* A *taxpayer* is an individual, corporation, partnership, or other entity that is assigned a single Employer Identification Number (EIN) as defined in 26 CFR 301.7702.12.
