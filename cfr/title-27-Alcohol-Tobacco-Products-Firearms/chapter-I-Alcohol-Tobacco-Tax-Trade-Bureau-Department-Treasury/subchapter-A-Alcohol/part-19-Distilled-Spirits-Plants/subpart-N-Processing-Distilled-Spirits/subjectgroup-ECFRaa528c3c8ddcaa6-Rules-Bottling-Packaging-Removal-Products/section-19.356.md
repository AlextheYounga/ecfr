Proprietors must record the results of all tests of alcohol content and quantity (fill) in the record required by ยง 19.600.

(b) *Variations in fill.* Quantity (fill) must be kept as close to 100 percent fill as the equipment and bottles in use will permit.

In no case will the quantity contained in a bottle vary from the quantity stated on the label or bottle by more than plus or minus:

(1) 1.5 percent for bottles 1.0 liter and above;

(2) 2.0 percent for bottles 999 mL through 376 mL;

(3) 3.0 percent for bottles 375 mL through 101 mL; or

(4) 4.5 percent for bottles 100 mL and below.

(d) *Example.* Under paragraph (c) of this section, a product with a solids content of less than 600 mg per 100 ml, labeled as containing 40 percent alcohol by volume and bottled in a 750 ml bottle, would be acceptable if the test for alcohol content found that it contained 39.85 percent alcohol by volume.
