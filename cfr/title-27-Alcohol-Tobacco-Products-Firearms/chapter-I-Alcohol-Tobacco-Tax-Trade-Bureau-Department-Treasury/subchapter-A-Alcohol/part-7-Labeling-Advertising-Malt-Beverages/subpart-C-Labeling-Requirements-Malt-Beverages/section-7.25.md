(a) *Domestic malt beverages.* (1) On labels of containers of domestic malt beverages there shall be stated the name of the bottler or packer and the place where bottled or packed. The bottler's or packer's principal place of business may be shown in lieu of the actual place where bottled or packed if the address shown is a location where bottling or packing operation takes place. The appropriate TTB officer may disapprove the listing of a principal place of business if its use would create a false or misleading impression as to the geographic origin of the beer.

(2) If malt beverages are bottled or packed for a person other than the actual bottler or packer there may be stated in addition to the name and address of the bottler or packer (but not in lieu of), the name and address of such other person immediately preceded by the words “bottled for,” “distributed by,” or other similar appropriate phrase.

(b) *Imported malt beverages.* On labels of containers of imported malt beverages, there shall be stated the words “imported by,” or a singular appropriate phrase, and immediately thereafter the name of the permittee who is the importer, or exclusive agent, or sole distributor, or other person responsible for the importation, together with the principal place of business in the United States of such person. In addition there may, but need not, be stated unless required by State or foreign law or regulation the name and principal place of business of the foreign manufacturer, bottler, packer, or shipper.

(c) *Post-office address.* The “place” stated shall be the post-office address, except that the street address may be omitted. No additional places or addresses shall be stated for the same person, unless (1) such person is actively engaged in the conduct of an additional bona fide and actual malt beverage business at such additional place or address, and (2) the label also contains, in direct conjunction therewith, appropriate descriptive material indicating the function occurring at such additional place or address in connection with the particular malt beverage.
