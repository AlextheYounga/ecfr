(a) The specific gravity hydrometers furnished by proprietors to appropriate TTB officers shall conform to the standard specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) for such instruments. Such specific gravity hydrometers shall be of a precision grade, standardization temperature 60 °/60 °F., and provided in the following ranges and subdivisions:

|     Range      |Subdivision|
|----------------|-----------|
|1.0000 to 1.0500|  0.0005   |

|1.1000 to 1.1500|  0.0005   |
|1.1500 to 1.2000|  0.0005   |
|1.2000 to 1.2500|  0.0005   |

No instrument shall be in error by more than 0.0005 specific gravity.

(b) A certificate of accuracy prepared by the instrument manufacturer for the instrument shall be furnished to the appropriate TTB officer.
