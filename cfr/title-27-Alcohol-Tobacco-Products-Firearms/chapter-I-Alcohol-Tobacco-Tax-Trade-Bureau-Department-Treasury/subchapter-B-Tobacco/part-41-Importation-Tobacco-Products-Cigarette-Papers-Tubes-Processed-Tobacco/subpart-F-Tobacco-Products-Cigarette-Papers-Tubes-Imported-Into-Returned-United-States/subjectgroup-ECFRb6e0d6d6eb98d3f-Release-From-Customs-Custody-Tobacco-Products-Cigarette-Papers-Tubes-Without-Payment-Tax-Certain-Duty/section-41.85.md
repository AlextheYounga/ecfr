(2) Cigarette papers and tubes manufactured in a foreign country, the Virgin Islands, or a possession of the United States, for transfer to the factory of manufacturer of cigarette papers and tubes, to an export warehouse proprietor, or to a manufacturer of tobacco products solely for use in the manufacture of cigarettes.
