##### § 46.222 Determination of amount of tax due. #####

After the dealer has taken the inventory, the dealer must convert the inventory quantities to taxable units using the table below. For tobacco products, round the quantities to two decimal places. The dealer must then apply the applicable tax rate for each type of taxable article using the table in § 46.221 to determine the amount of tax due.
