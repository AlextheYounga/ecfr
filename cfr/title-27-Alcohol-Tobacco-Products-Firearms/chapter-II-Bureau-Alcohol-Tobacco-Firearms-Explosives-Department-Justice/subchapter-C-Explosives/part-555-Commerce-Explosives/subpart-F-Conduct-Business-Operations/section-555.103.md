(iv) Where possession of explosive materials is transferred at the distributor's premises, the distributor must in all instances verify the identity of the person accepting possession on behalf of the distributee before relinquishing possession. Before the delivery at the distributor's premises of explosive materials to an employee of a licensee or permittee, or to an employee of a common or contract carrier transporting explosive materials to a licensee or permittee, the distributor delivering explosive materials must obtain an executed ATF F 5400.8, Explosives Delivery Record, from the employee before releasing the explosive materials. The ATF F 5400.8 must contain all of the information required on the form and required by this part.

a. An employee of the purchaser takes possession at the distributor's premises.

b. An employee of a common or contract carrier hired by the purchaser takes possession at the distributor's premises.

Example 2.An ATF F 5400.8 is not required when:

b. An employee of a common or contract carrier hired by the distributor takes possession of the explosives for the purpose of transport to the purchaser.

(2) *License/permit verification of individuals.* (i) The distributee must furnish a certified copy (or, in the case of a user-limited, the original) of the license or permit. The certified copy need be furnished only once during the current term of the license or permit. Also, a licensee need not furnish certified copies of licenses to other licensed locations operated by such licensee.

(ii) The distributor may obtain any additional verification as the distributor deems necessary.

(3) *License/permit verification of business organizations.* (i) A business organization may (in lieu of furnishing a certified copy of a license) furnish the distributor a certified list which contains the name, address, license number and date of license expiration of each licensed location. The certified list need be furnished only once during the current term of the license or permit. Also, a business organization need not furnish a certified list to other licensed locations operated by such business organization.

(ii) A business organization must, prior to ordering explosive materials, furnish the licensee or permittee a current certified list of the representatives or agents authorized to order explosive materials on behalf of the business organization showing the name, address, and date and place of birth of each representative or agent. A licensee or permittee may not distribute explosive materials to a business organization on the order of a person who does not appear on the certified list of representatives or agents and, if the person does appear on the certified list, the licensee or permittee must verify the identity of such person.

(4) *Licensee/permittee certified statement.* (i) A licensee or permittee ordering explosive materials from another licensee or permittee must furnish a current, certified statement of the intended use of the explosive materials, *e.g.,* resale, mining, quarrying, agriculture, construction, sport rocketry, road building, oil well drilling, seismographic research, to the distributor.

(b) *Transactions among licensees/permittees on and after May 24, 2003* - (1) *General.* (i) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or licensed dealer selling or otherwise distributing explosive materials (or a holder of a user permit disposing of surplus stock to a licensee; a holder of a user permit; or a holder of a limited permit who is within the same State as the distributor) who has the certified information required by this section may sell or distribute explosive materials to a licensee or permittee for not more than 45 days following the expiration date of the distributee's license or permit, unless the distributor knows or has reason to believe that the distributee's authority to continue business or operations under this part has been terminated.

(ii) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or licensed dealer selling or otherwise distributing explosive materials (or a holder of a user permit disposing of surplus stock to another licensee or permittee) must verify the license or permit status of the distributee prior to the release of explosive materials ordered, as required by this section.

(2) *Verification of license/user permit.* (i) Prior to or with the first order of explosive materials, the distributee must provide the distributor a certified copy (or, in the case of a user-limited, the original) of the distributee's license or user permit.

A distributor may not transfer possession of explosive materials to any person whose name does not appear on the current list of names of persons authorized to accept delivery of explosive materials on behalf of the distributee. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, in all instances the distributor must verify the identity of the distributee, or the employee of the distributee accepting possession of explosive materials on behalf of the distributee, by examining an identification document (as defined in § 555.11) before relinquishing possession.

(iii) A licensee or holder of a user permit ordering explosive materials from another licensee or permittee must provide to the distributor a current, certified statement of the intended use of the explosive materials, *e.g.,* resale, mining, quarrying, agriculture, construction, sport rocketry, road building, oil well drilling, seismographic research, etc.

(i) Verify the identity of the person accepting possession for the common or contract carrier by examining such person's valid, unexpired driver's license issued by any State, Canada, or Mexico; and

(ii) Record the name of the common or contract carrier (*i.e.,* the name of the driver's employer) and the full name of the driver. This information must be maintained in the distributor's permanent records in accordance with § 555.121.

(4) *User-limited permit transactions.* A user-limited permit issued under the provisions of this part is valid for only a single purchase transaction and is not renewable (see § 555.51). Accordingly, at the time a user-limited permittee orders explosive materials, the licensed distributor must write on the front of the user-limited permit the transaction date, his signature, and the distributor's license number prior to returning the permit to the user-limited permittee.
