Table: National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Official Standard No. 492, 1968Notes of Table of Separation Distances of Ammonium Nitrate and Blasting Agents From Explosives or Blasting Agents

(1) This table specifies separation distances to prevent explosion of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based blasting agents by propagation from nearby stores of high explosives or blasting agents referred to in the table as the “donor.” Ammonium nitrate, by itself, is not considered to be a donor when applying this table. Ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate-fuel oil or combinations thereof are acceptors. If stores of ammonium nitrate are located within the sympathetic detonation distance of explosives or blasting agents, one-half the mass of the ammonium nitrate is to be included in the mass of the donor.

(2) When the ammonium nitrate and/or blasting agent is not barricaded, the distances shown in the table must be multiplied by six. These distances allow for the possibility of high velocity metal fragments from mixers, hoppers, truck bodies, sheet metal structures, metal containers, and the like which may enclose the “donor.” Where explosives storage is in bullet-resistant magazines or where the storage is protected by a bullet-resistant wall, distances and barricade thicknesses in excess of those prescribed in the table in § 555.218 are not required.

(3) These distances apply to all ammonium nitrate with respect to its separation from stores of high explosives and blasting agents. Ammonium nitrate explosive mixtures that are high explosives pursuant to § 555.202(a) or are defined as a blasting agent pursuant to § 555.11 are subject to the table of distances for storage of explosive materials in § 555.218 and to the table of separation distances of ammonium nitrate and blasting agents from explosives or blasting agents in this section.

(4) These distances apply to blasting agents which pass the insensitivity test prescribed in regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation (49 CFR part 173).

(5) Earth or sand dikes, or enclosures filled with the prescribed minimum thickness of earth or sand are acceptable artificial barricades. Natural barricades, such as hills or timber of sufficient density that the surrounding exposures which require protection cannot be seen from the “donor” when the trees are bare of leaves, are also acceptable.

(6) For determining the distances to be maintained from inhabited buildings, passenger railways, and public highways, use the table in § 555.218.
