##### ยง 29.21-6 Disposal, transfer or termination of interest. #####

(a) *Change in jurisdiction over and disposal of lands.* The final disposal by the United States of any tract of land traversed by a right-of-way shall not be construed to be a revocation of the right-of-way in whole or in part, but such final disposition shall be deemed and taken to be subject to such right-of-way unless it has been specifically canceled.

(b) *Transfer of easement or permit.* Any proposed transfer, by assignment, lease, operating agreement or otherwise, of an easement or permit must be filed in triplicate with the Regional Director and must be supported by a stipulation that the transferee agrees to comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions of the original grant. A $25 nonreturnable service fee must accompany the proposal. No transfer will be recognized unless and until approved in writing by the Regional Director.

(c) *Disposal of property on termination of right-of-way.* In the absence of any agreement to the contrary, the holder of the right-of-way will be allowed 6 months after termination to remove all property or improvements other than a road and useable improvements to a road, placed thereon by him; otherwise, all such property and improvements shall become the property of the United States. Extensions of time may be granted at the discretion of the Regional Director.
