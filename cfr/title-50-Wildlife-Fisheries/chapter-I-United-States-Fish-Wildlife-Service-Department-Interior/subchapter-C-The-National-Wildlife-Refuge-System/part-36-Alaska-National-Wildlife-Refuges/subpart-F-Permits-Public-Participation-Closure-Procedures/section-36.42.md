(a) *Applicability and authority.* The Refuge Manager may close an area or restrict an activity in an Alaska National Wildlife Refuge on an emergency, temporary, or permanent basis in accordance with this section.

(b) *Criteria.* In determining whether to close an area or restrict an activity otherwise allowed, the Refuge Manager shall be guided by factors such as public health and safety, resource protection, protection of cultural or scientific values, subsistence uses, endangered or threatened species conservation, and other management considerations necessary to ensure that the activity or area is being managed in a manner compatible with the purposes for which the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge area was established.

(3) Other emergency closures or restrictions will become effective upon notice as prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section; and

(4) No emergency closure or restriction will exceed 60 days. Closures or restrictions requiring longer than 60 days will follow nonemergency closure procedures (*i.e.,* temporary or permanent; see paragraphs (d) and (e), respectively, of this section).

Temporary closures or restrictions related to the taking of fish and wildlife also require consultation with the State and affected Tribes and Native Corporations.

(3) Other temporary closures will be effective upon notice as set forth at paragraph (f) of this section.

(4) Temporary closures or restrictions will extend only for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose of the closure or restriction, and may not exceed 12 months; *Provided, however,* a new temporary closure or restriction may be adopted thereafter by following the applicable procedures set forth at paragraph (d)(1), (d)(2), or (d)(3) of this section.

(e) *Permanent closures or restrictions.* Permanent closures or restrictions related to the use of aircraft, snowmachines, motorboats, or nonmotorized surface transportation, or taking of fish and wildlife, will be effective only after notice pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, and shall be published by rulemaking in the Federal Register with a minimum public comment period of 60 days and shall not be effective until after a public hearing(s) is held in the affected vicinity and other locations as appropriate. Permanent closures or restrictions related to the taking of fish and wildlife require consultation with the State and affected Tribes and Native Corporations.

(f) *Notice.* Emergency, temporary, or permanent closures or restrictions will be published on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Web site at *http://www.fws.gov/alaska/nwr/ak\_sp\_hunt\_regs.htm*. Additional means of notice reasonably likely to inform residents in the affected vicinity will also be provided where available, such as:
