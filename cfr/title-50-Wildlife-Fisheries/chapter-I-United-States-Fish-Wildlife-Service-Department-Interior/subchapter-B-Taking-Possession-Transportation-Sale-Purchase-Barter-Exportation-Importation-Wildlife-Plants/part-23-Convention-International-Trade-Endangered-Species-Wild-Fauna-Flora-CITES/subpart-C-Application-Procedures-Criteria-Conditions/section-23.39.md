(d) *Exemption.* As allowed under Article XIV(4) and (5) of the Treaty, you may directly introduce into the United States any Appendix-II wildlife or plant taken in the marine environment that is not under the jurisdiction of any country without a CITES document when all of the following conditions are met:

(2) The ship that harvested the specimen is registered in the United States.

(4) The shipment is accompanied by any official document required under the other international treaty, convention, or agreement or otherwise required by U.S. law.

(e) *Export of exempt specimens.* To export a specimen exempted under paragraph (d) of this section, you must obtain a CITES document from the U.S. Management Authority that indicates the specimen was taken in accordance with the provisions of the other international treaty, convention, or agreement that was in force on July 1, 1975.
