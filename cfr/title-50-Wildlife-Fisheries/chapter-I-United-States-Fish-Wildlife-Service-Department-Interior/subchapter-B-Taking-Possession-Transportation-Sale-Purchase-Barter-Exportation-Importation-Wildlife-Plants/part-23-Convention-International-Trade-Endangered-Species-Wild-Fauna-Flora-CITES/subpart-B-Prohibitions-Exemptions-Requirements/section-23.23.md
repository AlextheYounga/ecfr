##### § 23.23 What information is required on U.S. and foreign CITES documents? #####

(a) *Purpose.* Article VI of the Treaty provides standard information that must be on a permit and certificate issued under Articles III, IV, and V. To identify a false or invalid document, any CITES document, including a CITES exemption document issued under Article VII, must contain standardized information to allow a Party to verify that the specimen being shipped is the one listed on the document and that the trade is consistent with the provisions of the Treaty.

(b) *CITES form.* A CITES document issued by a Party must be issued in one or more of the three working languages of CITES (English, Spanish, or French). A CITES document from a non-Party may be in the form of a permit or certificate, letter, or any other form that clearly indicates the nature of the document and includes the information in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section and the additional information in § 23.25.

(c) *Required information.* Except for a phytosanitary certificate used as a CITES certificate for artificially propagated plants in paragraph (f) of this section, or a customs declaration label used to identify specimens being moved between registered scientific institutions (§ 23.48(e)(5)), a CITES document issued by a Party or non-Party must contain the information set out in this paragraph (listed alphabetically). Specific types of CITES documents must also contain the additional information identified in paragraph (e) of this section. A CITES document is valid only when it contains the following information:

General descriptions such as “one case” or “one batch” are not acceptable.  <br/>(ii) Weight should be in kilograms. If weight is used, net weight (weight of the specimen alone) must be stated, not gross weight that includes the weight of the container or packaging.  <br/>(iii) Volume should be in cubic meters for logs and sawn wood and either square meters or cubic meters for veneer and plywood.  <br/>(iv) For re-export, if the type of good has not changed since being imported, the same unit of measurement as on the export permit must be used, except to change to units that are to be used in the CITES annual report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Scientific names must be in the standard nomenclature as it appears in the CITES Appendices or the references adopted by the CoP. A list of current references is available from the CITES website or us (see § 23.7). A CITES document may contain higher-taxon names in  <br/>(i) The CoP has agreed that the use of a higher-taxon name is acceptable for use on CITES documents.  <br/>(A) If the genus cannot be readily determined for coral rock, the scientific name to be used is the order Scleractinia.  <br/>(B) If the species cannot be determined for worked specimens of black coral, specimens may be identified at the genus level. If the genus cannot be determined for worked specimens of black coral, the scientific name to be used is the order Antipatharia. Raw black coral and live black coral must be identified to the level of species.  <br/>(C) Live and dead coral must be identified to the level of species except where the CoP has agreed that identification to genus is acceptable. A current list of coral taxa identifiable to genus is available from the CITES website or us (see § 23.7).  <br/>(D) Re-export of worked skins or pieces of Tupinambis species that were imported before August 1, 2000, may indicate Tupinambis spp.  <br/>(ii) The issuing Party can show the use of a higher-taxon name is well justified and has communicated the justification to the Secretariat.  <br/>(iii) The item is a pre-Convention manufactured product containing a specimen that cannot be identified to the species level.|
