Mariana Fruit Bat (*Pteropus mariannus mariannus*)

(1) The critical habitat unit for the Mariana fruit bat is depicted for the Territory of Guam on the maps below.

(2) Within this area, the primary constituent elements required by the Mariana fruit bat for the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, roosting, and rearing of young are found in areas supporting limestone, secondary, ravine, swamp, agricultural, and coastal forests composed of native or introduced plant species. These forest types provide the primary constituent elements of:

(i) Plant species used for foraging, such as *Artocarpus* sp. (breadfruit), *Carica papaya* (papaya), *Cycas circinalis* (fadang), *Ficus* spp. (fig), *Pandanus tectorius* (kafu), *Cocos nucifera* (coconut palm), and *Terminalia catappa* (talisai); and

(ii) Remote locations, often within 328 ft (100 m) of clifflines that are 260 to 590 ft (80 to 100 m) tall, with limited exposure to human disturbance; land that contains mature fig, *Mammea odorata* (chopak), *Casuarina equisetifolia* (gago), *Macaranga thompsonii* (pengua), *Guettarda speciosa* (panao), *Neisosperma oppositifolia* (fagot), and other tree species that are used for roosting and breeding.

(3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and structures within the boundaries of the mapped units, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) The critical habitat unit is described below. Coordinates are in UTM Zone 55 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83)/World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84).

![](/graphics/ec01jn91.009.gif)Polar Bear (*Ursus maritimus*) in the United States

(1) Critical habitat areas are in the State of Alaska, and adjacent territorial and U.S. waters, as described below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the polar bear in the United States are:

(i) Sea-ice habitat used for feeding, breeding, denning, and movements, which is sea ice over waters 300 m (984.2 ft) or less in depth that occurs over the continental shelf with adequate prey resources (primarily ringed and bearded seals) to support polar bears.

(ii) Terrestrial denning habitat, which includes topographic features, such as coastal bluffs and river banks, with the following suitable macrohabitat characteristics:

(A) Steep, stable slopes (range 15.5-50.0°), with heights ranging from 1.3 to 34 m (4.3 to 111.6 ft), and with water or relatively level ground below the slope and relatively flat terrain above the slope;

(B) Unobstructed, undisturbed access between den sites and the coast;

(C) Sea ice in proximity to terrestrial denning habitat prior to the onset of denning during the fall to provide access to terrestrial den sites; and

(D) The absence of disturbance from humans and human activities that might attract other polar bears.

(iii) Barrier island habitat used for denning, refuge from human disturbance, and movements along the coast to access maternal den and optimal feeding habitat, which includes all barrier islands along the Alaska coast and their associated spits, within the range of the polar bear in the United States, and the water, ice, and terrestrial habitat within 1.6 km (1 mi) of these islands (no-disturbance zone).

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (e.g., houses, gravel roads, generator plants, sewage treatment plants, hotels, docks, seawalls, pipelines) and the land on which they are located existing within the boundaries of designated critical habitat on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Boundaries were derived from GIS data layers of the 1:63,360 scale digital coastline of the State of Alaska, created by the Alaska Department of Natural Resources from U.S. Geological Survey inch-to-the-mile topographic quadrangles. The International Bathymetric Chart of the Arctic Ocean, version 2.3, was used for the bathymetric data. The maritime boundaries to generate the 3-mile nautical line, U.S. territorial boundary, and Exclusive Economic Zone were from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Coast Survey Web site. The land status and ownership information at the section level scale was from the Alaska Department of Natural Resources, and was obtained from the Alaska State Office of the Bureau of Land Management. The detailed parcel-level land status was created by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of the Realty, by digitizing U.S. Bureau of Land Management Master Title Plots. The detailed denning habitat maps and the internal boundaries for the terrestrial denning habitat were provided by the U.S. Geological Survey, Alaska Science Center. The data were projected into Alaska Standard Albers Conical Equal Area using the North American Datum of 1983 to estimate the area of each critical habitat unit and determine overlap with land and water ownership.

(5) Unit 1: Sea-ice habitat.

(i) The critical sea-ice habitat area includes all the contiguous waters from the mean high tide line of the mainland coast of Alaska to the 300-m (984.2-ft) bathymetry contour. The critical sea-ice habitat is bounded on the east by the United States-Canada border (69.64892° N, 141.00533° W) and extends along the coastline to a point southwest of Hooper Bay (61.52859° N, 166.15476° W) on the western coast of Alaska. The eastern boundary extends offshore approximately 85 km (136 mi) from the coast (70.41526° N, 141.0076° W) at the United States-Canada border and then follows the 300-m (984.2-ft) bathymetry contour northwest until it intersects with the U.S. 200-nautical-mile EEZ (74.01403° N, 163.52341° W). The boundary then follows the EEZ boundary southwest to the intersection with the United States-Russian boundary (72.78333° N, 168.97694° W). From this point, the boundary follows the United States-Russia boundary south and southwest to the intersection with the southern boundary of the Chukchi-Bering Seas population southwest of Gambell, St Lawrence Island (62.55482° N, 173.68023° W). From this point, the boundary extends southeast to the coast of Alaska (61.52859° N, 166.15476° W).

(1) A critical habitat unit is depicted for Boundary County, Idaho, and Pend Oreille County, Washington, on the map below.

(2) Within this area, the primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou consist of five components:

(i) Mature to old-growth western hemlock (*Tsuga heterophylla*)/western red cedar (*Thuja plicata*) climax forest, and subalpine fir (*Abies lasiocarpa*)/Engelmann spruce (*Picea engelmanni*) climax forest at least 5,000 ft (1,520 m) in elevation; these habitats typically have 26-50 percent or greater canopy closure.

(ii) Ridge tops and high elevation basins that are generally 6,000 ft (1,830 m) in elevation or higher, associated with mature to old stands of subalpine fir (*Abies lasiocarpa*)/Engelmann spruce (*Picea engelmanni*) climax forest, with relatively open canopy.

(iii) Presence of arboreal hair lichens.

(iv) High-elevation benches and shallow slopes, secondary stream bottoms, riparian areas, and seeps, and subalpine meadows with succulent forbs and grasses, flowering plants, horsetails, willow, huckleberry, dwarf birch, sedges and lichens. The southern Selkirk Mountains population of woodland caribou, including pregnant females, uses these areas for feeding during the spring and summer seasons.

(v) Corridors/Transition zones that connect the habitats described above. If human activities occur, they are such that they do not impair the ability of caribou to use these areas.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on December 28, 2012.

(4) *Critical habitat map unit.* Data layers defining the map unit were created using a 5,000-ft (1,520-m) elevation layer derived from 30m USGS DEM plus migration-corridor polygons, and units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 11N coordinates. The map in this entry establishes the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which the map is based are available to the public at the field office Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/idaho*), at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R1-ES-2011-0096, and at the Service's Idaho Fish and Wildlife Office. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(ii) Winter conditions that provide and maintain deep fluffy snow for extended periods of time;

(iii) Sites for denning that have abundant coarse woody debris, such as downed trees and root wads; and

(iv) Matrix habitat (e.g., hardwood forest, dry forest, non-forest, or other habitat types that do not support snowshoe hares) that occurs between patches of boreal forest in close juxtaposition (at the scale of a lynx home range) such that lynx are likely to travel through such habitat while accessing patches of boreal forest within a home range.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on October 14, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using a USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic projection. The maps in this entry establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's internet site, *http://www.fws.gov/montanafieldoffice/*, at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R6-ES-2013-0101, and at the field office responsible for this designation.

Alabama Beach Mouse (*Peromyscus polionotus ammobates*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Baldwin County, Alabama, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Alabama Beach Mouse are the habitat components that provide:

(i) A contiguous mosaic of primary, secondary, and scrub vegetation and dune structure, with a balanced level of competition and predation and few or no competitive or predaceous nonnative species present, that collectively provide foraging opportunities, cover, and burrow sites.

(ii) Primary and secondary dunes, generally dominated by sea oats (*Uniola paniculata*), that despite occasional temporary impacts and reconfiguration from tropical storms and hurricanes, provide abundant food resources, burrow sites, and protection from predators.

(iii) Scrub dunes, generally dominated by scrub oaks (*Quercus* spp.), that provide food resources and burrow sites, and provide elevated refugia during and after intense flooding due to rainfall and/or hurricane-induced storm surge.

(iv) Unobstructed habitat connections that facilitate genetic exchange, dispersal, natural exploratory movements, and recolonization of locally extirpated areas.

(v) A natural light regime within the coastal dune ecosystem, compatible with the nocturnal activity of beach mice, necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airport runways, roads, other paved areas, and piers) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were created by delineating habitats that contained one or more of the PCEs defined in paragraph (2) of this entry, over 2005 Baldwin County, Alabama color photography (UTM 16, NAD 83).

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Okaloosa, Walton, and Bay Counties, Florida, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Choctawhatchee beach mouse are the habitat components that provide:

(i) A contiguous mosaic of primary, secondary, and scrub vegetation and dune structure, with a balanced level of competition and predation and few or no competitive or predaceous nonnative species present, that collectively provide foraging opportunities, cover, and burrow sites;

(ii) Primary and secondary dunes, generally dominated by sea oats (*Uniola paniculata*), that despite occasional temporary impacts and reconfiguration from tropical storms and hurricanes, provide abundant food resources, burrow sites, and protection from predators;

(iii) Scrub dunes, generally dominated by scrub oaks (*Quercus* spp.), that provide food resources and burrow sites, and provide elevated refugia during and after intense flooding due to rainfall and/or hurricane-induced storm surge;

(iv) Functional, unobstructed habitat connections that facilitate genetic exchange, dispersal, natural exploratory movements, and re-colonization of locally extirpated areas; and

(v) A natural light regime within the coastal dune ecosystem, compatible with the nocturnal activity of beach mice, necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(3) Critical habitat does not include man-made structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, driveways, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.

(4) *Critical Habitat Map Units.* Data layers defining map units were created by delineating habitats that contained one or more of the primary constituent elements defined in paragraph (2) of this entry over 1999 and 2004 digital ortho photography at a scale of at least 1:4000.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Colfax, Mora, Otero, Sandoval, and Socorro Counties in New Mexico; Las Animas, Archuleta, and La Plata Counties in Colorado; and Greenlee and Apache Counties in Arizona on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse consist of the following:

(i) Riparian communities along rivers and streams, springs and wetlands, or canals and ditches that contain:

(A) Persistent emergent herbaceous wetlands especially characterized by presence of primarily forbs and sedges (*Carex* spp. or *Schoenoplectus pungens*); or

(B) Scrub-shrub riparian areas that are dominated by willows (*Salix* spp.) or alders (*Alnus* spp.) with an understory of primarily forbs and sedges; and

(ii) Flowing water that provides saturated soils throughout the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse's active season that supports tall (average stubble height of herbaceous vegetation of at least 61 centimeters (24 inches)) and dense herbaceous riparian vegetation composed primarily of sedges (*Carex* spp. or *Schoenoplectus pungens*) and forbs, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following associated species: Spikerush (*Eleocharis macrostachya*), beaked sedge (*Carex rostrata*), rushes (*Juncus* spp. and *Scirpus* spp.), and numerous species of grasses such as bluegrass (*Poa* spp.), slender wheatgrass (*Elymus trachycaulus*), brome (*Bromus* spp.), foxtail barley (*Hordeum jubatum*), or Japanese brome (*Bromus japonicas*), and forbs such as water hemlock (*Circuta douglasii*), field mint (*Mentha arvense*), asters (*Aster* spp.), or cutleaf coneflower (*Rudbeckia laciniata*); and

(iii) Sufficient areas of 9 to 24 kilometers (5.6 to 15 miles) along a stream, ditch, or canal that contain suitable or restorable habitat to support movements of individual New Mexico meadow jumping mice; and

(iv) Adjacent floodplain and upland areas extending approximately 100 meters (330 feet) outward from the boundary between the active water channel and the floodplain (as defined by the bankfull stage of streams) or from the top edge of the ditch or canal.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, fire lookout stations, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on April 15, 2016.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using the USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic USGS version projection. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's internet site *http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/NewMexico/,* at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2013-0014, and at the New Mexico Ecological Services Field Office. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Escambia County, Florida, and Baldwin County, Alabama, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Perdido Key beach mouse are the habitat components that provide:

(i) A contiguous mosaic of primary, secondary, and scrub vegetation and dune structure, with a balanced level of competition and predation and few or no competitive or predaceous nonnative species present, that collectively provide foraging opportunities, cover, and burrow sites;

(ii) Primary and secondary dunes, generally dominated by sea oats (*Uniola paniculata*), that despite occasional temporary impacts and reconfiguration from tropical storms and hurricanes, provide abundant food resources, burrow sites, and protection from predators;

(iii) Scrub dunes, generally dominated by scrub oaks (*Quercus* spp.), that provide food resources and burrow sites, and provide elevated refugia during and after intense flooding due to rainfall and/or hurricane-induced storm surge;

(iv) Functional, unobstructed habitat connections that facilitate genetic exchange, dispersal, natural exploratory movements, and re-colonization of locally extirpated areas; and

(v) A natural light regime within the coastal dune ecosystem, compatible with the nocturnal activity of beach mice, necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(3) Critical habitat does not include man-made structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, driveways, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.

(4) *Critical Habitat Map Units.* Data layers defining map units were created by delineating habitats that contained one or more of the primary constituent elements defined in paragraph (2) of this entry over 1999 and 2004 digital ortho photography at a scale of at least 1:4000.

![](/graphics/er12oc06.006.gif)Preble's Meadow Jumping Mouse (*Zapus hudsonius preblei*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Boulder, Broomfield, Douglas, El Paso, Jefferson, Larimer, and Teller Counties in Colorado on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Preble's meadow jumping mouse are:

(i) Riparian corridors:

(A) Formed and maintained by normal, dynamic, geomorphological, and hydrological processes that create and maintain river and stream channels, floodplains, and floodplain benches and that promote patterns of vegetation favorable to the Preble's meadow jumping mouse;

(B) Containing dense, riparian vegetation consisting of grasses, forbs, or shrubs, or any combination thereof, in areas along rivers and streams that normally provide open water through the Preble's meadow jumping mouse's active season; and

(C) Including specific movement corridors that provide connectivity between and within populations. This may include river and stream reaches with minimal vegetative cover or that are armored for erosion control; travel ways beneath bridges, through culverts, along canals and ditches; and other areas that have experienced substantial human alteration or disturbance.

(ii) Additional adjacent floodplain and upland habitat with limited human disturbance (including hayed fields, grazed pasture, other agricultural lands that are not plowed or disked regularly, areas that have been restored after past aggregate extraction, areas supporting recreational trails, and urban-wildland interfaces).

(3) Critical habitat does not include buildings, roads, parking lots, other paved areas, lawns, other urban and suburban landscaped areas, regularly plowed or disked agricultural areas, and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS digital ortho-photo quarter-quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 15N coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Bay and Gulf Counties, Florida, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the St. Andrew beach mouse are the habitat components that provide:

(i) A contiguous mosaic of primary, secondary, and scrub vegetation and dune structure, with a balanced level of competition and predation and few or no competitive or predaceous nonnative species present, that collectively provide foraging opportunities, cover, and burrow sites;

(ii) Primary and secondary dunes, generally dominated by sea oats (*Uniola paniculata*), that despite occasional temporary impacts and reconfiguration from tropical storms and hurricanes, provide abundant food resources, burrow sites, and protection from predators;

(iii) Scrub dunes, generally dominated by scrub oaks (*Quercus* spp.), that provide food resources and burrow sites, and provide elevated refugia during and after intense flooding due to rainfall and/or hurricane-induced storm surge;

(iv) Functional, unobstructed habitat connections that facilitate genetic exchange, dispersal, natural exploratory movements, and re-colonization of locally extirpated areas; and

(v) A natural light regime within the coastal dune ecosystem, compatible with the nocturnal activity of beach mice, necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(3) Critical habitat does not include man-made structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, driveways, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Kings and Kern Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Buena Vista Lake shrew consist of permanent and intermittent riparian or wetland communities that contain:

(i) A complex vegetative structure with a thick cover of leaf litter or dense mats of low-lying vegetation. Associated plant species can include, but are not limited to, Fremont cottonwoods, willows, glasswort, wild-rye grass, and rush grass. Although moist soil in areas with an overstory of willows or cottonwoods appears to be favored, such overstory may not be essential.

(ii) Suitable moisture supplied by a shallow water table, irrigation, or proximity to permanent or semipermanent water.

(iii) A consistent and diverse supply of prey. Although the specific prey species used by the Buena Vista Lake shrew have not been identified, ornate shrews are known to eat a variety of terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, including amphipods, slugs, and insects.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at *http://criticalhabitat.fws.gov/crithab/,* and at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2009-0062, and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of our regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(1) Critical habitat units for the Mariana crow are depicted for the Territory of Guam and the island of Rota, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements required by the Mariana crow for the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, roosting, nesting, and rearing of young are found in areas that support limestone, secondary, ravine, swamp, agricultural, and coastal forests composed of native and introduced plant species. These forest types provide the primary constituent elements of:

(i) Emergent trees and subcanopy trees with dense cover for breeding, such as *Neisosperma oppositifolia* (fagot), *Macaranga thompsonii* (pengua), *Intsia bijuga* (ifit), *Premna obtusifolia* (ahgao), *Eugenia reinwardtiana* (aabang), *Ficus* spp. (fig), *Elaeocarpus joga* (yoga), and *Tristiropsis obtusangula* (faniok);

(ii) Sufficient area of predominantly native forest to allow nesting at least 950 ft (290 m) from the nearest road and 203 ft (62 m) from the nearest forest edge and to support Mariana crow breeding territories (approximately 30 to 91 ac (12 to 37 ha)) and foraging areas for nonbreeding juvenile crows; and

(iii) Standing dead trees and plant species for foraging such as *Aglaia mariannensis* (maypunayo), *Artocarpus* spp. (breadfruit), *Cocos nucifera* (coconut palm), fagot, *Hibiscus tiliaceus* (pago), ifit, *Leucaena* spp. (tangantangan), *Ochrosia mariannensis* (langiti), *Pandanus tectorius* (kafu), ahgao, fig, and joga.

(3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and structures within the boundaries of the mapped units, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) Critical habitat units are described below. Coordinates are in UTM Zone 55 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83)/World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84).

1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Unit 1 (Central Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta), Unit 2 (South Y-K Delta Unit), Unit 3 (Norton Sound), Unit 4 (Ledyard Bay), and Unit 5 (the Wintering Unit in the Bering Sea between St. Lawrence and St. Matthew Islands) for reference only. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements are those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of feeding, nesting, brood rearing, roosting, molting, migrating and wintering. The primary constituent elements for Units 1 and 2 (the Y-K Delta units) include the vegetated intertidal zone and all open water inclusions within this zone. Primary constituent elements for the Norton Sound Unit (Unit 3) and the Ledyard Bay Unit (Unit 4) include all marine waters greater than 5 m (16.4 ft) in depth and less than or equal to 25 m (82.0 ft) in depth, along with associated marine aquatic flora and fauna in the water column, and the underlying marine benthic community. Primary constituent elements for the Wintering Unit (Unit 5) include all marine waters less than or equal to 75 m (246.1 ft) in depth, along with associated marine aquatic flora and fauna in the water column, and the underlying marine benthic community. Critical habitat does not include those areas within the boundary of any unit that do not fit the description of primary constituent elements for that unit.

3. Critical habitat does not include existing features and structures, such as buildings, roads, pipelines, utility corridors, airports, other paved areas, and other developed areas.

4. This final rule designating critical habitat for the spectacled eider uses published coordinates of prominent landmarks, when appropriate, obtained from the Dictionary of Alaska Place Names.

Oahu elepaio (*Chasiempis ibidis*)

(1) Critical Habitat Units are depicted for the City and County of Honolulu on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2)(i) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements required by the Oahu elepaio are those habitat components that are essential for the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, roosting, nesting, and rearing of young. These primary constituent elements are undeveloped wet, mesic, and dry forest habitats with a generally continuous canopy and a dense understory and that are composed of native and/or introduced plant species. Such forests are found in valleys and on mountain slopes and ridges. The primary constituent elements associated with the biological needs of dispersal and genetic exchange are undeveloped wet or dry shrub land and wet or dry cliff habitats composed of native and/or introduced plant species that separate elepaio populations. Elepaio may not establish territories in shrub or cliff habitats and may use them only transiently, but undeveloped areas containing these habitats are important for linking populations by providing dispersal corridors and promoting genetic exchange among populations.

(ii) Within the forests and shrub lands providing the primary constituent elements, plant species composition varies with rainfall, elevation, and degree of habitat disturbance, and plant species occur in a variety of assemblages. Common native and introduced species within these plant assemblages include, but are not limited to, ohia (*Metrosideros polymorpha*), koa (*Acacia koa*), papala kepau (*Pisonia umbellifera*), lama (*Diospyros sandwicensis*), mamaki (*Pipturus albidus*), kaulu (*Sapindus oahuensis*), hame (*Antidesma platyphyllum*), alaa (*Pouteria sandwicensis*), aalii (*Dodonaea viscosa*), naupaka kuahiwi (*Scaevola spp.*), pukiawe (*Styphelia tameiameiae*), uluhe (*Dicranopteris linearis*), guava (*Psidium guajava*), strawberry guava (*P. cattleianum*), mango (*Mangifera indica*), kukui (*Aleurites moluccana*), christmasberry (*Schinus terebinthifolius*), ti (*Cordyline terminalis*), rose apple (*Syzygium jambos*), mountain apple (*S. malaccense*), and Java plum (*S. cumini*).

(3) Existing developed features and structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, that do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements, are not included as critical habitat.

![](/graphics/er10de01.007.gif)Southwestern Willow Flycatcher (*Empidonax traillii extimus*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Inyo, Kern, Los Angeles, Riverside, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Ventura Counties in California; Clark, Lincoln, and Nye Counties in southern Nevada; Kane, San Juan, and Washington Counties in southern Utah; Alamosa, Conejos, Costilla, and La Plata Counties in southern Colorado; Apache, Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, La Paz, Maricopa, Mohave, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz, and Yavapai Counties in Arizona; and Catron, Grant, Hidalgo, Mora, Rio Arriba, Socorro, Taos, and Valencia Counties in New Mexico on the maps and as described below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the southwestern willow flycatcher consist of two components:

(i) *Riparian vegetation.* Riparian habitat along a dynamic river or lakeside, in a natural or manmade successional environment (for nesting, foraging, migration, dispersal, and shelter) that is comprised of trees and shrubs (that can include Gooddings willow, coyote willow, Geyer's willow, arroyo willow, red willow, yewleaf willow, pacific willow, boxelder, tamarisk, Russian olive, buttonbush, cottonwood, stinging nettle, alder, velvet ash, poison hemlock, blackberry, seep willow, oak, rose, sycamore, false indigo, Pacific poison ivy, grape, Virginia creeper, Siberian elm, and walnut) and some combination of:

(A) Dense riparian vegetation with thickets of trees and shrubs that can range in height from about 2 meters (m) to 30 m (about 6 feet (ft) to 98 ft). Lower-stature thickets (2 to 4 m or 6 to 13 ft tall) are found at higher elevation riparian forests, and tall-stature thickets are found at middle- and lower-elevation riparian forests;

(B) Areas of dense riparian foliage at least from the ground level up to approximately 4 m (13 ft) above ground or dense foliage only at the shrub or tree level as a low, dense canopy;

(C) Sites for nesting that contain a dense (about 50 percent to 100 percent) tree or shrub (or both) canopy (the amount of cover provided by tree and shrub branches measured from the ground);

(D) Dense patches of riparian forests that are interspersed with small openings of open water or marsh or areas with shorter and sparser vegetation that creates a variety of habitat that is not uniformly dense. Patch size may be as small as 0.1 hectare (ha) (0.25 acre (ac)) or as large as 70 ha (175 ac).

(ii) *Insect prey populations.* A variety of insect prey populations found within or adjacent to riparian floodplains or moist environments, which can include: flying ants, wasps, and bees (Hymenoptera); dragonflies (Odonata); flies (Diptera); true bugs (Hemiptera); beetles (Coleoptera); butterflies, moths, and caterpillars (Lepidoptera); and spittlebugs (Homoptera).

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on February 4, 2013.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created in two steps. First, the linear segments were mapped from the National Hydrologic Dataset using USA Contiguous Equidistant Conic (North American Datum 1983) coordinates. Next, the lateral extents were digitized over the most recent available aerial photography using Albers Equal Area Conic (North American Datum 1983) coordinates. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the field office internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/arizona/*), *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2011-0053, and at the Arizona Ecological Services Office. The textual description for each critical habitat unit below includes the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone and UTM easting (E) and northing (N) coordinate pairs for the starting and ending points.

![](/graphics/er03ja13.024.gif)Coastal California Gnatcatcher (*Polioptila californica californica*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Ventura Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements (PCEs) of critical habitat for coastal California gnatcatcher are:

(i) Dynamic and successional sage scrub habitats: Venturan coastal sage scrub, Diegan coastal sage scrub, Riversidean sage scrub, maritime succulent scrub, Riversidean alluvial fan scrub, southern coastal bluff scrub, and coastal sage-chaparral scrub in Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego Counties that provide space for individual and population growth, normal behavior, breeding, reproduction, nesting, dispersal and foraging; and

(ii) Non-sage scrub habitats such as chaparral, grassland, riparian areas, in proximity to sage scrub habitats as described for PCE 1 above that provide space for dispersal, foraging, and nesting.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the PCEs.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 1:24,0000 maps, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

(5) Note: Index map of critical habitat units for the coastal California gnatcatcher (Map 1) follows:

(1) The critical habitat unit for the Guam Micronesian kingfisher is depicted for the Territory of Guam on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements required by the Guam Micronesian kingfisher for the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, roosting, nesting, and rearing of young are found in areas that support limestone, secondary, ravine, swamp, agricultural, and coastal forests composed of native and introduced plant species. These forest types include the primary constituent elements of:

(i) Closed canopy and well-developed understory vegetation; large (approximately 43 cm (17 in) diameter at breast height), standing dead trees (especially *Tristiropsis obtusangula* (faniok), *Pisonia grandis* (umumu), *Artocarpus* spp. (breadfruit), *Ficus* spp. (fig), and *Cocos nucifera* (coconut palm)); mud nests of *Nasutitermes* spp. termites; and root masses of epiphytic ferns for breeding;

(ii) Sufficiently diverse structure to provide exposed perches and ground surfaces, leaf litter, and other substrates that support a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate prey species for foraging kingfishers; and

(iii) Sufficient overall breeding and foraging area to support kingfisher territories of approximately 25 ac (10 ha) each.

(3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and structures within the boundaries of the mapped units, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, antennas, water tanks, agricultural fields, paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) The critical habitat unit is described below. Coordinates are in UTM Zone 55 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) / World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84).

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Grays Harbor, Pacific, and Wahkiakum Counties in Washington, and Clatsop, Columbia, Marion, Polk, and Benton Counties in Oregon, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the streaked horned lark consist of areas having a minimum of 16 percent bare ground that have sparse, low-stature vegetation composed primarily of grasses and forbs less than 13 inches (33 centimeters) in height found in:

(i) Large (300-acre (120-hectare)), flat (0-5 percent slope) areas within a landscape context that provides visual access to open areas such as open water or fields; or

(ii) Areas smaller than described in paragraph (2)(i) of this entry, but that provide visual access to open areas such as open water or fields.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on November 4, 2013.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on 2010 aerial photography from U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agriculture Imagery Program base maps using ArcMap (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.), a computer geographic information system (GIS) program. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/wafwo*), at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R1-ES-2013-0009, and by appointment at the Service's Washington Fish and Wildlife Office.

(1) Critical habitat units for the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah are depicted on the maps below. Larger maps and digital files for all four States and maps of critical habitat units in the State of New Mexico are available at the New Mexico Ecological Services Field Office, 2105 Osuna N.E., Albuquerque, New Mexico 87113, telephone (505) 346-2525. For the States of Arizona, Colorado, and Utah, maps of the critical habitat units specific to each State are available at the following Service offices - Arizona Ecological Services Field Office, 2321 West Royal Palm Road, Suite 103, Phoenix, Arizona 85021, telephone (602) 640-2720; Colorado State Sub-Office, 764 Horizon Drive South, Annex A, Grand Junction, Colorado 81506, telephone (970) 243-2778; and Utah Ecological Services Field Office, Lincoln Plaza, 145 East 1300 South, Suite 404, Salt Lake City, Utah 84115, telephone (801) 524-5001.

(2) Critical habitat units are designated in portions of McKinley, Rio Arriba, Sandoval, and Socorro Counties in New Mexico; Apache, Cochise, Coconino, Graham, and Pima Counties in Arizona; Carbon, Emery, Garfield, Grand, Iron, Kane, Washington, and Wayne Counties in Utah; and Custer, Douglas, El Paso, Fremont, Huerfano, Jefferson, Pueblo, and Teller Counties in Colorado.

(3)(i) The primary constituent elements essential to the conservation of the owl include those physical and biological features that support nesting, roosting, and foraging. These elements were determined from studies of owl behavior and habitat use throughout the range of the owl. Although the vegetative communities and structural attributes used by the owl vary across the range of the subspecies, they consist primarily of mixed conifer forests or canyons. The mixed-conifer, pine-oak communities and canyon habitat appear to be the most frequently used community throughout most portions of the subspecies' range (Skaggs and Raitt 1988; Ganey and Balda 1989, 1994; Gutierrez and Rinkevich 1991, Service 1995). Although the structural characteristics of owl habitat vary depending on uses of the habitat (e.g., nesting, roosting, foraging) and variations in the plant communities over the range of the subspecies, some general attributes are common to the subspecies' life-history requirements throughout its range.

(ii) Protected and restricted habitat are two of the three types of owl habitat discussed in the Recovery Plan and are used as the basis for defining critical habitat. Protected areas include known owl sites (PACs), areas in mixed-conifer and pine-oak types with greater than 40 percent slopes where timber harvest has not occurred in the past 20 years and administratively reserved lands, such as Wilderness Areas or Research Natural Areas. Restricted habitat includes mixed-conifer forest, pine-oak forest, and riparian areas outside of protected areas. This final rule does not include all areas that meet the definition of protected and restricted habitat.

(iii) Canyon habitats used for nesting and roosting are typically characterized by cooler conditions found in steep, narrow canyons, often containing crevices, ledges, and/or caves. These canyons frequently contain small clumps or stringers of ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, white fir, and/or pinyon-juniper. Deciduous riparian and upland tree species may also be present. Adjacent uplands are usually vegetated by a variety of plant associations including pinyon-juniper woodland, desert scrub vegetation, ponderosa pine-Gamble oak, ponderosa pine, or mixed-conifer. Owl habitat may also exhibit a combination of attributes between the forested and canyon types.

(iv) The primary constituent elements for the Mexican spotted owl are:

(A) Primary constituent elements related to forest structure:

(*1*) A range of tree species, including mixed conifer, pine-oak, and riparian forest types, composed of different tree sizes reflecting different ages of trees, 30 percent to 45 percent of which are large trees with a trunk diameter of 12 inches (0.3 meters) or more when measured at 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) from the ground;

(*2*) A shade canopy created by the tree branches covering 40 percent or more of the ground; and

(*3*) Large dead trees (snags) with a trunk diameter of at least 12 inches (0.3 meters) when measured at 4.5 feet (1.4 meters) from the ground.

(B) Primary constituent elements related to maintenance of adequate prey species:

(*1*) High volumes of fallen trees and other woody debris;

(*2*) A wide range of tree and plant species, including hardwoods; and

(*3*) Adequate levels of residual plant cover to maintain fruits, seeds, and allow plant regeneration.

(C) Primary constituent elements related to canyon habitat include one or more of the following:

(*1*) Presence of water (often providing cooler and often higher humidity than the surrounding areas);

(*2*) Clumps or stringers of mixed-conifer, pine-oak, pinyon-juniper, and/or riparian vegetation;

(*3*) Canyon wall containing crevices, ledges, or caves; and

(4) Lands located within the mapped boundaries of the critical habitat designation that are not included in this designation, and are therefore excluded by definition, include: State and private lands, 157 wildland urban interface projects and the Penasco WUI project area that contain owls or habitat on Forest Service lands that are identified in the Wildland Urban Interface database located at *http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/wui/* and addressed in the April 10, 2001, final biological opinion on the Forest Service's proposed wildland urban interface fuel treatments in New Mexico and Arizona and the September 27, 2002, final biological opinion on the Rio Penasco II Non-Programmatic Vegetation Management Project and Forest Plan Amendment. The final biological opinions are available from the New Mexico Ecological Services Field Office, 2105 Osuna Road NE, Albuquerque, NM 87113.

(5) Critical habitat is defined as those areas within the mapped boundaries. Federal actions within the mapped boundaries would not trigger a section 7 consultation unless they may affect the owl or affect protected or restricted habitat, which includes canyon habitat, and one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(6) The minimum mapping unit for this designation does not exclude all developed areas, such as buildings, roads, bridges, parking lots, railroad tracks, other paved areas, the lands that support these features, and other lands unlikely to contain the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to these areas would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they affect protected or restricted habitat and one or more of the primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

![](/graphics/er31au04.029.gif)Northern Spotted Owl (*Strix occidentalis caurina*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the States of Washington, Oregon, and California on the maps below.

(2) Critical habitat for the northern spotted owl includes the following four primary constituent elements set forth in paragraph (2)(i) (primary constituent element 1) through paragraph (2)(iv) (primary constituent element 4) of this entry. Each critical habitat unit must include primary constituent element 1 and primary constituent element 2, 3, or 4:

(i) Primary constituent element 1: Forest types that may be in early-, mid-, or late-seral stages and that support the northern spotted owl across its geographical range. These forest types are primarily:

(A) Sitka spruce;

(B) Western hemlock;

(C) Mixed conifer and mixed evergreen;

(D) Grand fir;

(E) Pacific silver fir;

(F) Douglas-fir;

(G) White fir;

(H) Shasta red fir;

(I) Redwood/Douglas-fir (in coastal California and southwestern Oregon); and

(J) The moist end of the ponderosa pine coniferous forest zones at elevations up to approximately 3,000 ft (900 m) near the northern edge of the range and up to approximately 6,000 ft (1,800 m) at the southern edge.

(ii) Primary constituent element 2: Habitat that provides for nesting and roosting. In many cases the same habitat also provides for foraging (primary constituent element (3)). Nesting and roosting habitat provides structural features for nesting, protection from adverse weather conditions, and cover to reduce predation risks for adults and young. This primary constituent element is found throughout the geographical range of the northern spotted owl, because stand structures at nest sites tend to vary little across the northern spotted owl's range. These habitats must provide:

(A) Sufficient foraging habitat to meet the home range needs of territorial pairs of northern spotted owls throughout the year; and

(B) Stands for nesting and roosting that are generally characterized by:

(*1*) Moderate to high canopy cover (60 to over 80 percent).

(*2*) Multilayered, multispecies canopies with large (20-30 inches (in) (51-76 centimeters (cm)) or greater diameter at breast height (dbh)) overstory trees.

(*3*) High basal area (greater than 240 ft2/acre; 55 m2/ha).

(*4*) High diversity of different diameters of trees.

(*5*) High incidence of large live trees with various deformities (e.g., large cavities, broken tops, mistletoe infections, and other evidence of decadence).

(*6*) Large snags and large accumulations of fallen trees and other woody debris on the ground.

(*7*) Sufficient open space below the canopy for northern spotted owls to fly.

(iii) Primary constituent element 3: Habitat that provides for foraging, which varies widely across the northern spotted owl's range, in accordance with ecological conditions and disturbance regimes that influence vegetation structure and prey species distributions. Across most of the owl's range, nesting and roosting habitat is also foraging habitat, but in some regions northern spotted owls may additionally use other habitat types for foraging as well. The foraging habitat PCEs for the four ecological zones within the geographical range of the northern spotted owl are generally the following:

(A) *West Cascades/Coast Ranges of Oregon and Washington.*

(*1*) Stands of nesting and roosting habitat; additionally, owls may use younger forests with some structural characteristics (legacy features) of old forests, hardwood forest patches, and edges between old forest and hardwoods.

(*2*) Moderate to high canopy cover (60 to over 80 percent).

(*3*) A diversity of tree diameters and heights.

(*4*) Increasing density of trees greater than or equal to 31 in (80 cm) dbh increases foraging habitat quality (especially above 12 trees per ac (30 trees per ha)).

(*5*) Increasing density of trees 20 to 31 in (51 to 80 cm) dbh increases foraging habitat quality (especially above 24 trees per ac (60 trees per ha)).

(*6*) Increasing snag basal area, snag volume (the product of snag diameter, height, estimated top diameter, and including a taper function), and density of snags greater than 20 in (50 cm) dbh all contribute to increasing foraging habitat quality, especially above 10 snags/ha.

(*7*) Large accumulations of fallen trees and other woody debris on the ground.

(*8*) Sufficient open space below the canopy for northern spotted owls to fly.

(B) *East Cascades.*

(*1*) Stands of nesting and roosting habitat.

(*2*) Stands composed of Douglas-fir and white fir/Douglas-fir mix.

(*3*) Mean tree size (quadratic mean diameter greater than 16.5 in (42 cm)).

(*4*) Increasing density of large trees (greater than 26 in (66 cm)) and increasing basal area (the cross-sectional area of tree boles measured at breast height), which increases foraging habitat quality.

(*5*) Large accumulations of fallen trees and other woody debris on the ground.

(*6*) Sufficient open space below the canopy for northern spotted owls to fly.

(C) *Klamath and Northern California Interior Coast Ranges.*

(*1*) Stands of nesting and roosting habitat; in addition, other forest types with mature and old-forest characteristics.

(*2*) Presence of conifer species such as incense-cedar, sugar pine, and Douglas-fir and hardwood species such as bigleaf maple, black oak, live oaks, and madrone, as well as shrubs.

(*3*) Forest patches within riparian zones of low-order streams and edges between conifer and hardwood forest stands.

(*4*) Brushy openings and dense young stands or low-density forest patches within a mosaic of mature and older forest habitat.

(*5*) High canopy cover (87 percent at frequently used sites).

(*6*) Multiple canopy layers.

(*7*) Mean stand diameter greater than 21 in (52.5 cm).

(*8*) Increasing mean stand diameter and densities of trees greater than 26 in (66 cm) increases foraging habitat quality.

(*9*) Large accumulations of fallen trees and other woody debris on the ground.

(*10*) Sufficient open space below the canopy for northern spotted owls to fly.

(D) *Redwood Coast.*

(*1*) Nesting and roosting habitat; in addition, stands composed of hardwood tree species, particularly tanoak.

(*2*) Early-seral habitats 6 to 20 years old with dense shrub and hardwood cover and abundant woody debris; these habitats produce prey, and must occur in conjunction with nesting, roosting, or foraging habitat.

(*3*) Increasing density of small-to-medium sized trees (10 to 22 in; 25 to 56 cm), which increases foraging habitat quality.

(*4*) Trees greater than 26 in (66 cm) in diameter or greater than 41 years of age.

(*5*) Sufficient open space below the canopy for northern spotted owls to fly.

(iv) Primary constituent element 4: Habitat to support the transience and colonization phases of dispersal, which in all cases would optimally be composed of nesting, roosting, or foraging habitat (PCEs 2 or 3), but which may also be composed of other forest types that occur between larger blocks of nesting, roosting, and foraging habitat. In cases where nesting, roosting, or foraging habitats are insufficient to provide for dispersing or nonbreeding owls, the specific dispersal habitat PCEs for the northern spotted owl may be provided by the following:

(A) Habitat supporting the transience phase of dispersal, which includes:

(*1*) Stands with adequate tree size and canopy cover to provide protection from avian predators and minimal foraging opportunities; in general this may include, but is not limited to, trees with at least 11 in (28 cm) dbh and a minimum 40 percent canopy cover; and

(*2*) Younger and less diverse forest stands than foraging habitat, such as even-aged, pole-sized stands, if such stands contain some roosting structures and foraging habitat to allow for temporary resting and feeding during the transience phase.

(B) Habitat supporting the colonization phase of dispersal, which is generally equivalent to nesting, roosting and foraging habitat as described in PCEs 2 and 3, but may be smaller in area than that needed to support nesting pairs.

(3) Critical habitat does not include:

(i) manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, other paved areas, or surface mine sites) and the land on which they are located; and

(ii) meadows, grasslands, oak woodlands, or aspen woodlands as described below existing on January 3, 2013 and not containing primary constituent elements 1 and 2, 3, or 4 as described in paragraph (2) of this entry.

(A) Meadows and grasslands include: dry, upland prairies and savannas in valleys and foothills of western Washington, Oregon, and northwest California; subalpine meadows; and grass and forb dominated cliffs, bluffs and grass balds found throughout these same areas. These areas are dominated by native grasses and diverse forbs, and may include a minor savanna component of Oregon white oak, Douglas-fir, or Ponderosa pine.

(B) Oak woodlands are characterized by an open canopy dominated by Oregon white oak. These areas may also include ponderosa pine, California black oak, Douglas-fir, or canyon live oak. The understory is relatively open with shrubs, grasses and wildflowers. Oak woodlands are typically found in drier landscapes and on south-facing slopes. This exception for oak woodlands does not include tanoak (*Notholithocarpus densiflorus*) stands, closed-canopy live oak (*Quercus agrifolia*) woodlands and open-canopied valley oak (*Quercus lobata*) and mixed-oak woodlands in subunits ICC-6 and RDC-5 in Napa, Sonoma, and Marin Counties, California.

(C) Aspen (*Populus* spp.) woodlands are dominated by aspen trees with a forb, grass or shrub understory and are typically found on mountain slopes, rock outcrops and talus slopes, canyon walls, and some seeps and stream corridors. This forest type also can occur in riparian areas or in moist microsites within drier landscapes.

(4) We have determined that the physical and biological features in habitat occupied by the species at the time it was listed, as represented by the primary constituent elements, may require special management considerations or protection as required by 16 U.S.C. 1532(5)(A). However, nothing in this rule requires land managers to implement, or precludes land managers from implementing, special management or protection measures.

(5) *Critical habitat map units.* The designated critical habitat units for the northern spotted owl are depicted on the maps below. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available at the field office Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/oregonfwo*), *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R1-ES-2011-0112, and at the Service's Oregon Fish and Wildlife Office.

![](/graphics/er30mr16.064.gif)Piping Plover (*Charadrius melodus*) - Great Lakes Breeding Population

1. Critical habitat units are depicted for St. Louis County, Minnesota; Douglas, Ashland, Marinette, and Manitowoc Counties, Wisconsin; Lake County, Illinois; Porter County, Indiana; Erie and Lake Counties, Ohio; Erie County, Pennsylvania; Oswego and Jefferson Counties, New York; and Alger, Schoolcraft, Luce, Mackinac, Chippewa, Iosco, Presque Isle, Cheboygan, Emmet, Charlevoix, Leelanau, Benzie, Mason, and Muskegon Counties, Michigan, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

2. i. The primary constituent elements required to sustain the Great Lakes breeding population of the piping plover are found on Great Lakes islands and mainland shorelines that support open, sparsely vegetated sandy habitats, such as sand spits or sand beaches, that are associated with wide, unforested systems of dunes and inter-dune wetlands. In order for habitat to be physically and biologically suitable for piping plovers, it must have a total shoreline length of at least 0.2 km (0.12 mi) of gently sloping, sparsely vegetated (less than 50 percent herbaceous and low woody cover) sand beach with a total beach area of at least 2 hectares (ha) (5 acres (ac)) and a low level of disturbance from human activities and from domestic animals. As the nesting season progresses, the level of disturbance tolerated by piping plovers increases. A lower level of disturbance is required at the beginning of the nesting period during nest site selection, egg laying, and incubation. Beach activities that may be associated with a high level of disturbance include, but are not limited to, walking pets off leash, loud noise, driving ATVs, or significantly increased human presence. The level of disturbance is relative to the proximity to the nest, intensity, and frequency of these and other similar activities.

ii. Appropriately sized sites must also have areas of at least 50 meters (m) (164 feet (ft)) in length where the beach width is more than 7 m (23 ft), there is protective cover for nests and chicks, and the distance to the treeline (from the normal high water line to where the forest begins) is more than 50 m (164 ft). Beach width is defined as the distance from the normal high water line to the foredune (a low barrier dune ridge immediately inland from the beach) edge, or to the sand/vegetation boundary in areas where the foredune is absent. The beach width may be narrower than 7 m (23 ft) if appropriate sand and cobble areas of at least 7 m (23 ft) exist between the dune and the treeline. Protective cover for nests and chicks consists of small patches of herbaceous vegetation, cobble (stones larger than 1 cm (0.4 inches (in)) diameter), gravel (stones smaller than 1 cm (0.4 in) diameter), or debris such as driftwood, wrack, root masses, or dead shrubs.

iii. The dynamic ecological processes that create and maintain piping plover habitat are also important primary constituent elements. These geologically dynamic lakeside regions are controlled by processes of erosion, accretion, plant succession, and lake-level fluctuations. The integrity of the habitat components depends upon regular sediment transport processes, as well as episodic, high-magnitude storm events. By their nature, Great Lakes shorelines are in a constant state of change; habitat features may disappear, or be created nearby. The critical habitat boundaries reflect these natural processes and the dynamic character of Great Lakes shorelines.

3. Critical habitat does not include existing features and structures, such as buildings, marinas, paved areas, boat ramps, piers, bridges, lighthouses, and similar structures not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

![](/graphics/er07my01.008.gif)Piping Plover (*Charadrius melodus*) Wintering Habitat

1. The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the wintering population of the piping plover are the habitat components that support foraging, roosting, and sheltering and the physical features necessary for maintaining the natural processes that support these habitat components. The primary constituent elements are:

(1) Intertidal sand beaches (including sand flats) or mud flats (between the mean lower low water line and annual high tide) with no or very sparse emergent vegetation for feeding. In some cases, these flats may be covered or partially covered by a mat of blue-green algae.

(2) Unvegetated or sparsely vegetated sand, mud, or algal flats above annual high tide for roosting. Such sites may have debris or detritus and may have micro-topographic relief (less than 20 in (50 cm) above substrate surface) offering refuge from high winds and cold weather.

(3) Surf-cast algae for feeding.

(4) Sparsely vegetated backbeach, which is the beach area above mean high tide seaward of the dune line, or in cases where no dunes exist, seaward of a delineating feature such as a vegetation line, structure, or road. Backbeach is used by plovers for roosting and refuge during storms.

(5) Spits, especially sand, running into water for foraging and roosting.

(6) Salterns, or bare sand flats in the center of mangrove ecosystems that are found above mean high water and are only irregularly flushed with sea water.

(7) Unvegetated washover areas with little or no topographic relief for feeding and roosting. Washover areas are formed and maintained by the action of hurricanes, storm surges, or other extreme wave actions.

(8) Natural conditions of sparse vegetation and little or no topographic relief mimicked in artificial habitat types (e.g., dredge spoil sites).

2. Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

3. Below, we describe each unit in terms of its location, size, and ownership. These textual unit descriptions are the definitive source for determining the critical habitat boundaries. The maps provided are for informational purposes only. All distances and areas provided here are approximated.

Data layers defining map units 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 22, 23, 27, 28, 31, 32, and 33 were created using 1992 National Wetlands Inventory data (except for Unit TX-22, which had 2001 data available) and/or digitized using 2005 National Agriculture Imagery Program data and NOAA mean lower low water vector data).

Unit TX-1: South Bay and Boca Chica. 2,920 ha (7,217 ac) in Cameron County

The boundaries of the unit are: starting at the Loma Ochoa, following the Brownsville Ship Channel to the northeast out into the Gulf of Mexico to MLLW, then south along a line describing MLLW to the mouth of the Rio Grande, proceeding up the Rio Grande to Loma de Las Vacas, then from that point along a straight line north to Loma Ochoa. The unit does not include densely vegetated habitat within those boundaries. It includes wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds, and includes the tidal flats area known as South Bay. Beaches within the unit reach from the mouth of the Rio Grande northward to Brazos Santiago Pass, south of South Padre Island. The southern and western boundaries follow the change in habitat from wind tidal flat, preferred by the piping plover, to where densely vegetated habitat, not used by the piping plover, begins and where the constituent elements no longer occur. The upland areas extend to where densely vegetated habitat, not used by the piping plover, begins and where the constituent elements no longer occur and include areas used for roosting by the piping plover. Portions of this unit are owned and managed by the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge, the South Bay Coastal Preserve, Boca Chica State Park, and private citizens.

Unit TX-2: Queen Isabella Causeway. 2 ha (6 ac) in Cameron County

The area extends along the Laguna Madre west of the city of South Padre Island.

The Queen Isabella causeway bisects this shore but is not included within critical habitat. The eastern boundary is where developed areas and/or dense vegetation begins, and the western boundary is MLLW. This unit contains lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-5: Upper Laguna Madre. 436 ha (1,076 ac) in Kleberg County

The southern boundary is the northern boundary of PAIS, and the northern boundary is the Kleberg/Nueces County line. The eastern boundary is the line where dense vegetation begins, and the western boundary is MLLW. This unit includes a series of small flats along the bayside of Padre Island in the Upper Laguna Madre. It includes wind tidal flats and sparsely-vegtated upland areas used for roosting by the piping plover. These boundaries receive heavy use by large numbers of shorebirds, including piping plovers. The upland areas extend to where densely vegetated habitat, not used by the piping plover, begins and where the constituent elements no longer occur, and include upland areas used for roosting by the piping plover.

Unit TX-6: Mollie Beattie Coastal Habitat. 241 ha (596 ac) in Nueces County

This unit will be described as two subunits:

(1) Subunit is bounded on the north by Beach Access Road 3, on the east by the inland boundary of critical habitat Unit TX-7, on the south by Zahn road, and on the west by Zahn Road.

(2) The subunit is bounded on the north by Corpus Christi Pass, on the east by US 361, on the south by the north side of Packery Channel, and on the west by the Gulf Intercoastal Watersay.

Some of the uplands are privately owned and the remaining are owned and managed by the TGLO. This unit includes two hurricane washover passes known as Newport and Corpus Christi Passes, and wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds. The upland areas extend to where densely vegetated habitat, not used by the piping plover, begins and where the constituent elements no longer occur and include upland areas used for roosting by the piping plover.

Unit TX-11: Blind Oso. 2 ha (5 ac) in Nueces County

This unit is the flats of the Blind Oso, part of Oso Bay, from Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge (owned and managed by the City of Corpus Christi) northeast to Corpus Christi Bay and then southeast along the edge of Texas A&M University - Corpus Christi. The landward boundaries extend to where densely vegetated habitat, not used by the piping plover, begins, and extends out from the landward boundaries to MLLW. This unit includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-12: Adjacent to Naval Air Station-Corpus Christi. 2 ha (6 ac) in Nueces County

This unit is along the shore of Oso Bay on flats bordered by Naval Air Station-Corpus Christi and Texas Spur 3 to a point 2.5 km (1.5 mi) south of the bridge between Ward Island and the Naval Air Station. The landward boundary is the line where dense vegetation begins, and the boundary in the Bay is MLLW. This unit includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-13: Sunset Lake. 176 ha (435 ac) in San Patricio County

This unit is triangle shaped, with State Highway 181 as the northwest boundary, and the limits of the City of Portland as the northeast boundary. The shore on Corpus Christi Bay is the third side of the triangle, with the actual boundary being MLLW off this shore. This unit is a large basin with a series of tidal ponds, sand spits and wind tidal flats. This unit is owned and managed by the City of Portland within a system of city parks. Some of the described area falls within the jurisdiction of the TGLO. It includes two city park units referred to as Indian Point and Sunset Lake. Much of the unit is a recent acquisition by the city, and management considerations for the park include the area's importance as a site for wintering and resident shorebirds. This unit includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-29: Brown Cedar Cut. 119 ha (294 ac) in Matagorda County

This unit extends 2 km (1.2 mi.) both southwest and northeast of the main channel of Brown Cedar Cut along the bayside of Matagorda Peninsula in East Matagorda Bay, and abuts unit TX-28 to the southeast. The landward boundary is the line indicating the beginning of dense vegetation, and the bayside boundary is MLLW. The eastern boundary of TX-29 follows the change in habitat from mud flats preferred by the piping plover, to slightly vegetated dune system adjacent to TX-28. This unit includes upland areas used for roosting by the piping plover. This unit includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-30: Northeast Corner East Matagorda Bay. 120 ha (297 ac) in Matagorda County

This unit is bounded on the north by the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway, on the east by the northeast limit of Matagorda bay up the line where dense vegetation begins, on the south by the boundary of Unit TX-28, and on the west by MLLW. It is a system of flats associated with tidal channels. This unit includes upland areas used for roosting by the piping plover and lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-34: San Luis Pass. 110 ha (272 ac) near the Brazoria/Galveston County line

This unit extends along the Gulf side of Galveston Island from San Luis Pass to the site of the former town of Red Fish Cove (USGS 1:24,000 map, San Luis Pass, Texas; 1963, photorevision 1974). The landward boundary is the line indicating the beginning of dense vegetation, and the gulfside boundary is MLLW. Approximately 57 percent of the unit includes flats in the floodtide delta that are State-owned and managed by the TGLO. This unit includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-35: Big Reef. 47 ha (117 ac) in Galveston County

This unit consists of beach and sand flats on the north, west, and east shore of Big Reef, down to MLLW. South Jetty is not included. The area is currently managed by the City of Galveston. This unit includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-36: Bolivar Flats. 160 ha (395 ac) in Galveston County

This unit extends from the jetties on the southwest end of the Bolivar Peninsula to a point on the Gulf beach 1 km (0.6 mi) north of Beacon Bayou. It includes 5.0 km (3 mi) of Gulf shoreline. The landward boundary is the line indicating the beginning of dense vegetation, and the gulfside boundary is MLLW. The area is leased from TGLO by Houston Audubon Society and managed for its important avian resources. The upland areas are used for roosting by the piping plover. This unit includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

Unit TX-37: Rollover Pass. 6 ha (16 ac) in Galveston County

This unit consists of Rollover Bay on the bayside of Bolivar Peninsula. The landward boundary is the line indicating the beginning of dense vegetation, and the bayside boundary is MLLW. It includes flats on State-owned land managed by the TGLO. This unit captures the intertidal complex of the bay, and is bounded by the towns of Gilchrist to the east and the Gulf beach of the Bolivar Peninsula to the south. This unit includes lands known as wind tidal flats that are infrequently inundated by seasonal winds.

1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota, on the maps and as described below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

2. The one overriding primary constituent element (biological) required to sustain the northern Great Plains breeding population of piping plovers that must be present at all sites is the dynamic ecological processes that create and maintain piping plover habitat. Without this biological process the physical component of the primary constituent elements would not be able to develop. These processes develop a mosaic of habitats on the landscape that provide the essential combination of prey, forage, nesting, brooding and chick-rearing areas. The annual, seasonal, daily, and even hourly availability of the habitat patches is dependent on local weather, hydrological conditions and cycles, and geological processes. The biological primary constituent element, *i.e.,* dynamic ecological processes, creates different physical primary constituent elements on the landscape. These physical primary constituent elements exist on different habitat types found in the northern Great Plains, including mixosaline to hypersaline wetlands (Cowardin *et al.* 1979), rivers, reservoirs, and inland lakes. These habitat types or physical primary constituent elements that sustain the northern Great Plains breeding population of piping plovers are described as follows:

i. On prairie alkali lakes and wetlands, the physical primary constituent elements include - (1) shallow, seasonally to permanently flooded, mixosaline to hypersaline wetlands with sandy to gravelly, sparsely vegetated beaches, salt-encrusted mud flats, and/or gravelly salt flats; (2) springs and fens along edges of alkali lakes and wetlands; and (3) adjacent uplands 200 ft (61 m) above the high water mark of the alkali lake or wetland.

ii. On rivers the physical primary constituent elements include - sparsely vegetated channel sandbars, sand and gravel beaches on islands, temporary pools on sandbars and islands, and the interface with the river.

iii. On reservoirs the physical primary constituent elements include - sparsely vegetated shoreline beaches, peninsulas, islands composed of sand, gravel, or shale, and their interface with the water bodies.

iv. On inland lakes (Lake of the Woods) the physical primary constituent elements include - sparsely vegetated and windswept sandy to gravelly islands, beaches, and peninsulas, and their interface with the water body.

3.

![](/graphics/er11se02.018.gif)Western Snowy Plover (*Charadrius nivosus nivosus*) - Pacific Coast Population

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for: Washington - Grays Harbor and Pacific Counties; Oregon - Clatsop, Tillamook, Lane, Douglas, Coos, and Curry Counties; and California - Del Norte, Humboldt, Mendocino, Marin, Napa, Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Cruz, Monterey, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Pacific Coast population of the western snowy plover are sandy beaches, dune systems immediately inland of an active beach face, salt flats, mud flats, seasonally exposed gravel bars, artificial salt ponds and adjoining levees, and dredge spoil sites, with:

(i) Areas that are below heavily vegetated areas or developed areas and above the daily high tides;

(ii) Shoreline habitat areas for feeding, with no or very sparse vegetation, that are between the annual low tide or low-water flow and annual high tide or high-water flow, subject to inundation but not constantly under water, that support small invertebrates, such as crabs, worms, flies, beetles, spiders, sand hoppers, clams, and ostracods, that are essential food sources;

(iii) Surf- or water-deposited organic debris, such as seaweed (including kelp and eelgrass) or driftwood located on open substrates that supports and attracts small invertebrates described in paragraph (ii) of this entry for food, and provides cover or shelter from predators and weather, and assists in avoidance of detection (crypsis) for nests, chicks, and incubating adults; and

(iv) Minimal disturbance from the presence of humans, pets, vehicles, or human-attracted predators which provide relatively undisturbed areas for individual and population growth and for normal behavior.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, roads, paved areas, boat ramps, and other developed areas) and the land on which such structures are directly located and existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS digital ortho-photo quarter-quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10N and 11N coordinates.

(5) The coordinates for these maps are available on the Internet at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2010-0070, at *http://www.fws.gov/arcata/,* or at the Arcata Fish and Wildlife Office, 1655 Heindon Road, Arcata, CA 95521.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Grand and San Juan Counties, Utah, and Delta, Dolores, Gunnison, Hinsdale, Mesa, Montrose, Ouray, Saguache, and San Miguel Counties, Colorado, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements (PCEs) of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of Gunnison sage-grouse consist of five components:

(i) *Landscape Specific Primary Constituent Element.* Primary Constituent Element 1 - Extensive sagebrush landscapes capable of supporting a population of Gunnison sage-grouse. In general, this includes areas with vegetation composed primarily of sagebrush plant communities (at least 25 percent of the land is dominated by sagebrush cover within a 0.9-mi (1.5-km) radius of any given location), of sufficient size and configuration to encompass all seasonal habitats for a given population of Gunnison sage-grouse, and facilitate movements within and among populations. These areas also occur wholly within the potential historical range of Gunnison sage-grouse.

(ii) *Seasonally Specific Primary Constituent Elements.* (A) Primary Constituent Element 2 - Breeding habitat composed of sagebrush plant communities that, in general, have the structural characteristics within the ranges described in the following table. Habitat structure values are average values over a project area. Breeding habitat includes lek, nesting, and early brood-rearing habitats used typically March 15 through July 15. Early brood-rearing habitat may include agricultural fields.

|  Vegetation variable  |Amount in  <br/>habitat|
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
|   Sagebrush Canopy    |    10-25 percent.     |
|Non-sagebrush Canopy \*|     5-15 percent.     |
|  Total Shrub Canopy   |    15-40 percent.     |
|   Sagebrush Height    |9.8-19.7 in (25-50 cm).|
|      Grass Cover      |    10-40 percent.     |
|      Forb Cover       |     5-40 percent.     |
|     Grass Height      |3.9-5.9 in (10-15 cm). |

![](/graphics/ec01jn91.078.gif)Loggerhead Sea Turtle, Northwest Atlantic Ocean DPS (*Caretta caretta*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the following areas on the maps below:

(i) North Carolina - Brunswick, Carteret, New Hanover, Onslow, and Pender Counties;

(ii) South Carolina - Beaufort, Charleston, Colleton, and Georgetown Counties;

(iii) Georgia - Camden, Chatham, Liberty, and McIntosh Counties;

(iv) Florida - Bay, Brevard, Broward, Charlotte, Collier, Duval, Escambia, Flagler, Franklin, Gulf, Indian River, Lee, Manatee, Martin, Monroe, Palm Beach, Sarasota, St. Johns, St. Lucie, and Volusia Counties;

(v) Alabama - Baldwin County; and

(vi) Mississippi - Jackson County.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Northwest Atlantic Ocean distinct population segment of the loggerhead sea turtle are the extra-tidal or dry sandy beaches from the mean high-water line to the toe of the secondary dune, which are capable of supporting a high density of nests or serving as an expansion area for beaches with a high density of nests and that are well distributed within each State, or region within a State, and representative of total nesting, consisting of four components:

(i) Suitable nesting beach habitat that:

(A) Has relatively unimpeded nearshore access from the ocean to the beach for nesting females and from the beach to the ocean for both post-nesting females and hatchlings; and

(B) Is located above mean high water to avoid being inundated frequently by high tides.

(ii) Sand that:

(A) Allows for suitable nest construction;

(B) Is suitable for facilitating gas diffusion conducive to embryo development; and

(C) Is able to develop and maintain temperatures and a moisture content conducive to embryo development.

(iii) Suitable nesting beach habitat with sufficient darkness to ensure that nesting turtles are not deterred from emerging onto the beach and hatchlings and post-nesting females orient to the sea.

(iv) Natural coastal processes or artificially created or maintained habitat mimicking natural conditions. This includes artificial habitat types that mimic the natural conditions described in paragraphs (2)(i), (2)(ii), and (2)(iii) of this entry for beach access, nest site selection, nest construction, egg deposition and incubation, and hatchling emergence and movement to the sea. Habitat modification and loss occurs with beach stabilization activities that prevent the natural transfer and erosion and accretion of sediments along the ocean shoreline. Beach stabilization efforts that may impact loggerhead nesting include beach nourishment, beach maintenance, sediment dredging and disposal, inlet channelization, and construction of jetties and other hard structures. However, when sand placement activities result in beach habitat that mimics the natural beach habitat conditions, impacts to sea turtle nesting habitat are minimized.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on August 11, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using Google Earth imagery, then refined using Bing imagery. Unit descriptions were then mapped using North America Lambert Conformal Conic coordinates. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site at *http://www.fws.gov/northflorida,* at *http:www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2012-0103, and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the USFWS regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Alameda, Contra Costa, San Joaquin, and Santa Clara counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements (PCEs) of critical habitat for the Alameda whipsnake (*Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus*) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) *Scrub/shrub communities with a mosaic of open and closed canopy:* Scrub/shrub vegetation dominated by low- to medium-stature woody shrubs with a mosaic of open and closed canopy, as characterized by the chamise, chamise-eastwood manzanita, chaparral whitethorn, and interior live oak shrub vegetation series occurring at elevations from sea level to approximately 3,850 feet (1,170 meters). Such scrub/shrub vegetation within these series form a pattern of open and closed canopy used by the Alameda whipsnake for shelter from predators; temperature regulation, because it provides sunny and shady locations; prey-viewing opportunities; and nesting habitat and substrate. These features contribute to support a prey base consisting of western fence lizards and other prey species such as skinks, frogs, snakes, and birds.

(ii) *Woodland or annual grassland plant communities contiguous to lands containing PCE 1:* Woodland or annual grassland vegetation series comprised of one or more of the following: Blue oak, coast live oak, California bay, California buckeye, and California annual grassland vegetation series. This mosaic of vegetation supports a prey base consisting of western fence lizards and other prey species such as skinks, frogs, snakes, and birds, and provides opportunities for: Foraging, by allowing snakes to come in contact with and visualize, track, and capture prey (especially western fence lizards, along with other prey such as skinks, frogs, birds); short and long distance dispersal within, between, or adjacent to areas containing essential features (*i.e.*, PCE 1 or PCE 3); and contact with other Alameda whipsnakes for mating and reproduction.

(iii) *Lands containing rock outcrops, talus, and small mammal burrows.* These areas are used for retreats (shelter), hibernacula, foraging, and dispersal, and provide additional prey population support functions.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.

Critical Habitat Unit Maps

(4) GIS data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat unit is depicted for Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, on the map below.

(2) Within this area, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of coquí llanero consist of three components:

(i) *Palustrine herbaceous wetland.* Palustrine emergent persistent wetlands that are seasonally to permanently flooded. Ocean-derived salts need to be less than 0.5 parts per thousand (ppt) salinity.

(ii) *Vegetation and vegetation composition of the palustrine herbaceous wetland.* Emergent vegetation characterized by erect, rooted herbaceous hydrophytes usually dominated by perennial plants like ferns, *Sagittaria lancifolia,* flatsedges, spike rushes, vines, and grasses. In addition to the combination of vegetation, at least 25 percent of the vegetation should be ferns and *S. lancifolia.*

(iii) *Hydrology.* A hydrologic flow regime (*i.e.*, the pathways of precipitation, surface run-off, groundwater, tides, and flooding of rivers and canals [manmade ditches]) that maintains the palustrine herbaceous wetland.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on November 5, 2012.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created by delineating habitats that contain at least one or more of the primary constituent elements defined in paragraph (2) of this entry, over a base of USGS digital topographic map quadrangle (Bayamón) and a USDA 2007 digital ortho-photo mosaic, in addition to the National Wetland Inventory maps. The resulting critical habitat unit was then mapped using State Plane North American Datum (NAD) 83 coordinates. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site, (*http://www.fws.gov/caribbean/es/Endangered-Main.html*), (*http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2009-0022 and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(5) Sabana Seca Unit, Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.

(i) *General Description:* The Sabana Seca Unit consists of approximately 615 ac (249 ha) located south of State Road PR-867, west-southwest of Ramón Ríos Román Avenue, east of José Julián Acosta Road, and north of the limestone hills located north of Highway PR-22 in the municipality of Toa Baja, Puerto Rico.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Alameda, Butte, Calaveras, Contra Costa, El Dorado, Kern, Kings, Los Angeles, Marin, Mendocino, Merced, Monterey, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Riverside, San Benito, San Joaquin, San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Solano, Sonoma, Stanislaus, Ventura, and Yuba Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the California red-legged frog consist of four components:

(i) *Aquatic Breeding Habitat.* Standing bodies of fresh water (with salinities less than 4.5 ppt), including natural and manmade (e.g., stock) ponds, slow-moving streams or pools within streams, and other ephemeral or permanent water bodies that typically become inundated during winter rains and hold water for a minimum of 20 weeks in all but the driest of years.

(ii) *Aquatic Non-Breeding Habitat.* Freshwater pond and stream habitats, as described in paragraph (2)(i) of this entry, that may not hold water long enough for the species to complete its aquatic life cycle but which provide for shelter, foraging, predator avoidance, and aquatic dispersal of juvenile and adult California red-legged frogs. Other wetland habitats considered to meet these criteria include, but are not limited to: plunge pools within intermittent creeks, seeps, quiet water refugia within streams during high water flows, and springs of sufficient flow to withstand short-term dry periods.

(iii) *Upland Habitat.* Upland areas adjacent to or surrounding breeding and non-breeding aquatic and riparian habitat up to a distance of 1 mi (1.6 km) in most cases (*i.e.*, depending on surrounding landscape and dispersal barriers) including various vegetational series such as grassland, woodland, forest, wetland, or riparian areas that provide shelter, forage, and predator avoidance for the California red-legged frog. Upland habitat should include structural features such as boulders, rocks and organic debris (e.g., downed trees, logs), small mammal burrows, or moist leaf litter. Upland features are also essential in that they are needed to maintain the hydrologic, geographic, topographic, ecological, and edaphic features that support and surround the aquatic, wetland, or riparian habitat. These upland features contribute to:

(A) Filling of aquatic, wetland, or riparian habitats;

(B) Maintaining suitable periods of pool inundation for larval frogs and their food sources; and

(C) Providing non-breeding, feeding, and sheltering habitat for juvenile and adult frogs (e.g., shelter, shade, moisture, cooler temperatures, a prey base, foraging opportunities, and areas for predator avoidance).

(iv) *Dispersal Habitat.* Accessible upland or riparian habitat within and between occupied locations within a minimum of 1 mi (1.6 km) of each other and that support movement between such sites. Dispersal habitat includes various natural habitats, and altered habitats such as agricultural fields, that do not contain barriers (e.g., heavily traveled roads without bridges or culverts) to dispersal. Dispersal habitat does not include moderate- to high-density urban or industrial developments with large expanses of asphalt or concrete, nor does it include large lakes or reservoirs over 50 ac (20 ha) in size, or other areas that do not contain those features identified in paragraphs (2)(i), (2)(ii), and (2)(iii) of this entry as essential to the conservation of the species.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles using USDA National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) county-wide MrSID compressed mosaics of 1 meter resolution and natural color aerial photography from summer 2005. Critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 10 and zone 11, North American Datum (NAD) 1983 coordinates.

![](/graphics/er17mr10.027.gif)Chiricahua Leopard Frog (*Lithobates chiricahuensis*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Apache, Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Pima, Santa Cruz, and Yavapai Counties, Arizona; and Catron, Grant, Hidalgo, Sierra, and Socorro Counties, New Mexico, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Chiricahua leopard frog are:

(i) Aquatic breeding habitat and immediately adjacent uplands exhibiting the following characteristics:

(A) Standing bodies of fresh water (with salinities less than 5 parts per thousand, pH greater than or equal to 5.6, and pollutants absent or minimally present), including natural and manmade (e.g., stock) ponds, slow-moving streams or pools within streams, off-channel pools, and other ephemeral or permanent water bodies that typically hold water or rarely dry for more than a month. During periods of drought, or less than average rainfall, these breeding sites may not hold water long enough for individuals to complete metamorphosis, but they would still be considered essential breeding habitat in non-drought years.

(B) Emergent and or submerged vegetation, root masses, undercut banks, fractured rock substrates, or some combination thereof, but emergent vegetation does not completely cover the surface of water bodies.

(C) Nonnative predators (e.g., crayfish (*Orconectes virilis*), bullfrogs (*Lithobates catesbeianus*), nonnative predatory fish) absent or occurring at levels that do not preclude presence of the Chiricahua leopard frog.

(D) Absence of chytridiomycosis, or if present, then environmental, physiological, and genetic conditions are such that allow persistence of Chiricahua leopard frogs.

(E) Upland habitats that provide opportunities for foraging and basking that are immediately adjacent to or surrounding breeding aquatic and riparian habitat.

(ii) Dispersal and nonbreeding habitat, consisting of areas with ephemeral (present for only a short time), intermittent, or perennial water that are generally not suitable for breeding, and associated upland or riparian habitat that provides corridors (overland movement or along wetted drainages) for frogs among breeding sites in a metapopulation with the following characteristics:

(A) Are not more than 1.0 mile (1.6 kilometers) overland, 3.0 miles (4.8 kilometers) along ephemeral or intermittent drainages, 5.0 miles (8.0 kilometers) along perennial drainages, or some combination thereof not to exceed 5.0 miles (8.0 kilometers).

(B) In overland and nonwetted corridors, provide some vegetation cover or structural features (e.g., boulders, rocks, organic debris such as downed trees or logs, small mammal burrows, or leaf litter) for shelter, forage, and protection from predators; in wetted corridors, provide some ephemeral, intermittent, or perennial aquatic habitat.

(C) Are free of barriers that block movement by Chiricahua leopard frogs, including, but not limited to, urban, industrial, or agricultural development; reservoirs that are 50 acres (20 hectares) or more in size and contain predatory nonnative fish, bullfrogs, or crayfish; highways that do not include frog fencing and culverts; and walls, major dams, or other structures that physically block movement.

(3) With the exception of impoundments, livestock tanks and other constructed waters, critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5' quadrangles, the Service's online Lands Mapper, the U.S. Geological Survey National Hydrography Dataset, and imagery from Google Earth. Lentic water bodies were digitized from Google Earth imagery. Point locations for lentic water bodies (still or non-flowing water bodies) were calculated as the geographic centroids of the digitized polygons defining the critical habitat boundaries. Line locations for lotic streams (flowing water) and drainages are depicted as the “Flowline” feature class from the National Hydrography Dataset geodatabase. Overland connections were digitized from Google Earth imagery. Administrative boundaries for Arizona and New Mexico were obtained from the Arizona Land Resource Information Service and New Mexico Resource Geographic Information System, respectively. This includes the most current (as of the effective date of this rule) geospatial data available for land ownership, counties, States, and streets. Locations depicting critical habitat are expressed as decimal degree latitude and longitude in the World Geographic Coordinate System projection using the 1984 datum (WGS84). Information on Chiricahua leopard frog localities was derived from survey forms, reports, publications, field notes, and other sources, all of which reside in our files at the Arizona Ecological Services Field Office, 2321 West Royal Palm Road, Suite 103, Phoenix, AZ 85021. Coordinates given for tanks are the approximate center points of those tanks.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, and Forrest, Harrison, Jackson, and Perry Counties in Mississippi, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the dusky gopher frog are:

(i) *Ephemeral wetland habitat.* Breeding ponds, geographically isolated from other waterbodies and embedded in forests historically dominated by longleaf pine communities, that are small (generally \<0.4 to 4.0 hectares (\<1 to 10 acres)), ephemeral, and acidic. Specific conditions necessary in breeding ponds to allow for successful reproduction of dusky gopher frogs are:

(A) An open canopy with emergent herbaceous vegetation for egg attachment;

(B) An absence of large, predatory fish that prey on frog larvae;

(C) Water quality such that frogs, their eggs, or larvae are not exposed to pesticides or chemicals and sediment associated with road runoff; and

(D) Surface water that lasts for a minimum of 195 days during the breeding season to allow a sufficient period for larvae to hatch, mature, and metamorphose.

(ii) *Upland forested nonbreeding habitat.* Forests historically dominated by longleaf pine, adjacent to and accessible to and from breeding ponds, that are maintained by fires frequent enough to support an open canopy and abundant herbaceous ground cover and gopher tortoise burrows, small mammal burrows, stump holes, or other underground habitat that the dusky gopher frog depends upon for food, shelter, and protection from the elements and predation.

(iii) *Upland connectivity habitat.* Accessible upland habitat between breeding and nonbreeding habitats to allow for dusky gopher frog movements between and among such sites. This habitat is characterized by an open canopy, abundant native herbaceous species, and a subsurface structure that provides shelter for dusky gopher frogs during seasonal movements, such as that created by deep litter cover, clumps of grass, or burrows.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat unit maps.* Data layers defining map units were developed from USGS 7.5' quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

Mountain Yellow-Legged Frog (*Rana muscosa*), Northern California DPS

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Fresno, Inyo and Tulare Counties, California, on the maps in this entry.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the northern DPS of the mountain yellow-legged frog consist of:

(i) *Aquatic habitat for breeding and rearing.* Habitat that consists of permanent water bodies, or those that are either hydrologically connected with, or close to, permanent water bodies, including, but not limited to, lakes, streams, rivers, tarns, perennial creeks (or permanent plunge pools within intermittent creeks), pools (such as a body of impounded water contained above a natural dam), and other forms of aquatic habitat. This habitat must:

(A) For lakes, be of sufficient depth not to freeze solid (to the bottom) during the winter (no less than 1.7 meters (m) (5.6 feet (ft)), but generally greater than 2.5 m (8.2 ft), and optimally 5 m (16.4 ft) or deeper (unless some other refuge from freezing is available)).

(B) Maintain a natural flow pattern, including periodic flooding, and have functional community dynamics in order to provide sufficient productivity and a prey base to support the growth and development of rearing tadpoles and metamorphs.

(C) Be free of introduced predators.

(D) Maintain water during the entire tadpole growth phase (a minimum of 2 years). During periods of drought, these breeding sites may not hold water long enough for individuals to complete metamorphosis, but they may still be considered essential breeding habitat if they provide sufficient habitat in most years to foster recruitment within the reproductive lifespan of individual adult frogs.

(E) Contain:

(*1*) Bank and pool substrates consisting of varying percentages of soil or silt, sand, gravel, cobble, rock, and boulders (for basking and cover);

(*2*) Shallower microhabitat with solar exposure to warm lake areas and to foster primary productivity of the food web;

(*3*) Open gravel banks and rocks or other structures projecting above or just beneath the surface of the water for adult sunning posts;

(*4*) Aquatic refugia, including pools with bank overhangs, downfall logs or branches, or rocks and vegetation to provide cover from predators; and

(*5*) Sufficient food resources to provide for tadpole growth and development.

(ii) *Aquatic nonbreeding habitat (including overwintering habitat).* This habitat may contain the same characteristics as aquatic breeding and rearing habitat (often at the same locale), and may include lakes, ponds, tarns, streams, rivers, creeks, plunge pools within intermittent creeks, seeps, and springs that may not hold water long enough for the species to complete its aquatic life cycle. This habitat provides for shelter, foraging, predator avoidance, and aquatic dispersal of juvenile and adult mountain yellow-legged frogs. Aquatic nonbreeding habitat contains:

(A) Bank and pool substrates consisting of varying percentages of soil or silt, sand, gravel, cobble, rock, and boulders (for basking and cover);

(B) Open gravel banks and rocks projecting above or just beneath the surface of the water for adult sunning posts;

(C) Aquatic refugia, including pools with bank overhangs, downfall logs or branches, or rocks and vegetation to provide cover from predators;

(D) Sufficient food resources to support juvenile and adult foraging;

(E) Overwintering refugia, where thermal properties of the microhabitat protect hibernating life stages from winter freezing, such as crevices or holes within bedrock, in and near shore; and/or

(F) Streams, stream reaches, or wet meadow habitats that can function as corridors for movement between aquatic habitats used as breeding or foraging sites.

(iii) *Upland areas.*

(A) Upland areas adjacent to or surrounding breeding and nonbreeding aquatic habitat that provide area for feeding and movement by mountain yellow-legged frogs.

(*1*) For stream habitats, this area extends 25 m (82 ft) from the bank or shoreline.

(*2*) In areas that contain riparian habitat and upland vegetation (for example, mixed conifer, ponderosa pine, montane conifer, and montane riparian woodlands), the canopy overstory should be sufficiently thin (generally not to exceed 85 percent) to allow sunlight to reach the aquatic habitat and thereby provide basking areas for the species.

(*3*) For areas between proximate (within 300 m (984 ft)) water bodies (typical of some high mountain lake habitats), the upland area extends from the bank or shoreline between such water bodies.

(*4*) Within mesic habitats such as lake and meadow systems, the entire area of physically contiguous or proximate habitat is suitable for dispersal and foraging.

(B) Upland areas (catchments) adjacent to and surrounding both breeding and nonbreeding aquatic habitat that provide for the natural hydrologic regime (water quantity) of aquatic habitats. These upland areas should also allow for the maintenance of sufficient water quality to provide for the various life stages of the frog and its prey base.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries of designated critical habitat on September 26, 2016.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* The critical habitat subunit maps were originally created using ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop 10.2.1 software and then exported as .emf files. All maps are in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10N. The California County Boundaries dataset (Teale Data Center), and the USA Minor Highways, USA Major Roads, and USA Rivers and Streams layers (ESRI's 2010 StreetMap Data) were incorporated as base layers to assist in the geographic location of the critical habitat subunits.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Riverside Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the mountain yellow-legged frog are:

(i) Water source(s) found between 1,214 to 7,546 ft (370 to 2,300 m) in elevation that are permanent. Water sources include, but are not limited to, streams, rivers, perennial creeks (or permanent plunge pools within intermittent creeks), pools (*i.e.*, a body of impounded water that is contained above a natural dam), and other forms of aquatic habitat. The water source should maintain a natural flow pattern including periodic natural flooding. Aquatic habitats that are used by mountain yellow-legged frog for breeding purposes must maintain water during the entire tadpole growth phase, which can be up to 2 years duration. During periods of drought, or less than average rainfall, these breeding sites may not hold water long enough for individuals to complete metamorphosis, but they would still be considered essential breeding habitat in wetter years. Further, the aquatic habitat includes:

(A) Bank and pool substrates consisting of varying percentages of soil or silt, sand, gravel cobble, rock, and boulders;

(B) Open gravel banks and rocks projecting above or just beneath the surface of the water for sunning posts;

(C) Aquatic refugia, including pools with bank overhangs, downfall logs or branches, and/or rocks to provide cover from predators; and

(D) Streams or stream reaches between known occupied sites that can function as corridors for adults and frogs for movement between aquatic habitats used as breeding and/or foraging sites.

(ii) Riparian habitat and upland vegetation (e.g., ponderosa pine, montane hardwood-conifer, montane riparian woodlands, and chaparral) extending 262 feet (80 m) from each side of the centerline of each identified stream and its tributaries, that provides areas for feeding and movement of mountain yellow-legged frog, with a canopy overstory not exceeding 85 percent that allows sunlight to reach the stream and thereby provides basking areas for the species.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.

(4) *Critical Habitat Map Units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5' quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. *Note:* Index map of critical habitat units for the southern California DPS of the mountain yellow-legged frog (Map 1) follows:

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Lassen, Plumas, Sierra, Nevada, Placer, El Dorado, Amador, Alpine, Calaveras, Tuolumne, Mono, Mariposa, Madera, Fresno, and Inyo Counties, California, on the maps in this entry.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Sierra Nevada yellow-legged frog consist of:

(i) *Aquatic habitat for breeding and rearing.* Habitat that consists of permanent water bodies, or those that are either hydrologically connected with, or close to, permanent water bodies, including, but not limited to, lakes, streams, rivers, tarns, perennial creeks (or permanent plunge pools within intermittent creeks), pools (such as a body of impounded water contained above a natural dam), and other forms of aquatic habitat. This habitat must:

(A) For lakes, be of sufficient depth not to freeze solid (to the bottom) during the winter (no less than 1.7 meters (m) (5.6 feet (ft)), but generally greater than 2.5 m (8.2 ft), and optimally 5 m (16.4 ft) or deeper (unless some other refuge from freezing is available)).

(B) Maintain a natural flow pattern, including periodic flooding, and have functional community dynamics in order to provide sufficient productivity and a prey base to support the growth and development of rearing tadpoles and metamorphs.

(C) Be free of introduced predators.

(D) Maintain water during the entire tadpole growth phase (a minimum of 2 years). During periods of drought, these breeding sites may not hold water long enough for individuals to complete metamorphosis, but they may still be considered essential breeding habitat if they provide sufficient habitat in most years to foster recruitment within the reproductive lifespan of individual adult frogs.

(E) Contain:

(*1*) Bank and pool substrates consisting of varying percentages of soil or silt, sand, gravel, cobble, rock, and boulders (for basking and cover);

(*2*) Shallower microhabitat with solar exposure to warm lake areas and to foster primary productivity of the food web;

(*3*) Open gravel banks and rocks or other structures projecting above or just beneath the surface of the water for adult sunning posts;

(*4*) Aquatic refugia, including pools with bank overhangs, downfall logs or branches, or rocks and vegetation to provide cover from predators; and

(*5*) Sufficient food resources to provide for tadpole growth and development.

(ii) *Aquatic nonbreeding habitat (including overwintering habitat).* This habitat may contain the same characteristics as aquatic breeding and rearing habitat (often at the same locale), and may include lakes, ponds, tarns, streams, rivers, creeks, plunge pools within intermittent creeks, seeps, and springs that may not hold water long enough for the species to complete its aquatic life cycle. This habitat provides for shelter, foraging, predator avoidance, and aquatic dispersal of juvenile and adult mountain yellow-legged frogs. Aquatic nonbreeding habitat contains:

(A) Bank and pool substrates consisting of varying percentages of soil or silt, sand, gravel, cobble, rock, and boulders (for basking and cover);

(B) Open gravel banks and rocks projecting above or just beneath the surface of the water for adult sunning posts;

(C) Aquatic refugia, including pools with bank overhangs, downfall logs or branches, or rocks and vegetation to provide cover from predators;

(D) Sufficient food resources to support juvenile and adult foraging;

(E) Overwintering refugia, where thermal properties of the microhabitat protect hibernating life stages from winter freezing, such as crevices or holes within bedrock, in and near shore; and/or

(F) Streams, stream reaches, or wet meadow habitats that can function as corridors for movement between aquatic habitats used as breeding or foraging sites.

(iii) *Upland areas.*

(A) Upland areas adjacent to or surrounding breeding and nonbreeding aquatic habitat that provide area for feeding and movement by mountain yellow-legged frogs.

(*1*) For stream habitats, this area extends 25 m (82 ft) from the bank or shoreline.

(*2*) In areas that contain riparian habitat and upland vegetation (for example, mixed conifer, ponderosa pine, montane conifer, and montane riparian woodlands), the canopy overstory should be sufficiently thin (generally not to exceed 85 percent) to allow sunlight to reach the aquatic habitat and thereby provide basking areas for the species.

(*3*) For areas between proximate (within 300 m (984 ft)) water bodies (typical of some high mountain lake habitats), the upland area extends from the bank or shoreline between such water bodies.

(*4*) Within mesic habitats such as lake and meadow systems, the entire area of physically contiguous or proximate habitat is suitable for dispersal and foraging.

(B) Upland areas (catchments) adjacent to and surrounding both breeding and nonbreeding aquatic habitat that provide for the natural hydrologic regime (water quantity) of aquatic habitats. These upland areas should also allow for the maintenance of sufficient water quality to provide for the various life stages of the frog and its prey base.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries of designated critical habitat on September 26, 2016.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* The critical habitat subunit maps were originally created using ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop 10.2.1 software and then exported as .emf files. All maps are in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10N. The California County Boundaries dataset (Teale Data Center), and the USA Minor Highways, USA Major Roads, and USA Rivers and Streams layers (ESRI's 2010 StreetMap Data) were incorporated as base layers to assist in the geographic location of the critical habitat subunits. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public on *http://regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2012-0074, on our Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/sacramento*), and at the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office, 2800 Cottage Way Room W-2605, Sacramento, CA 95825.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Humacao, Las Piedras, Maunabo, Patillas, and Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the guajón are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Subtropical forest (which may include trees such as *Cecropia schreberiana*, *Dendropanax arboreus*, *Guarea guidonia*, *Piper aduncum*, *Spathodea campanulata*, *Syzygium jambos*, and *Thespesia populnea*) at elevations from 118 to 1,183 ft (36 to 361 m) above sea level;

(ii) Plutonic, granitic, or sedimentary rocks/boulders that form caves, crevices, and grottoes (interstitial spaces) in a streambed, and that are in proximity, or connected, to a permanent, ephemeral, or subterranean clear-water stream or water source. The interstitial spaces between or underneath rocks provide microenvironments characterized by generally higher humidity and cooler temperatures than outside the rock formations; and

(iii) Vegetation-covered rocks (the vegetation typically includes moss, ferns, and hepatics such as *Thuidium urceolatum*, *Taxilejeunea sulphurea*, and *Huokeria acutifolia*) extending laterally to a maximum of 99 feet (30 meters) on each bank of the stream. These rocks provide cover and foraging sites and help conserve humidity.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, driveways, aqueducts, airports, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.

(4) *Critical habitat maps.* Data layers defining map units were created by delineating habitats that contain at least one or more of the PCEs defined in paragraph (2) of this entry, over United States Geological Survey topographic maps (UTM 19, NAD 83). USGS 1:20,000 quadrangles used in the base map were: Humacao, Punta Guayanés, Juncos, Yabucoa, Punta Tuna, and Patillas.

![](/graphics/er23oc07.013.gif)Austin Blind Salamander (*Eurycea waterlooensis*)

(1) The critical habitat unit is depicted for Travis County, Texas, on the map below.

(2) Within this area, the primary constituent elements (PCEs) of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Austin blind salamander consist of six components:

(i) Surface habitat PCEs.

(A) *Water from the Barton Springs Segment of the Edwards Aquifer.* The groundwater is similar to natural aquifer conditions as it discharges from natural spring outlets. Concentrations of water quality constituents and contaminants are below levels that could exert direct lethal or sublethal effects (such as effects to reproduction, growth, development, or metabolic processes), or indirect effects (such as effects to the Austin blind salamander's prey base). Hydrologic regimes similar to the historical pattern of the specific sites are present, with constant surface flow. The water chemistry is similar to natural aquifer conditions, with temperatures from 67.8 to 72.3 °F (19.9 and 22.4 °C), dissolved oxygen concentrations from 5 to 7 mg L−1, and specific water conductance from 605 to 740 µS cm−1.

(B) *Rocky substrate with interstitial spaces.* Rocks in the substrate of the salamander's surface aquatic habitat are large enough to provide salamanders with cover, shelter, and foraging habitat (larger than 2.5 in (64 mm)). The substrate and interstitial spaces have minimal sedimentation.

(C) *Aquatic invertebrates for food.* The spring environment supports a diverse aquatic invertebrate community that includes crustaceans, insects, and flatworms.

(D) *Subterranean aquifer.* Access to the subsurface water table exists to provide shelter, protection, and space for reproduction. This access can occur in the form of large conduits that carry water to the spring outlet or fissures in the bedrock.

(ii) Subsurface habitat PCEs.

(A) *Water from the Barton Springs Segment of the Edwards Aquifer.* The groundwater is similar to natural aquifer conditions. Concentrations of water quality constituents and contaminants are below levels that could exert direct lethal or sublethal effects (such as effects to reproduction, growth, development, or metabolic processes), or indirect effects (such as effects to the Austin blind salamander's prey base). Hydrologic regimes similar to the historical pattern of the specific sites are present, with continuous flow in the subterranean habitat. The water chemistry is similar to natural aquifer conditions, including temperature, dissolved oxygen, and specific water conductance.

(B) *Subsurface spaces.* Conduits underground are large enough to provide salamanders with cover, shelter, and foraging habitat.

(C) *Aquatic invertebrates for food.* The habitat supports an aquatic invertebrate community that includes crustaceans, insects, or flatworms.

(3) Surface critical habitat includes the spring outlets and outflow up to the high water line and 262 ft (80 m) of upstream and downstream habitat, including the dry stream channel during periods of no surface flow. The surface critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule; however, the subsurface critical habitat may extend below such structures. The subsurface critical habitat includes underground features in a circle with a radius of 984 ft (300 m) around the springs.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using a geographic information system (GIS), which included species locations, roads, property boundaries, 2011 aerial photography, and USGS 7.5′ quadrangles. Points were placed on the GIS. We delineated critical habitat unit boundaries by starting with the cave or spring point locations that are occupied by the salamanders. From these cave or springs points, we delineated a circle with a 984-ft (300-m) radius to create the polygons that capture the extent to which we believe the salamander populations exist through underground conduits. The polygons were then simplified to reduce the number of vertices, but still retain the overall shape and extent. Subsequently, polygons that were within 98 ft (30 m) of each other were merged together. Each new merged polygon was then revised to remove extraneous divots or protrusions that resulted from the merge process. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the field office Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/AustinTexas/*), *www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2013-0001 and at the Service's Austin Ecological Services Field Office. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Santa Barbara County, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements (PCEs) of critical habitat for the California tiger salamander in Santa Barbara County are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Standing bodies of fresh water, including natural and man-made (e.g., stock) ponds, vernal pools, and dune ponds, and other ephemeral or permanent water bodies that typically become inundated during winter rains and hold water for a sufficient length of time (*i.e.*, 12 weeks) necessary for the species to complete the aquatic portion of its life cycle (PCE 1).

(ii) Barrier-free uplands adjacent to breeding ponds that contain small mammal burrows, including but not limited to burrows created by the California ground squirrel (*Spermophilus beecheyi*) and Botta's pocket gopher (*Thommomys bottae*). Small mammals are essential in creating the underground habitat that adult California tiger salamanders depend upon for food, shelter, and protection from the elements and predation (PCE 2).

(iii) Upland areas between breeding locations (PCE 1) and areas with small mammal burrows (PCE 2) that allow for dispersal among such sites (PCE 3).

(3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and structures, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads and their rights of way, and other developed areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) Final critical habitat units are described below. Coordinate in UTM Zone 10 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27).

(52) The critical habitat unit for Sonoma County, CA, is depicted on the map at paragraph (56)(ii) of this entry.

(53) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the California tiger salamander in Sonoma County consist of three components:

(i) Standing bodies of fresh water (including natural and manmade (e.g., stock)) ponds, vernal pools, and other ephemeral or permanent water bodies) that typically support inundation during winter and early spring, and hold water for a minimum of 12 consecutive weeks in a year of average rainfall.

(ii) Upland habitats adjacent to and accessible from breeding ponds that contain small mammal burrows or other underground refugia that the species depends upon for food, shelter, and protection from the elements and predation.

(iii) Accessible upland dispersal habitat between locations occupied by the species that allow for movement between such sites.

(54) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(55) *Critical habitat map unit.* Data layers defining the map unit were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles, and the critical habitat unit was then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10N coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Baker, Franklin, Jefferson, Liberty, and Wakulla Counties in Florida; and Berkeley, Charleston, and Jasper Counties in South Carolina on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the frosted flatwoods salamander are:

(i) *Breeding habitat.* Small (generally less than 1 to 10 ac (less than 0.4 to 4.0 ha)), acidic, depressional standing bodies of freshwater (wetlands) that:

(A) Are seasonally flooded by rainfall in late fall or early winter and dry in late spring or early summer;

(B) Are geographically isolated from other water bodies;

(C) Occur within pine flatwoods-savanna communities;

(D) Are dominated by grasses and grass-like species in the ground layer and overstories of pond-cypress, blackgum, and slash pine;

(E) Have a relatively open canopy, necessary to maintain the herbaceous component that serves as cover for flatwoods salamander larvae and their aquatic invertebrate prey; and

(F) Typically have a burrowing crayfish fauna, but, due to periodic drying, the breeding ponds typically lack large, predatory fish (for example, *Lepomis* (sunfish), *Micropterus* (bass), *Amia calva* (bowfin)).

(ii) *Non-breeding habitat.* Upland pine flatwoods-savanna habitat that is open, mesic woodland maintained by frequent fires and that:

(A) Is within 1,500 ft (457 m) of adjacent and accessible breeding ponds;

(B) Contains crayfish burrows or other underground habitat that the flatwoods salamander depends upon for food, shelter, and protection from the elements and predation;

(C) Has an organic hardpan in the soil profile, which inhibits subsurface water penetration and typically results in moist soils with water often at or near the surface under normal conditions; and

(D) Often has wiregrasses as the dominant grasses in the abundant herbaceous ground cover, which supports the rich herbivorous invertebrates that serve as a food source for the frosted flatwoods salamander.

(iii) *Dispersal habitat.* Upland habitat areas between nonbreeding and breeding habitat that allows for salamander movement between such sites and that is characterized by:

(A) A mix of vegetation types representing a transition between wetland and upland vegetation (ecotone);

(B) An open canopy and abundant native herbaceous species;

(C) Moist soils as described in paragraph (2)(ii); and

(D) Subsurface structure, such as that provided by deep litter cover or burrows, that provides shelter for salamanders during seasonal movements.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Los Alamos, Rio Arriba, and Sandoval Counties, New Mexico, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Jemez Mountains salamander consist of four components:

(i) Moderate to high tree canopy cover, typically 50 to 100 percent canopy closure, that provides shade and maintains moisture and high relative humidity at the ground surface, and:

(A) Consists of the following tree species alone or in any combination: Douglas fir (*Pseudotsuga menziesii*); blue spruce (*Picea pungens*); Engelman spruce (*Picea engelmannii*); white fir (*Abies concolor*); limber pine (*Pinus flexilis*); Ponderosa pine (*Pinus ponderosa*); and aspen (*Populus tremuloides*); and

Jollyville Plateau Salamander (*Eurycea tonkawae*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Travis and Williamson Counties, Texas, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Jollyville Plateau salamander consist of six components:

(i) Surface habitat PCEs.

(A) *Water from the Trinity Aquifer, Northern Segment of the Edwards Aquifer, and local alluvial aquifers.* The groundwater is similar to natural aquifer conditions as it discharges from natural spring outlets. Concentrations of water quality constituents and contaminants should be below levels that could exert direct lethal or sublethal effects (such as effects to reproduction, growth, development, or metabolic processes), or indirect effects (such as effects to the Jollyville Plateau salamander's prey base). Hydrologic regimes similar to the historical pattern of the specific sites are present, with at least some surface flow during the year. The water chemistry is similar to natural aquifer conditions, with temperatures from 64.1 to 73.4 °F (17.9 to 23 °C), dissolved oxygen concentrations from 5.6 to 8 mg L−1, and specific water conductance from 550 to 721 µS cm−1.

(B) *Rocky substrate with interstitial spaces.* Rocks in the substrate of the salamander's surface aquatic habitat are large enough to provide salamanders with cover, shelter, and foraging habitat (larger than 2.5 in (64 mm)). The substrate and interstitial spaces have minimal sedimentation.

(C) *Aquatic invertebrates for food.* The spring environment supports a diverse aquatic invertebrate community that includes crustaceans, insects, and flatworms.

(D) *Subterranean aquifer.* Access to the subsurface water table should exist to provide shelter, protection, and space for reproduction. This access can occur in the form of large conduits that carry water to the spring outlet or porous voids between rocks in the streambed that extend down into the water table.

(ii) Subsurface habitat PCEs.

(A) *Water from the Trinity Aquifer, Northern Segment of the Edwards Aquifer, and local alluvial aquifers.* The groundwater is similar to natural aquifer conditions. Concentrations of water quality constituents and contaminants are below levels that could exert direct lethal or sublethal effects (such as effects to reproduction, growth, development, or metabolic processes), or indirect effects (such as effects to the Jollyville Plateau salamander's prey base). Hydrologic regimes similar to the historical pattern of the specific sites are present, with continuous flow. The water chemistry is similar to natural aquifer conditions, including temperature, dissolved oxygen, and specific water conductance.

(B) *Subsurface spaces.* Voids between rocks underground are large enough to provide salamanders with cover, shelter, and foraging habitat. These spaces have minimal sedimentation.

(C) *Aquatic invertebrates for food.* The habitat supports an aquatic invertebrate community that includes crustaceans, insects, or flatworms.

(3) Surface critical habitat includes the spring outlets and outflow up to the high water line and 262 ft (80 m) of upstream and downstream habitat, including the dry stream channel during periods of no surface flow. The surface critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule; however, the subsurface critical habitat may extend below such structures. The subsurface critical habitat includes underground features in a circle with a radius of 984 ft (300 m) around the springs.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using a geographic information system (GIS), which included species locations, roads, property boundaries, 2011 aerial photography, and USGS 7.5′ quadrangles. Points were placed on the GIS. We delineated critical habitat unit boundaries by starting with the cave or spring point locations that are occupied by the salamanders. From these cave or springs points, we delineated a 984-ft (300-m) buffer to create the polygons that capture the extent to which we believe the salamander populations exist through underground conduits. The polygons were then simplified to reduce the number of vertices, but still retain the overall shape and extent. Subsequently, polygons that were within 98 ft (30 m) of each other were merged together. Each new merged polygon was then revised to remove extraneous divots or protrusions that resulted from the merge process. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the field office Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/AustinTexas/), http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2013-0001 and at the Service's Austin Ecological Services Field Office.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Calhoun, Holmes, Jackson, Santa Rosa, Walton, and Washington Counties in Florida; and Baker and Miller Counties in Georgia on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the reticulated flatwoods salamander are the habitat components that provide:

(i) *Breeding habitat.* Small (generally less than 1 to 10 ac (less than 0.4 to 4.0 ha)), acidic, depressional standing bodies of freshwater (wetlands) that:

(A) Are seasonally flooded by rainfall in late fall or early winter and dry in late spring or early summer;

(B) Are geographically isolated from other water bodies;

(C) Occur within pine flatwoods-savanna communities;

(D) Are dominated by grasses and grass-like species in the ground layer and overstories of pond-cypress, blackgum, and slash pine;

(E) Have a relatively open canopy, necessary to maintain the herbaceous component that serves as cover for flatwoods salamander larvae and their aquatic invertebrate prey; and

(F) Typically have a burrowing crayfish fauna, but, due to periodic drying, the breeding ponds typically lack large, predatory fish (for example, *Lepomis* (sunfish), *Micropterus* (bass), *Amia calva* (bowfin)).

(ii) *Non-breeding habitat.* Upland pine flatwoods-savanna habitat that is open, mesic woodland maintained by frequent fires and that:

(A) Is within 1,500 ft (457 m) of adjacent and accessible breeding ponds;

(B) Contains crayfish burrows or other underground habitat that the flatwoods salamander depends upon for food, shelter, and protection from the elements and predation;

(C) Has an organic hardpan in the soil profile, which inhibits subsurface water penetration and typically results in moist soils with water often at or near the surface under normal conditions; and

(D) Often has wiregrasses as the dominant grasses in the abundant herbaceous ground cover, which supports the rich herbivorous invertebrates that serve as a food source for the reticulated flatwoods salamander.

(iii) *Dispersal habitat.* Upland habitat areas between nonbreeding and breeding habitat that allows for salamander movement between such sites and that is characterized by:

(A) A mix of vegetation types representing a transition between wetland and upland vegetation (ecotone);

(B) An open canopy and abundant native herbaceous species;

(C) Moist soils as described in paragraph (2)(ii); and

(D) Subsurface structure, such as deep litter cover or burrows that provide shelter for salamanders during seasonal movements.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

![](/graphics/ec01jn91.082.gif)Arroyo Toad (*Anaxyrus californicus*).

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Ventura Counties, California, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements for the arroyo toad consist of four components:

(i) Rivers or streams with hydrologic regimes that supply water to provide space, food, and cover needed to sustain eggs, tadpoles, metamorphosing juveniles, and adult breeding toads. Breeding pools must persist a minimum of 2 months for the completion of larval development. However, due to the dynamic nature of southern California riparian systems and flood regimes, the location of suitable breeding pools may vary from year to year. Specifically, the conditions necessary to allow for successful reproduction of arroyo toads are:

(A) Breeding pools that are less than 6 inches (15 centimeters) deep;

(B) Areas of flowing water with current velocities less than 1.3 feet per second (40 centimeters per second); and

(C) Surface water that lasts for a minimum of 2 months during the breeding season (a sufficient wet period in the spring months to allow arroyo toad larvae to hatch, mature, and metamorphose).

(ii) Riparian and adjacent upland habitats, particularly low-gradient (typically less than 6 percent) stream segments and alluvial streamside terraces with sandy or fine gravel substrates that support the formation of shallow pools and sparsely vegetated sand and gravel bars for breeding and rearing of tadpoles and juveniles; and adjacent valley bottomlands that include areas of loose soil where toads can burrow underground, to provide foraging and living areas for juvenile and adult arroyo toads.

(iii) A natural flooding regime, or one sufficiently corresponding to natural, that:

(A) Is characterized by intermittent or near-perennial flow that contributes to the persistence of shallow pools into at least mid-summer;

(B) Maintains areas of open, sparsely vegetated, sandy stream channels and terraces by periodically scouring riparian vegetation; and

(C) Also modifies stream channels and terraces and redistributes sand and sediment, such that breeding pools and terrace habitats with scattered vegetation are maintained.

(iv) Stream channels and adjacent upland habitats that allow for movement to breeding pools, foraging areas, overwintering sites, upstream and downstream dispersal, and connectivity to areas that contain suitable habitat.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5' quadrangles using USDA National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) county-wide MrSID compressed mosaics of 1 meter resolution and natural color aerial photography from summer 2009. Except where otherwise noted, critical habitat units were mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 11, North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83) coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Alpine, Tuolumne, Mono, Mariposa, Madera, Fresno, and Inyo Counties, California, on the maps in this entry.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Yosemite toad consist of two components:

(i) *Aquatic breeding habitat.*

(A) This habitat consists of bodies of fresh water, including wet meadows, slow-moving streams, shallow ponds, spring systems, and shallow areas of lakes, that:

(*1*) Are typically (or become) inundated during snowmelt;

(*2*) Hold water for a minimum of 5 weeks, but more typically 7 to 8 weeks; and

(*3*) Contain sufficient food for tadpole development.

(B) During periods of drought or less than average rainfall, these breeding sites may not hold surface water long enough for individual Yosemite toads to complete metamorphosis, but they are still considered essential breeding habitat because they provide habitat in most years.

(ii) *Upland areas.*

(A) This habitat consists of areas adjacent to or surrounding breeding habitat up to a distance of 1.25 kilometers (0.78 miles) in most cases (that is, depending on surrounding landscape and dispersal barriers), including seeps, springheads, talus and boulders, and areas that provide:

(*1*) Sufficient cover (including rodent burrows, logs, rocks, and other surface objects) to provide summer refugia,

(*2*) Foraging habitat,

(*3*) Adequate prey resources,

(*4*) Physical structure for predator avoidance,

(*5*) Overwintering refugia for juvenile and adult Yosemite toads,

(*6*) Dispersal corridors between aquatic breeding habitats,

(*7*) Dispersal corridors between breeding habitats and areas of suitable summer and winter refugia and foraging habitat, and/or

(*8*) The natural hydrologic regime of aquatic habitats (the catchment).

(B) These upland areas should also maintain sufficient water quality to provide for the various life stages of the Yosemite toad and its prey base.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries of designated critical habitat on September 26, 2016.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* The critical habitat subunit maps were originally created using ESRI's ArcGIS Desktop 10 software and then exported as .emf files. All maps are in the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 10N. The California County Boundaries dataset (Teale Data Center), and the USA Minor Highways, USA Major Roads, and USA Rivers and Streams layers (ESRI's 2010 StreetMap Data) were incorporated as base layers to assist in the geographic location of the critical habitat subunits. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public on *http://regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2012-0074, on our Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/sacramento*), and at the Sacramento Fish and Wildlife Office, 2800 Cottage Way Room W-2605, Sacramento, CA 95825.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Blount, Etowah, Jefferson, Lawrence, Marshall, Tuscaloosa, Walker, and Winston Counties, Alabama, on the maps in this entry.

(2) Within these areas, the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Black Warrior waterdog, which describe a riverine system with habitat to support all life-history stages of the Black Warrior waterdog, consists of the following components:

(i) Geomorphically stable, medium to large streams (typically 4 meters (m) (13 feet (ft)) wide or greater) with:

(A) Substrate consisting of clay or bedrock with little sand, and containing abundant rock crevices, rock slabs, and leaf packs;

(B) Moderate water velocity; and

(C) Prey base of aquatic macroinvertebrates.

(ii) Water that lacks harmful levels of pollutants, including inorganic contaminants such as copper, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium; organic contaminants such as human and animal waste products; endocrine-disrupting chemicals; pesticides; nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus fertilizers; and petroleum distillates.

(iii) Appropriate water quality parameters to support Black Warrior waterdog and primary prey base, including:

(A) Water temperature not exceeding 85° F;

(B) Dissolved oxygen 5.5 milligrams per liter (mg/L) or greater;

(C) Turbidity of an average monthly reading of 15 nephelometric turbidity units above background readings;

(1) Critical habitat for the Gila chub in Grant County, New Mexico, and Yavapai, Gila, Greenlee, Graham, Cochise, Pima, Santa Cruz, and Pinal Counties in Arizona is described in detail and depicted on the following maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements are the following:

(i) Perennial pools, areas of higher velocity between pool areas, and areas of shallow water among plants or eddies all found in small segments of headwaters, springs, or cienegas of smaller tributaries;

(ii) Water temperatures for spawning ranging from 17 to 24 °C (62.6 to 75.2 °F), and seasonally appropriate temperatures for all life stages (e.g., varying from approximately 10 °C to 30 °C);

(iii) Water quality with reduced levels of contaminants, including excessive levels of sediments adverse to Gila chub health, and adequate levels of pH (e.g., ranging from 6.5 to 9.5), dissolved oxygen (e.g., ranging from 3.0 to 10.0) and conductivity (e.g., 100 to 1000 mmhos);

(iv) Food base consisting of invertebrates (e.g., aquatic and terrestrial insects) and aquatic plants (e.g., diatoms and filamentous green algae);

(v) Sufficient cover consisting of downed logs in the water channel, submerged aquatic vegetation, submerged large tree root wads, undercut banks with sufficient overhanging vegetation, large rocks and boulders with overhangs, and a high degree of streambank stability and healthy, intact riparian vegetative community;

(vi) Habitat devoid of nonnative aquatic species detrimental to Gila chub or habitat in which detrimental nonnatives are kept at a level that allows Gila chub to continue to survive and reproduce; and

(vii) Streams that maintain a natural flow pattern including periodic flooding.

(3) Each stream segment includes a lateral component that consists of 300 feet on either side of the stream channel measured from the stream edge at bank full discharge. This lateral component of critical habitat is intended as a surrogate for the 100-year floodplain.

(4) Lands located within the boundaries of the critical habitat designation, but are excluded by definition include: Existing paved roads; bridges; parking lots; dikes; levees; diversion structures; railroad tracks; railroad trestles; water diversion canals outside of natural stream channels; active gravel pits; cultivated agricultural land; and residential, commercial, and industrial developments. These developed areas do not contain any of the primary constituent elements, do not provide habitat or biological features essential to the conservation of the Gila chub, and generally will not contribute to the species' recovery.

(5) Critical Habitat Map Areas. Data layers defining map areas, and mapping of critical habitat areas, was done using Arc GIS and verifying with USGS 7.5′ quadrangles. Legal descriptions for New Mexico and Arizona are based on the Public Lands Survey System (PLSS). Within this system, all coordinates reported for New Mexico are in the New Mexico Principal Meridian (NMPM), while those in Arizona are in the Gila and Salt River Meridian (GSRM). Township has been abbreviated as “T”, Range as “R”, and section as “sec.” Where possible, the ending or starting points have been described to the nearest quarter-section, abbreviated as “1/4”. Cardinal directions are also abbreviated (N = North, S = South, W = West, and E = East). All mileage calculations were performed using GIS.

Legal descriptions for St. George (Utah-Arizona) and Littlefield (Arizona) were obtained from the 1987 Bureau of Land Management (BLM) maps (Surface Management Status 30 × 60 Minute Quadrangle). Legal descriptions for Overton (Nevada-Arizona) were obtained from the 1989 BLM maps (Surface Management Status 30 × 60 Minute Quadrangle). The 100-year floodplain for many areas is detailed in Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) published by and available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In areas where a FIRM is not available, the presence of alluvium soils or known high water marks can be used to determine the extent of the floodplain. Only areas of floodplain containing at least one of the constituent elements are considered critical habitat. Critical habitat designated for the Virgin River chub is as follows:

Utah, Washington County; Arizona, Mohave County; Nevada, Clark County. The Virgin River and its 100-year floodplain from its confluence with La Verkin Creek, Utah in T.41S., R.13W., sec.23 (Salt Lake Base and Meridian) to Halfway Wash, Nevada T.15S., R.69E., sec.6 (Salt Lake Base and Meridian).

The primary constituent elements of critical habitat determined necessary for the survival and recovery of these Virgin River fishes are water, physical habitat, and biological environment. The desired conditions for each of these elements are further discussed below.

Water - A sufficient quantity and quality of water (*i.e.,* temperature, dissolved oxygen, contaminants, nutrients, turbidity, etc.) that is delivered to a specific location in accordance with a hydrologic regime that is identified for the particular life stage for each species. This includes the following:

1. Water quality characterized by natural seasonally variable temperature, turbidity, and conductivity;

2. hydrologic regime characterized by the duration, magnitude, and frequency of flow events capable of forming and maintaining channel and instream habitat necessary for particular life stages at certain times of the year; and

3. flood events inundating the floodplain necessary to provide the organic matter that provides or supports the nutrient and food sources for the listed fishes.

Physical Habitat - Areas of the Virgin River that are inhabited or potentially habitable by a particular life stage for each species, for use in spawning, nursing, feeding, and rearing, or corridors between such areas:

1. River channels, side channels, secondary channels, backwaters, and springs, and other areas which provide access to these habitats; and

2. areas with slow to moderate velocities, within deep runs or pools, with predominately sand substrates, particularly habitats which contain boulders or other instream cover.

Biological Environment - Food supply, predation, and competition are important elements of the biological environment and are considered components of this constituent element. Food supply is a function of nutrient supply, productivity, and availability to each life stage of the species. Predation and competition, although considered normal components of this environment, are out of balance due to nonnative fish species in many areas. Fourteen introduced species, including red shiner (*Cyprinella lutrensis*), black bullhead (*Ameiurus melas*), channel catfish (*Ictalurus punctatus*), and largemouth bass (*Micropterus salmoides*), compete with or prey upon the listed fishes. Of these, the red shiner is the most numerous and has been the most problematic for the listed fishes. Red shiners compete for food and available habitats and are known to prey on the eggs and early life stages of the listed fishes. Components of this constituent element include the following:

1. Seasonally flooded areas that contribute to the biological productivity of the river system by producing allochthonous (humus, silt, organic detritus, colloidal matter, and plants and animals produced outside the river and brought into the river) organic matter which provides and supports much of the food base of the listed fishes; and

2. few or no predatory or competitive nonnative species in occupied Virgin River fishes' habitats or potential reestablishment sites.

Primary constituent elements of the habitat are considered to be quantity, and thermal and chemical quality of water in headpools and spring outflow streams; presence of a stable, natural substrate supporting food plants for the fish; and length of outflow streams; adequate for seasonal movements in response to changes of water temperature.

Laurel Dace (*Chrosomus saylori*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Bledsoe, Rhea, and Sequatchie Counties, Tennessee, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the laurel dace consist of five components:

(i) Pool and run habitats of geomorphically stable, first- to second-order streams with riparian vegetation; cool, clean, flowing water; shallow depths; and connectivity between spawning, foraging, and resting sites to promote gene flow throughout the species' range.

(ii) Stable bottom substrates composed of relatively silt-free gravel, cobble, and slab-rock boulder substrates with undercut banks and canopy cover. Relatively silt-free is defined for the purpose of this rule as silt or fine sand within interstitial spaces of substrates in amounts low enough to have minimal impact to the species.

(iii) An instream flow regime (magnitude, frequency, duration, and seasonality of discharge over time) sufficient to provide permanent surface flows, as measured during years with average rainfall, and to maintain benthic habitats utilized by the species.

(iv) Adequate water quality characterized by moderate stream temperatures, acceptable dissolved oxygen concentrations, moderate pH, and low levels of pollutants. Adequate water quality is defined for the purpose of this rule as the quality necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages of the laurel dace.

Constituent elements, for all areas designated as critical habitat, consist of medium-sized creeks with silt-free pools and riffles and moderately clear water draining hilly areas underlain by chert and dolomite. Water ranges from 8 to 46 inches in depth over gravel with scattered rubble.

Rush Darter (*Etheostoma phytophilum*)

(1) The critical habitat units are depicted for Jefferson, Winston, and Etowah Counties in Alabama, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the rush darter consist of five components:

(i) Springs and spring-fed reaches of geomorphically stable, relatively low-gradient, headwater streams with appropriate habitat (bottom substrates) to maintain essential riffles, runs, and pools; emergent vegetation in shallow water and on the margins of small streams and spring runs; cool, clean, flowing water; and connectivity between spawning, foraging, and resting sites to promote gene flow throughout the species' range.

(ii) Stable bottom substrates consisting of a combination of sand with silt, muck, gravel, or bedrock and adequate emergent vegetation in shallow water on the margins of small permanent and ephemeral streams and spring runs.

(iii) Instream flow with moderate velocity and a continuous daily discharge that allows for a longitudinal connectivity regime inclusive of both surface runoff and groundwater sources (springs and seepages) and exclusive of flushing flows caused by stormwater runoff.

(iv) Water quality with temperature not exceeding 26.7 °C (80 °F), dissolved oxygen 6.0 milligrams or greater per liter (mg/L), turbidity of an average monthly reading of 10 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU; units used to measure sediment discharge) and 15 mg/L total suspended solids (TSS; measured as mg/L of sediment in water) or less; and a specific conductance (ability of water to conduct an electric current, based on dissolved solids in the water) of no greater than 225 micro Siemens per centimeter at 26.7 °C (80 °F).

(v) Prey base of aquatic macroinvertebrates, including midge larvae, mayfly nymphs, blackfly larvae, beetles, and microcrustaceans.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on November 15, 2012.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS digital ortho-photo quarter-quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 16N, NAD1983, coordinates. Upstream and downstream limits were then identified by longitude and latitude using decimal degrees and projected in WGS 1984. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the field office Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/cookeville*), *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2011-0074, and at the Service's Tennessee Fish and Wildlife Office. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

Citico Creek from the Cherokee National Forest boundary at upper Citico Bridge on Mountain Settlement Road (approximately creek mile 4.3) upstream to the confluence of Citico Creek with Barkcamp Branch (approximately creek mile 10.8).

Constituent elements of the critical habitat include the present good water quality in Citico Creek and run/pool areas with relatively silt-free pea-size gravel substrate containing scattered large flat rocks for breeding habitat. The species utilizes palm-size slab rocks for cover and relatively silt-free riffle areas during other times of the year. The area designated as critical habitat provides the smoky madtom with all of the necessary constituent elements for completion of its life cycle.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Val Verde County and Kinney County, Texas, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Devils River minnow are the following habitat components:

(i) Streams characterized by:

(A) Areas with slow to moderate water velocities between 10 and 40 cm/second (4 and 16 in/second) in shallow to moderate water depths between approximately 10 cm (4 in) and 1.5 m (4.9 ft), near vegetative structure, such as emergent or submerged vegetation or stream bank riparian vegetation that overhangs into the water column;

(B) Gravel and cobble substrates ranging in diameter between 2 and 10 cm (0.8 and 4 in) with low or moderate amounts of fine sediment (less than 65 percent stream bottom coverage) and low or moderate amounts of substrate embeddedness; and

(C) Pool, riffle, run, and backwater components free of artificial instream structures that would prevent movement of fish upstream or downstream.

(ii) High-quality water provided by permanent, natural flows from groundwater spring and seeps characterized by:

(A) Temperature ranging between 17 °C and 29 °C (63 °F and 84 °F);

(B) Dissolved oxygen levels greater than 5.0 mg/l;

(C) Neutral pH ranging between 7.0 and 8.2;

(D) Conductivity less than 0.7 mS/cm and salinity less than 1 ppt;

(E) Ammonia levels less than 0.4 mg/l; and

(F) No or minimal pollutant levels for copper, arsenic, mercury, and cadmium; human and animal waste products; pesticides; fertilizers; suspended sediments; and petroleum compounds and gasoline or diesel fuels.

(iii) An abundant aquatic food base consisting of algae attached to stream substrates and other microorganisms associated with stream substrates.

(iv) Aquatic stream habitat either devoid of nonnative aquatic species (including fish, plants, and invertebrates) or in which such nonnative aquatic species are at levels that allow for healthy populations of Devils River minnows.

(v) Areas within stream courses that may be periodically dewatered for short time periods, during seasonal droughts, but otherwise serve as connective corridors between occupied or seasonally occupied areas through which the species moves when the area is wetted.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created in ArcGIS using the National Hydrography Dataset and 7.5' topographic quadrangle maps obtained from U.S. Geological Survey to approximate stream channels and calculate distances (stream km and stream mi). We made some minor adjustments to stream channels using the 2004 National Agriculture Imagery Program digital orthophotos obtained from the Texas Natural Resources Information System. For each critical habitat unit, the upstream and downstream boundaries are described as paired geographic coordinates X, Y (meters E, meters N, UTM Zone 14, referenced to North American Horizontal Datum 1983). Additionally, critical habitat areas include the stream channels within the identified stream reaches and areas within these reaches up to the bankfull width.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Apache, Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Pinal, and Yavapai Counties, Arizona, and for Catron, Grant, and Hidalgo Counties, New Mexico, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements (PCE) of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of loach minnow consist of six components:

(i) Habitat to support all egg, larval, juvenile, and adult loach minnow. This habitat includes perennial flows with a stream depth of generally less than 1 m (3.3 ft), and with slow to swift flow velocities between 0 and 80 cm per second (0.0 and 31.5 in. per second). Appropriate microhabitat types include pools, runs, riffles, and rapids over sand, gravel, cobble, and rubble substrates with low or moderate amounts of fine sediment and substrate embeddedness. Appropriate habitats have a low stream gradient of less than 2.5 percent and are at elevations below 2,500 m (8,202 ft). Water temperatures should be in the general range of 8.0 to 25.0 °C (46.4 to 77 °F).

(ii) An abundant aquatic insect food base consisting of mayflies, true flies, black flies, caddis flies, stoneflies, and dragonflies.

(iii) Streams with no or no more than low levels of pollutants.

(iv) Perennial flows or interrupted stream courses that are periodically dewatered but that serve as connective corridors between occupied or seasonally occupied habitat and through which the species may move when the habitat is wetted.

(v) No nonnative aquatic species, or levels of nonnative aquatic species that are sufficiently low to allow persistence of loach minnow.

(vi) Streams with a natural, unregulated flow regime that allows for periodic flooding or, if flows are modified or regulated, a flow regime that allows for adequate river functions, such as flows capable of transporting sediments.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule. We have determined that all designated areas contain at least one PCE for loach minnow.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles along with shapefiles generated by the Arizona Land Resource Information Service for land ownership, streams, counties, and the Public Land Survey System. Information on species locations was derived from databases developed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, and Arizona State University.

(1) Designated critical habitat is depicted for Socorro, Valencia, Bernalillo, and Sandoval Counties, New Mexico, on the map and as described below. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) For each river reach, the upstream and downstream boundaries are described below. Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the identified river reaches and areas within these reaches included within the existing levees, or if no levees are present, then within a lateral distance of 300 ft (91.4 m) on each side of the river width at bankfull stage. Bankfull stage is the flow at which water begins to leave the channel and move into the floodplain. The bankfull stage is not defined by water, and can be determined by visual or physical indicators, including: The top of the highest depositional features (e.g., point bars), staining of rocks, exposed root hairs, and other features.

(3) Within these areas the primary constituent elements include, but are not limited to, those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, and reproduction. These elements include the following:

(i) A hydrologic regime that provides sufficient flowing water with low to moderate currents capable of forming and maintaining a diversity of aquatic habitats, such as, but not limited to the following: Backwaters (a body of water connected to the main channel, but with no appreciable flow), shallow side channels, pools (that portion of the river that is deep with relatively little velocity compared to the rest of the channel), eddies (a pool with water moving opposite to that in the river channel), and runs (flowing water in the river channel without obstructions) of varying depth and velocity - all of which are necessary for each of the particular silvery minnow life-history stages in appropriate seasons (e.g., the silvery minnow requires habitat with sufficient flows from early spring (March) to early summer (June) to trigger spawning, flows in the summer (June) and fall (October) that do not increase prolonged periods of low or no flow, and a relatively constant winter flow (November through February));

(ii) The presence of eddies created by debris piles, pools, or backwaters, or other refuge habitat (e.g., connected oxbows or braided channels) within unimpounded stretches of flowing water of sufficient length (*i.e.,* river miles) that provide a variation of habitats with a wide range of depth and velocities;

(iii) Substrates of predominantly sand or silt; and

(iv) Water of sufficient quality to maintain natural, daily, and seasonally variable water temperatures in the approximate range of greater than 1 °C (35 °F) and less than 30 °C (85 °F) and reduce degraded conditions (e.g., decreased dissolved oxygen, increased pH).

(4) The Pueblo lands of Santo Domingo, Santa Ana, Sandia, and Isleta are not designated.

(5) Designated critical habitat is depicted on the following map for the middle Rio Grande, which includes the area from Cochiti Reservoir downstream to the utility line crossing the Rio Grande just east of the Bosque Well as demarcated on USGS Paraje Well 7.5 minute quadrangle (1980), with the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates of UTM Zone 13: 311474 E, 3719722 N (as referenced with the 1927 North American Datum (NAD27)), Sandoval, Bernalillo, Valencia, and Socorro Counties, New Mexico. The designation also includes the upper section of the tributary Jemez River from Jemez Canyon Dam to the upstream boundary of Santa Ana Pueblo, Sandoval County. The river reaches in the middle Rio Grande include:

(i) Jemez Canyon Reach - 1 mi (1.6 km) of the Jemez River immediately downstream of Jemez Canyon Dam to the upstream boundary Santa Ana Pueblo;

(ii) Cochiti Diversion Dam to Angostura Diversion Dam (Cochiti Reach) - 21 mi (34 km) of river immediately downstream of Cochiti Reservoir to the Angostura Diversion Dam;

(iii) Angostura Diversion Dam to Isleta Diversion Dam (Angostura Reach) - 38 mi (61 km) of river immediately downstream of the Angostura Diversion Dam to the Isleta Diversion Dam;

(iv) Isleta Diversion Dam to San Acacia Diversion Dam (Isleta Reach) - 56 mi (90 km) of river immediately downstream of the Isleta Diversion Dam to the San Acacia Diversion Dam; and

(v) San Acacia Diversion Dam to the Elephant Butte Dam (San Acacia Reach) - 92 mi (147 km) of river immediately downstream of the San Acacia Diversion Dam to the utility line crossing the Rio Grande just east of the Bosque Well demarcated on USGS Paraje Well 7.5 minute quadrangle (1980) with UTM coordinates of UTM Zone 13: 311474 E, 3719722 N.

Pursuant to section 4(b)(2) of the Act, we have excluded all areas determined to meet the definition of critical habitat under section 3(5)(a) of the Act for the grotto sculpin. Therefore, no specific areas are designated as critical habitat for this species.

Arkansas River Shiner (*Notropis girardi*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Clark, Comanche, Meade, and Seward Counties, Kansas; and Beaver, Blaine, Caddo, Canadian, Cleveland, Custer, Grady, Harper, Hughes, Kingfisher, Logan, Major, McClain, McIntosh, Pittsburg, Pontotoc, Pottawatomie, Seminole, Woods and Woodward Counties, Oklahoma, on the maps and as described below.

(2) Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the identified stream reaches indicated on the map below, and includes a lateral distance of 91.4 m (300 ft) on each side of the stream width at bankfull discharge. Bankfull discharge is the flow at which water begins to leave the channel and move into the floodplain and generally occurs with a frequency of every 1 to 2 years.

(3) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements include, but are not limited to, those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, and reproduction. These elements include the following - (i) a natural, unregulated hydrologic regime complete with episodes of flood and drought or, if flows are modified or regulated, a hydrologic regime characterized by the duration, magnitude, and frequency of flow events capable of forming and maintaining channel and instream habitat necessary for particular Arkansas River shiner life-stages in appropriate seasons; (ii) a complex, braided channel with pool, riffle (shallow area in a streambed causing ripples), run, and backwater components that provide a suitable variety of depths and current velocities in appropriate seasons; (iii) a suitable unimpounded stretch of flowing water of sufficient length to allow hatching and development of the larvae; (iv) a river bed of predominantly sand, with some patches of gravel and cobble; (v) water quality characterized by low concentrations of contaminants and natural, daily and seasonally variable temperature, turbidity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH; (vi) suitable reaches of aquatic habitat, as defined by primary constituent elements (i) through (v) above, and adjacent riparian habitat sufficient to support an abundant terrestrial, semiaquatic, and aquatic invertebrate food base; and (vii) few or no predatory or competitive non-native fish species present.

(4) Developed areas, such as buildings, roads, bridges, parking lots, railroad tracks, other paved areas, and the lands that support these features are excluded from this designation. They are not designated as critical habitat and Federal actions limited to these areas would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they affect protected or restricted habitat and one or more of the primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(5) Kansas (Sixth Principal Meridian (SPM)) and Oklahoma (Indian Meridian (IM)): Areas of land and water as follows (physical features were identified using USGS 7.5′ quadrangle maps; river reach distances were derived from digital data obtained from USGS National Atlas data set for river reaches, roads, and county boundaries.

Topeka Shiner (*Notropis topeka*)

(1) Critical habitat is depicted for Calhoun, Carroll, Dallas, Greene, Hamilton, Lyon, Osceola, Sac, Webster, and Wright Counties, Iowa; Lincoln, Murray, Nobles, Pipestone, and Rock Counties, Minnesota; and Madison County, Nebraska, on the maps and as described below.

(2) Critical habitat includes all stream channels up to the bankfull discharge elevation. Additionally, in Iowa and Minnesota, the off-channel, side-channel, and oxbow pools at elevations at or below the bankfull discharge elevation. Bankfull discharge is the flow at which water begins to leave the channel and move into the floodplain and generally occurs with a frequency of every 1 to 2 years.

(3) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Topeka shiner consist of:

(i) Streams most often with permanent flow, but that can become intermittent during dry periods;

(ii) Side-channel pools and oxbows either seasonally connected to a stream or maintained by groundwater inputs, at a surface elevation equal to or lower than the bank-full discharge stream elevation. The bankfull discharge is the flow at which water begins leaving the channel and flowing into the floodplain; this level is generally attained every 1 to 2 years. Bankfull discharge, while a function of the size of the stream, is a fairly constant feature related to the formation, maintenance, and dimensions of the stream channel;

(iii) Streams and side-channel pools with water quality necessary for unimpaired behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages. (The water quality components include - temperature, turbidity, conductivity, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, chemical contaminants, and other chemical characteristics.);

(iv) Living and spawning areas for adult Topeka shiner with pools or runs with water velocities less than 0.5 meters/second (approx. 20 inches/second) and depths ranging from 0.1-2.0 meters (approx. 4-80 inches);

(v) Living areas for juvenile Topeka shiner with water velocities less than 0.5 meters/second (approx. 20 inches/second) with depths less than 0.25 meters (approx. 10 inches) and moderate amounts of instream aquatic cover, such as woody debris, overhanging terrestrial vegetation, and aquatic plants;

(vi) Sand, gravel, cobble, and silt substrates with amounts of fine sediment and substrate embeddedness that allow for nest building and maintenance of nests and eggs by native *Lepomis* sunfishes (green sunfish, orangespotted sunfish, longear sunfish) and Topeka shiner as necessary for reproduction, unimpaired behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages;

(vii) An adequate terrestrial, semiaquatic, and aquatic invertebrate food base that allows for unimpaired growth, reproduction, and survival of all life stages;

(viii) A hydrologic regime capable of forming, maintaining, or restoring the flow periodicity, channel morphology, fish community composition, off-channel habitats, and habitat components described in the other primary constituent elements; and

(ix) Few or no nonnative predatory or nonnative competitive species present.

Primary Constituent Elements - physical habitat, water, river flow, and salinity concentrations required to maintain delta smelt habitat for spawning, larval and juvenile transport, rearing, and adult migration.

Spikedace (*Meda fulgida*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee, Pinal, and Yavapai Counties, Arizona, and for Catron, Grant, and Hidalgo Counties, New Mexico, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements (PCE) of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of spikedace consist of six components:

(i) Habitat to support all egg, larval, juvenile, and adult spikedace. This habitat includes perennial flows with a stream depth generally less than 1 m (3.3 ft), and with slow to swift flow velocities between 5 and 80 cm per second (1.9 and 31.5 in. per second). Appropriate stream microhabitat types include glides, runs, riffles, the margins of pools and eddies, and backwater components over sand, gravel, and cobble substrates with low or moderate amounts of fine sediment and substrate embeddedness. Appropriate habitat will have a low gradient of less than approximately 1.0 percent, at elevations below 2,100 m (6,890 ft). Water temperatures should be in the general range of 8.0 to 28.0 °C (46.4 to 82.4 °F).

(ii) An abundant aquatic insect food base consisting of mayflies, true flies, black flies, caddis flies, stoneflies, and dragonflies.

(iii) Streams with no or no more than low levels of pollutants.

(iv) Perennial flows, or interrupted stream courses that are periodically dewatered but that serve as connective corridors between occupied or seasonally occupied habitat and through which the species may move when the habitat is wetted.

(v) No nonnative aquatic species, or levels of nonnative aquatic species that are sufficiently low as to allow persistence of spikedace.

(vi) Streams with a natural, unregulated flow regime that allows for periodic flooding or, if flows are modified or regulated, a flow regime that allows for adequate river functions, such as flows capable of transporting sediments.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule. We have determined that all designated areas contain at least one PCE for spikedace.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles along with shapefiles generated by the Arizona Land Resource Information Service for land ownership, streams, counties, and the Public Land Survey System. Information on species locations was derived from databases developed by the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, and Arizona State University.

![](/graphics/ec01jn91.138.gif)Alabama Sturgeon (*Scaphirhynchus suttkusi*)

(1) Critical habitat unit is depicted for Baldwin, Monroe, Wilcox, Clarke, Dallas, Lowndes, Autauga, Bibb, and Perry Counties, Alabama, on the map below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Alabama sturgeon are:

(i) A flow regime (*i.e.,* the magnitude, frequency, duration, seasonality of discharge over time) necessary to maintain all life stages of the species in the riverine environment, including migration, breeding site selection, resting, larval development, and protection of cool water refuges (*i.e.,* tributaries).

(ii) River channel with stable sand and gravel river bottoms, and bedrock walls, including associated mussel beds.

(iii) Limestone outcrops and cut limestone banks, large gravel or cobble such as that found around channel training devices, and bedrock channel walls that provide riverine spawning sites with substrates suitable for embryo deposition and development.

(iv) Long sections of free-flowing water to allow spawning migrations and development of embryos and larvae.

(v) Water temperature not exceeding 32 °Celsius (90 °Fahrenheit); dissolved oxygen levels not less than 5 milligrams per liter (mg/L) (5 parts per million (ppm)), except under extreme conditions due to natural causes or downstream of existing hydroelectric impoundments, where it can range from 5 mg/L to 4 mg/L (5 ppm to 4 ppm); and pH within the range of 6.0 to 8.5.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, docks, dams, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land or waterway on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) Critical habitat map unit. Data layers defining the map unit were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles, and the critical habitat unit was then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

(5) Unit: Alabama and Cahaba Rivers; Baldwin, Monroe, Wilcox, Clarke, Dallas, Lowndes, Autauga, Perry, and Bibb Counties, Alabama.

(i) The unit encompasses 524 km (326 mi) of river channel. The portion of river channel in the Alabama River extends 394 km (245 mi) from its confluence with the Tombigbee River, Baldwin and Clarke Counties, Alabama, upstream to R.F. Henry Lock and Dam, Autauga and Lowndes Counties, Alabama; and the portion of river channel in the Cahaba River extends 130 km (81 mi) from its confluence with the Alabama River, Dallas County, Alabama, upstream to U.S. Highway 82, Bibb County, Alabama.

![](/graphics/er02jn09.011.gif)Gulf Sturgeon (*Acipenser oxyrinchus desotoi*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements essential for the conservation of Gulf sturgeon are those habitat components that support feeding, resting, and sheltering, reproduction, migration, and physical features necessary for maintaining the natural processes that support these habitat components. The primary constituent elements include:

(i) Abundant prey items within riverine habitats for larval and juvenile life stages, and within estuarine and marine habitats and substrates for juvenile, subadult, and adult life stages;

(ii) Riverine spawning sites with substrates suitable for egg deposition and development, such as limestone outcrops and cut limestone banks, bedrock, large gravel or cobble beds, marl, soapstone or hard clay;

(iii) Riverine aggregation areas, also referred to as resting, holding, and staging areas, used by adult, subadult, and/or juveniles, generally, but not always, located in holes below normal riverbed depths, believed necessary for minimizing energy expenditures during fresh water residency and possibly for osmoregulatory functions;

(iv) A flow regime (*i.e,.* the magnitude, frequency, duration, seasonality, and rate-of-change of fresh water discharge over time) necessary for normal behavior, growth, and survival of all life stages in the riverine environment, including migration, breeding site selection, courtship, egg fertilization, resting, and staging; and necessary for maintaining spawning sites in suitable condition for egg attachment, egg sheltering, resting, and larvae staging;

(v) Water quality, including temperature, salinity, pH, hardness, turbidity, oxygen content, and other chemical characteristics, necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages;

(vi) Sediment quality, including texture and other chemical characteristics, necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages; and

(vii) Safe and unobstructed migratory pathways necessary for passage within and between riverine, estuarine, and marine habitats (e.g., a river unobstructed by any permanent structure, or a dammed river that still allows for passage).

(3) Gulf sturgeon is under the joint jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). The FWS will maintain primary responsibility for recovery actions and NMFS will assist in and continue to fund recovery actions pertaining to estuarine and marine habitats. In riverine units, the FWS will be responsible for all consultations regarding Gulf sturgeon and critical habitat. In estuarine units, we will divide responsibility based on the action agency involved. The FWS will consult with the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. NMFS will consult with the Department of Defense, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Minerals Management Service and any other Federal agencies not mentioned here explicitly. In marine units, NMFS will be responsible for all consultations regarding Gulf sturgeon and critical habitat. Any Federal projects that extend into the jurisdiction of both the Services will be consulted on by the FWS with internal coordination with NMFS. Each agency will conduct its own intra-agency consultations as necessary.

Although the interface of fresh and saltwater, referred to as the saltwater wedge, occurs within the lower-most reach of a river, for ease in delineating critical habitat units, we are defining the boundary between the riverine and estuarine units as rkm 0 (rmi 0).

(iii) Regulatory jurisdiction in coastal areas extends to the line on the shore reached by the plane of the mean (average) high water (MHW) (33 CFR 329.12(a)(2)). All bays and estuaries within Units 8 to 14 therefore, lie below the MHW lines. Where precise determination of the actual location becomes necessary, it must be established by survey with reference to the available tidal datum, preferably averaged over a period of 18.6 years. Less precise methods, such as observation of the “apparent shoreline” which is determined by reference to physical markings, lines of vegetation, may be used only where an estimate is needed of the line reached by the mean high water.

(iv) The term 72 COLREGS is defined as demarcation lines which delineate those waters upon which mariners shall comply with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 and those waters upon which mariners shall comply with the Inland Navigation Rules (33 CFR 80.01). The waters inside of these lines are Inland Rules waters and the waters outside the lines are COLREGS waters. These lines are defined in 33 CFR 80, and have been used for identification purposes to delineate boundary lines of the estuarine and marine habitat Units 8, 9, 11, and 12.

(20) Critical habitat does not include existing developed sites such as dams, piers, marinas, bridges, boat ramps, exposed oil and gas pipelines, oil rigs, and similar structures or designated public swimming areas.

White Sturgeon (*Acipenser transmontanus*); Kootenai River Population

(1) Critical habitat is designated in Idaho, Boundary County, on the Kootenai River from river mile (RM) 141.4 (river kilometer (RKM) 228) to RM 159.7 (RKM 257), as indicated on the map in paragraph (3) of this entry, from ordinary high-water mark to opposite bank ordinary high-water mark as defined in 33 CFR 329.11.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Kootenai River population of the white sturgeon are:

(i) A flow regime, during the spawning season of May through June, that approximates natural variable conditions and is capable of producing depths of 23 feet (ft) (7 meters (m)) or greater when natural conditions (for example, weather patterns, water year) allow. The depths must occur at multiple sites throughout, but not uniformly within, the Kootenai River designated critical habitat.

(ii) A flow regime, during the spawning season of May through June, that approximates natural variable conditions and is capable of producing mean water column velocities of 3.3 feet per second (ft/s) (1.0 meters per second (m/s)) or greater when natural conditions (for example, weather patterns, water year) allow. The velocities must occur at multiple sites throughout, but not uniformly within, the Kootenai River designated critical habitat.

(iii) During the spawning season of May through June, water temperatures between 47.3 and 53.6 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) (8.5 and 12 degrees Celsius (°C)), with no more than a 3.6 °F (2.1 °C) fluctuation in temperature within a 24-hour period, as measured at Bonners Ferry.

(iv) Submerged rocky substrates in approximately 5 continuous river miles (8 river kilometers) to provide for natural free embryo redistribution behavior and downstream movement.

(v) A flow regime that limits sediment deposition and maintains appropriate rocky substrate and inter-gravel spaces for sturgeon egg adhesion, incubation, escape cover, and free embryo development.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Klamath and Lake Counties, Oregon, and Modoc County, California, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Lost River sucker consist of three components:

(i) *Water.* Areas with sufficient water quantity and depth within lakes, reservoirs, streams, marshes, springs, groundwater sources, and refugia habitats with minimal physical, biological, or chemical impediments to connectivity. Water must have varied depths to accommodate each life stage: Shallow water (up to 3.28 ft (1.0 m)) for larval life stage, and deeper water (up to 14.8 ft (4.5 m)) for older life stages. The water quality characteristics should include water temperatures of less than 82.4 °Fahrenheit (28.0 °Celsius); pH less than 9.75; dissolved oxygen levels greater than 4.0 mg per L; low levels of microcystin; and un-ionized ammonia (less than 0.5 mg per L). Elements also include natural flow regimes that provide flows during the appropriate time of year or, if flows are controlled, minimal flow departure from a natural hydrograph.

(ii) *Spawning and rearing habitat.* Streams and shoreline springs with gravel and cobble substrate at depths typically less than 4.3 ft (1.3 m) with adequate stream velocity to allow spawning to occur. Areas containing emergent vegetation adjacent to open water, provides habitat for rearing and facilitates growth and survival of suckers, as well as protection from predation and protection from currents and turbulence.

(iii) *Food.* Areas that contain an abundant forage base, including a broad array of chironomidae, crustacea, and other aquatic macroinvertebrates.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as docks and bridges) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on January 10, 2013.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of the U.S. Geological Survey 2009 National Hydrography Dataset, and critical habitat was then mapped using North American Datum (NAD) 83, Universal Transverse Mercator Zone 10N coordinates. The maps in this entry establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation.

Constituent elements of all areas proposed as critical habitat include streams 15 feet to 60 feet wide with gravel-bottom shoal and riffle areas with intervening pools. Streams should have clean, unpolluted flowing water and a stable riparian zone. The streams should support a variety of aquatic insects, crustaceans, and other small invertebrates for food.

Zuni bluehead sucker (Catostomus discobolus yarrowi)

(1) Critical habitat unit is depicted for Cibola and McKinley Counties, New Mexico, on the map below.

(2) Critical habitat includes the adjacent floodplains within 91.4 lateral meters (m) (300 lateral feet (ft)) on either side of bankfull discharge, except where bounded by canyon walls. Bankfull discharge is the flow at which water begins to leave the channel and disperse into the floodplain, and generally occurs every 1 to 2 years.

(3) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Zuni bluehead sucker consist of three components:

(i) A riverine system with habitat to support all life stages of the Zuni bluehead sucker, which includes:

(A) Dynamic flows that allow for periodic changes in channel morphology and adequate river functions, such as channel reshaping and delivery of coarse sediments.

(B) Stream courses with perennial flows or intermittent flows that serve as connective corridors between occupied or seasonally occupied habitat through which the subspecies may disperse when the habitat is wetted.

(C) Stream mesohabitat types including runs, riffles, and pools with substrate ranging from gravel, cobble, and bedrock substrates with low or moderate amounts of fine sediment and substrate embeddedness.

(D) Streams with depths generally less than 2 meters (3.3 feet), and with slow to swift flow velocities less than 0.35 meters per second (1.15 feet per second).

(E) Clear, cool water with low turbidity and temperatures in the general range of 2.0 to 23.0 °C (35.6 to 73.4 °F).

(F) No harmful levels of pollutants.

(G) Adequate riparian shading to reduce water temperatures when ambient temperatures are high and provide protective cover from predators.

(ii) An abundant aquatic insect food base consisting of fine particulate organic material, filamentous algae, midge larvae, caddisfly larvae, mayfly larvae, flatworms, and small terrestrial insects.

(iii) Areas devoid of nonnative aquatic species or areas that are maintained to keep nonnatives at a level that allows the Zuni bluehead sucker to continue to survive and reproduce.

(4) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on July 7, 2016.

(5) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map unit were developed using ESRI ArcGIS mapping software along with various spatial layers. Data layers defining map units were created with U.S. Geological Survey National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Medium Flowline data. ArcGIS was also used to calculate river kilometers and river miles from the NHD dataset, and it was used to determine longitude and latitude coordinates in decimal degrees. Critical habitat upstream limits were delineated based on the upper limits identified in the NHD dataset for each stream. The projection used in mapping and calculating distances and locations within the unit was North American Equidistant Conic, NAD 83. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/newmexico*), at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2013-0002, and at the field office responsible for this designation.

(2) *Topographic features included in the critical habitat designation.* Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the designated stream reaches; designated lakes and reservoirs; and inshore portions of marine nearshore areas, including tidally influenced freshwater heads of estuaries indicated on the maps beginning with paragraph (e)(7) of this entry.

(i) Critical habitat includes the stream channels within the designated stream reaches and a lateral extent as defined by the bankfull elevation on one bank to the bankfull elevation on the opposite bank. Bankfull elevation is the level at which water begins to leave the channel and move into the floodplain and is reached at a discharge that generally has a recurrence interval of 1 to 2 years on the annual flood series. If bankfull elevation is not evident on either bank, the ordinary high-water line must be used to determine the lateral extent of critical habitat. The lateral extent of designated lakes is defined by the perimeter of the waterbody as mapped on standard 1:24,000 scale topographic maps.

(ii) Critical habitat includes the inshore extent of critical habitat for marine nearshore areas (the mean higher high-water (MHHW) line), including the uppermost reach of the saltwater wedge within tidally influenced freshwater heads of estuaries. The MHHW line refers to the average of all the higher high-water heights of the two daily tidal levels. Adjacent shoreline riparian areas, bluffs, and uplands are not designated as critical habitat. However, it should be recognized that the quality of marine habitat along shorelines is intrinsically related to the character of these adjacent features, and human activities that occur outside of the MHHW line can have major effects on the physical and biological features of the marine environment. The offshore extent of critical habitat for marine nearshore areas is based on the extent of the photic zone, which is the layer of water in which organisms are exposed to light. Critical habitat extends offshore to the depth of 10 meters (m) (33 feet (ft)) relative to the mean low low-water (MLLW) line (average of all the lower low-water heights of the two daily tidal levels). This equates to the average depth of the photic zone and is consistent with the offshore extent of the nearshore habitat identified by the national Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the National Tidal Datum 1983 through 2001. This area between the MHHW line and minus 10 m MLLW line is considered the habitat most consistently used by bull trout in marine waters based on known use, forage fish availability, and ongoing migration studies and captures geological and ecological processes important to maintaining these habitats. This area contains essential foraging habitat and migration corridors such as estuaries, bays, inlets, shallow subtidal areas, and intertidal flats.

(3) *The primary constituent elements (PCEs) of critical habitat.* Within the critical habitat, the PCEs for bull trout are those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of foraging, reproducing, rearing of young, dispersal, genetic exchange, or sheltering. The PCEs are as follows:

(i) Springs, seeps, groundwater sources, and subsurface water connectivity (hyporheic flows) to contribute to water quality and quantity and provide thermal refugia.

(ii) Migration habitats with minimal physical, biological, or water quality impediments between spawning, rearing, overwintering, and freshwater and marine foraging habitats, including but not limited to permanent, partial, intermittent, or seasonal barriers.

(iii) An abundant food base, including terrestrial organisms of riparian origin, aquatic macroinvertebrates, and forage fish.

(iv) Complex river, stream, lake, reservoir, and marine shoreline aquatic environments, and processes that establish and maintain these aquatic environments, with features such as large wood, side channels, pools, undercut banks and unembedded substrates, to provide a variety of depths, gradients, velocities, and structure.

(v) Water temperatures ranging from 2 to 15 degrees Celsius (°C) (36 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit (°F)), with adequate thermal refugia available for temperatures that exceed the upper end of this range. Specific temperatures within this range will depend on bull trout life-history stage and form; geography; elevation; diurnal and seasonal variation; shading, such as that provided by riparian habitat; streamflow; and local groundwater influence.

(vi) In spawning and rearing areas, substrate of sufficient amount, size, and composition to ensure success of egg and embryo overwinter survival, fry emergence, and young-of-the-year and juvenile survival. A minimal amount of fine sediment, generally ranging in size from silt to coarse sand, embedded in larger substrates, is characteristic of these conditions. The size and amounts of fine sediment suitable to bull trout will likely vary from system to system.

(vii) A natural hydrograph, including peak, high, low, and base flows within historic and seasonal ranges or, if flows are controlled, minimal flow departure from a natural hydrograph.

(viii) Sufficient water quality and quantity such that normal reproduction, growth, and survival are not inhibited.

(ix) Sufficiently low levels of occurrence of nonnative predatory (e.g., lake trout, walleye, northern pike, smallmouth bass); interbreeding (e.g., brook trout); or competing (e.g., brown trout) species that, if present, are adequately temporally and spatially isolated from bull trout.

(4) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (including, but not limited to, buildings, aqueducts, docks, seawalls, pipelines, roads, runways, or other structures or paved areas) and the land or waterway on which they are located that exist within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(5) *Exclusions.* Each excluded area is identified in the relevant Critical Habitat Unit text below, as identified in paragraphs (e)(8) through (e)(41) of this entry. Critical habitat does not include:

(i) Waters adjacent to non-Federal lands covered by the following legally operative incidental take permits for habitat conservation plans (HCPs) issued under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), in which bull trout is a covered species on or before the publication of this final rule: Cedar River Watershed HCP, Green Diamond HCP, Washington Department of Natural Resources HCP, Washington Forest Practices HCP, Plum Creek Central Cascades HCP, Plum Creek Native Fish HCP, and Stimpson Native Fish HCP;

(ii) Waters within or adjacent to lands subject to certain tribal management plans; or

(iii) Waters where impacts to national security have been identified.

(6) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Hydrologic Unit Code map (HUCs) at a scale of 1:250,000 down to the 4th level cataloging unit. In some cases, 5th and 6th level HUCs were also used and some finer scale watersheds developed using USGS 10-meter Digital Elevation Model and 1:24,000 scale hydrography layers. The marine boundaries for the Puget Sound and Olympic Peninsula critical habitat unit were based on Washington Department of Natural Resources 1:24,000 scale county boundaries and HUCs.

Legal descriptions for St. George (Utah-Arizona) and Littlefield (Arizona) were obtained from the 1987 BLM maps (Surface Management Status 30 × 60 Minute Quadrangles). Legal descriptions for Overton (Nevada-Arizona) were obtained from the 1989 BLM maps (Surface Management Status 30 × 60 Minute Quadrangles). The 100-year floodplain for many areas is detailed in Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) published by and available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In areas where a FIRM is not available, the presence of alluvium soils or known high water marks can be used to determine the extent of the floodplain. Only areas of floodplain containing at least one of the constituent elements are considered critical habitat. Critical habitat designated for the woundfin is as follows:

Utah, Washington County; Arizona, Mohave County; Nevada, Clark County. The Virgin River and its 100-year floodplain from its confluence with La Verkin Creek, Utah in T.41S., R.13W., sec.23 (Salt Lake Base and Meridian) to Halfway Wash, Nevada T.15S., R.69E., sec.6 (Salt Lake Base and Meridian).

The primary constituent elements of critical habitat determined necessary for the survival and recovery of these Virgin River fishes are water, physical habitat, and biological environment. The desired conditions for each of these elements are further discussed below.

Water - A sufficient quantity and quality of water (*i.e.,* temperature, dissolved oxygen, contaminants, nutrients, turbidity, etc.) that is delivered to a specific location in accordance with a hydrologic regime that is identified for the particular life stage for each species. This includes the following:

1. Water quality characterized by natural seasonally variable temperature, turbidity, and conductivity;

2. Hydrologic regime characterized by the duration, magnitude, and frequency of flow events capable of forming and maintaining channel and instream habitat necessary for particular life stages at certain times of the year; and

3. Flood events inundating the floodplain necessary to provide the organic matter that provides or supports the nutrient and food sources for the listed fishes.

Physical Habitat - Areas of the Virgin River that are inhabited or potentially habitable by a particular life stage for each species, for use in spawning, nursing, feeding, and rearing, or corridors between such areas:

1. River channels, side channels, secondary channels, backwaters, and springs, and other areas which provide access to these habitats;

2. Areas inhabited by adult and juvenile woundfin include runs and pools adjacent to riffles that have sand and sand/gravel substrates;

3. Areas inhabited by juvenile woundfin are generally deeper and slower. When turbidity is low, adults also tend to occupy deeper and slower habitats;

4. Areas inhabited by woundfin larvae include shoreline margins and backwater habitats associated with growths of filamentous algae.

Biological Environment - Food supply, predation, and competition are important elements of the biological environment and are considered components of this constituent element. Food supply is a function of nutrient supply, productivity, and availability to each life stage of the species. Predation and competition, although considered normal components of this environment, are out of balance due to nonnative fish species in many areas. Fourteen introduced species, including red shiner (*Cyprinella lutrensis*), black bullhead (*Ameiurus melas*), channel catfish (*Ictalurus punctatus*), and largemouth bass (*Micropterus salmoides*), compete with or prey upon the listed fishes. Of these, the red shiner is the most numerous and has been the most problematic for the listed fishes. Red shiners compete for food and available habitats and are known to prey on the eggs and early life stages of the listed fishes. Components of this constituent element include the following:

1. Seasonally flooded areas that contribute to the biological productivity of the river system by producing allochthonous (humus, silt, organic detritus, colloidal matter, and plants and animals produced outside the river and brought into the river) organic matter which provides and supports much of the food base of the listed fishes; and

2. Few or no predatory or competitive nonnative species in occupied Virgin River fishes' habitats or potential reestablishment sites.

(ii) Florida. Bay, Escambia, Holmes, Jackson, Okaloosa, Santa Rosa, Walton, and Washington Counties.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Alabama pearlshell, round ebonyshell, southern kidneyshell, Choctaw bean, tapered pigtoe, narrow pigtoe, southern sandshell, and fuzzy pigtoe consist of five components:

(i) Geomorphically stable stream and river channels and banks (channels that maintain lateral dimensions, longitudinal profiles, and sinuosity patterns over time without an aggrading or degrading bed elevation).

(ii) Stable substrates of sand or mixtures of sand with clay or gravel with low to moderate amounts of fine sediment and attached filamentous algae.

(iii) A hydrologic flow regime (magnitude, frequency, duration, and seasonality of discharge over time) necessary to maintain benthic habitats where the species are found, and to maintain connectivity of rivers with the floodplain, allowing the exchange of nutrients and sediment for habitat maintenance, food availability, and spawning habitat for native fishes.

(iv) Water quality, including temperature (not greater than 32 °C), pH (between 6.0 to 8.5), oxygen content (not less than 5.0 milligrams per liter), hardness, turbidity, and other chemical characteristics necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(v) The presence of fish hosts. Diverse assemblages of native fish species will serve as a potential indication of host fish presence until appropriate host fishes can be identified. For the fuzzy pigtoe and tapered pigtoe, the presence of blacktail shiner (*Cyprinella venusta*) will serve as a potential indication of fish host presence.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, dams, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on November 9, 2012, with the exception of the impoundments created by Point A and Gantt Lake dams (impounded water, not the actual dam structures).

The 1:100,000 river reach (route) files were used to calculate river kilometers and miles. ESRIs ArcGIS 9.3.1 software was used to determine longitude and latitude coordinates using decimal degrees. The projection used in mapping all units was Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), NAD 83, Zone 16 North. The following data sources were referenced to identify features (like roads and streams) used to delineate the upstream and downstream extents of critical habitat units: NHD data, Washington County USFWS National Wetlands Inventory, 1999 Florida Department of Transportation Roads Characteristics Inventory (RCI) dataset, U.S. Census Bureau 2000 TIGER line waterbody data, ESRIs World Street Map Service, Florida Department of Transportation General Highway Maps, DeLorme Atlas and Gazetteers, and USGS 7.5 minute topographic maps. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's internet site, *http://www.fws.gov/PanamaCity, http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2011-0050, and at the field office responsible for this designation.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Cherokee, Coosa, and Clay Counties, Alabama; Murray and Whitfield Counties, Georgia; and Bradley and Polk Counties, Tennessee, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements (PCEs) of critical habitat for the Georgia pigtoe are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Geomorphically stable stream and river channels and banks (channels that maintain lateral dimensions, longitudinal profiles, and sinuosity patterns over time without an aggrading or degrading bed elevation).

(ii) A hydrologic flow regime (the magnitude, frequency, duration, and seasonality of discharge over time) necessary to maintain benthic habitats where the species is found. Unless other information becomes available, existing conditions at locations where the species occurs will be considered as minimal flow requirements for survival.

(iii) Water quality (including temperature, pH, hardness, turbidity, oxygen content, and chemical constituents) that meets or exceeds the current aquatic life criteria established under the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251-1387).

(iv) Sand, gravel, cobble, boulder, or bedrock substrates with low to moderate amounts of fine sediment and attached filamentous algae.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted on the maps below for Colbert, Jackson, Limestone, Madison, and Marshall Counties, Alabama; Tishomingo County, Mississippi; Bedford, Bledsoe, Claiborne, Cocke, Franklin, Giles, Greene, Hamblen, Hancock, Hickman, Humphreys, Lincoln, Marion, Marshall, Maury, Moore, Perry, Polk, and Sequatchie Counties, Tennessee; and Bland, Lee, Russell, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Washington, and Wythe Counties, Virginia.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of slabside pearlymussel consist of five components:

(i) Riffle habitats within large, geomorphically stable stream channels (channels that maintain lateral dimensions, longitudinal profiles, and sinuosity patterns over time without an aggrading or degrading bed elevation).

(ii) Stable substrates of sand, gravel, and cobble with low to moderate amounts of fine sediment and containing flow refugia with low shear stress.

(iii) A natural hydrologic flow regime (magnitude, frequency, duration, and seasonality of discharge over time) necessary to maintain benthic habitats where the species is found, and connectivity of rivers with the floodplain, allowing the exchange of nutrients and sediment for habitat maintenance, food availability for all life stages, and spawning habitat for native fishes.

(iv) Water quality with low levels of pollutants and including a natural temperature regime, pH (between 6.0 to 8.5), oxygen content (not less than 5.0 milligrams/liter), hardness, and turbidity necessary for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(v) The presence of abundant fish hosts, which may include the popeye shiner, rosyface shiner, saffron shiner, silver shiner, telescope shiner, Tennessee shiner, whitetail shiner, white shiner, and eastern blacknose dace, necessary for recruitment of the slabside pearlymussel.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, dams, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on October 28, 2013.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created with USGS National Hydrography Dataset (NHD+) GIS data. The 1:100,000 river reach (route) files were used to calculate river kilometers and miles. ESRIs ArcGIS 10.0 software was used to determine longitude and latitude coordinates using decimal degrees. The projection used in mapping all units was USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic USGS version, NAD 83, meters. The following data sources were referenced to identify features (like roads and streams) used to delineate the upstream and downstream extents of critical habitat units: NHD+ flowline and waterbody data, 2011 Navteq roads data, USA Topo ESRI online basemap service, DeLorme Atlas and Gazetteers, and USGS 7.5 minute topographic maps. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the field office Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/cookeville*), at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0026, and at the Service's Tennessee Fish and Wildlife Office.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the Neosho mucket on the maps below in the following Counties:

(i) Benton and Washington Counties, Arkansas;

(ii) Allen, Cherokee, Coffey, Elk, Greenwood, Labette, Montgomery, Neosho, Wilson, and Woodson Counties, Kansas;

(iii) Jasper, Lawrence, McDonald, and Newton Counties, Missouri; and

(iv) Adair, Cherokee, and Delaware Counties, Oklahoma.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Neosho mucket consist of five components:

(i) Geomorphically stable river channels and banks (channels that maintain lateral dimensions, longitudinal profiles, and sinuosity patterns over time without an aggrading or degrading bed elevation) with habitats that support a diversity of freshwater mussel and native fish (such as stable riffles, sometimes with runs, and mid-channel island habitats that provide flow refuges consisting of gravel and sand substrates with low to moderate amounts of fine sediment and attached filamentous algae).

(ii) A hydrologic flow regime (the severity, frequency, duration, and seasonality of discharge over time) necessary to maintain benthic habitats where the species are found and to maintain connectivity of rivers with the floodplain, allowing the exchange of nutrients and sediment for maintenance of the mussel's and fish host's habitat, food availability, spawning habitat for native fishes, and the ability for newly transformed juveniles to settle and become established in their habitats.

(iii) Water and sediment quality (including, but not limited to, conductivity, hardness, turbidity, temperature, pH, ammonia, heavy metals, and chemical constituents) necessary to sustain natural physiological processes for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(iv) The occurrence of natural fish assemblages, reflected by fish species richness, relative abundance, and community composition, for each inhabited river or creek that will serve as an indication of appropriate presence and abundance of fish hosts necessary for recruitment of the Neosho mucket. Suitable fish hosts for Neosho mucket glochidia include smallmouth bass (*Micropterus dolomieu*), largemouth bass (*Micropterus salmoides*), and spotted bass (*Micropterus punctulatus*).

(v) Competitive or predaceous invasive (nonnative) species in quantities low enough to have minimal effect on survival of freshwater mussels.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as dams, piers and docks, bridges, or other similar structures) within the legal boundaries on June 1, 2015.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were developed using ESRI ArcGIS mapping software along with various spatial data layers. Critical habitat unit upstream and downstream limits were delineated at the nearest road crossing or stream confluence of each occupied reach. Data layers defining map units were created with U.S. Geological Survey National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Medium Flowline data. ArcGIS was also used to calculate river kilometers (rkm) and river miles (rmi) from the NHD dataset, and it was used to determine longitude and latitude coordinates in decimal degrees. The projection used in mapping and calculating distances and locations within the units was North American Albers Equal Area Conic, NAD 83. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates, plot points, or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/arkansas-es/te\_listing.html*), the Federal eRulemaking Portal (*http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0007), and at the field office responsible for this designation.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for rabbitsfoot on the maps below in the following Counties:

(i) Colbert, Jackson, Madison, and Marshall Counties, Alabama;

(ii) Arkansas, Ashley, Bradley, Clark, Cleburne, Cleveland, Drew, Hot Spring, Independence, Izard, Jackson, Lawrence, Little River, Marion, Monroe, Newton, Ouachita, Randolph, Searcy, Sevier, Sharp, Van Buren, White, and Woodruff Counties, Arkansas;

(iii) Massac, Pulaski, and Vermilion Counties, Illinois;

(iv) Carroll, Pulaski, Tippecanoe, and White Counties, Indiana;

(v) Allen and Cherokee Counties, Kansas;

(x) McCurtain and Rogers Counties, Oklahoma;

(xi) Crawford, Erie, Mercer, and Venango Counties, Pennsylvania; and

(xii) Hardin, Hickman, Humphreys, Marshall, Maury, Montgomery, Perry, and Robertson Counties, Tennessee.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the rabbitsfoot consist of five components:

(i) Geomorphically stable river channels and banks (channels that maintain lateral dimensions, longitudinal profiles, and sinuosity patterns over time without an aggrading or degrading bed elevation) with habitats that support a diversity of freshwater mussel and native fish (such as stable riffles, sometimes with runs, and mid-channel island habitats that provide flow refuges consisting of gravel and sand substrates with low to moderate amounts of fine sediment and attached filamentous algae).

(ii) A hydrologic flow regime (the severity, frequency, duration, and seasonality of discharge over time) necessary to maintain benthic habitats where the species are found and to maintain connectivity of rivers with the floodplain, allowing the exchange of nutrients and sediment for maintenance of the mussel's and fish host's habitat, food availability, spawning habitat for native fishes, and the ability for newly transformed juveniles to settle and become established in their habitats.

(iii) Water and sediment quality (including, but not limited to, conductivity, hardness, turbidity, temperature, pH, ammonia, heavy metals, and chemical constituents) necessary to sustain natural physiological processes for normal behavior, growth, and viability of all life stages.

(iv) The occurrence of natural fish assemblages, reflected by fish species richness, relative abundance, and community composition, for each inhabited river or creek that will serve as an indication of appropriate presence and abundance of fish hosts necessary for recruitment of the rabbitsfoot. Suitable fish hosts for rabbitsfoot may include, but are not limited to, blacktail shiner (*Cyprinella venusta*) from the Black and Little River and cardinal shiner (*Luxilus cardinalis*), red shiner (*C. lutrensis*), spotfin shiner (*C. spiloptera*), bluntface shiner (*C. camura*), rainbow darter (*Etheostoma caeruleum*), rosyface shiner (*Notropis rubellus*), striped shiner (*L. chrysocephalus*), and emerald shiner (*N. atherinoides*).

(v) Competitive or predaceous invasive (nonnative) species in quantities low enough to have minimal effect on survival of freshwater mussels.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as dams, piers and docks, bridges, or other similar structures) within the legal boundaries on June 1, 2015.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were developed using ESRI ArcGIS mapping software along with various spatial data layers. Critical habitat unit upstream and downstream limits were delineated at the nearest road crossing or stream confluence of each occupied reach. Data layers defining map units were created with U.S. Geological Survey National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Medium Flowline data. ArcGIS was also used to calculate river kilometers (rkm) and river miles (rmi) from the NHD dataset, and it was used to determine longitude and latitude coordinates in decimal degrees. The projection used in mapping and calculating distances and locations within the units was North American Albers Equal Area Conic, NAD 83. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates, plot points, or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/arkansas-es/te\_listing.html*), the Federal eRulemaking Portal (*http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0007), and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements include, but are not limited to, those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, reproduction, and dispersal. The primary constituent elements for the Morro shoulderband snail are the following: sand or sandy soils; a slope not greater than 10 percent; and the presence of, or the capacity to develop, coastal dune scrub vegetation.

3. Critical habitat does not include existing developed sites consisting of buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airports, paved areas, and similar features and structures.

Newcomb's Snail (*Erinna newcombi*)

(1) Critical Habitat Units are depicted for the County of Kauai, Hawaii, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements required by the Newcomb's snail are those habitat components that are essential for the biological needs of foraging, sheltering, reproduction, and dispersal. The primary constituent elements are: cool, clean, moderate-to fast-flowing water in streams, springs, and seeps; their adjacent riparian areas and hydrogeologic features that capture and direct water flow to these spring and stream systems; a perennial flow of water throughout even the most severe drought conditions; and stream channel morphology that provides protection from channel scour by having overhanging waterfalls, protected tributaries, or similar refugia.

(3) Existing human-made features and structures within the boundaries of the mapped units, such as dams, ditches, tunnels, flumes, and other human-made features that do not contain the primary constituent elements, are not included as critical habitat.

2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements include:

(i) Fraser fir or fir-dominated spruce-fir forests at and above 1,646 m (5,400 ft) in elevation; and

(ii) Moderately thick and humid, but not wet, moss (species in the genus *Dicranodontium,* and possibly *Polytrichum*) and/or liverwort mats on rock surfaces that are adequately sheltered from the sun and rain (by overhang and aspect) and include a thin layer of humid soil and/or humus between the moss and rock surface.

3. Existing human structures and other features not containing all of the primary constituent elements are not considered critical habitat.

(h) *Crustaceans.*

Diminutive amphipod (*Gammarus hyalleloides*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Jeff Davis County and Reeves County, Texas, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of diminutive amphipod are springs and spring-fed aquatic systems that contain:

(i) Permanent, flowing, unpolluted water (free from contamination) emerging from the ground and flowing on the surface;

(ii) Water temperatures that vary between 11 and 27 °C (52 to 81 °F) with natural seasonal and diurnal variations slightly above and below that range;

(iii) Substrates that include cobble, gravel, pebble, sand, silt, and aquatic vegetation, for breeding, maturing, feeding, and escape from predators;

(iv) Abundant food, consisting of algae, bacteria, decaying organic material, and submergent vegetation that contributes the necessary nutrients, detritus, and bacteria on which these species forage; and

(v) Either an absence of nonnative predators and competitors or nonnative predators and competitors at low population levels.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, well pads, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on August 8, 2013.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on 2010 aerial photography from U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agriculture Imagery Program base maps using ArcMap (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.), a computer geographic information system (GIS) program. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the on the internet at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2013-0004 and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the island of Kauai, Hawaii, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements for the Kauai cave amphipod are:

(i) The presence of subterranean spaces from 5 mm to 25 cm (0.2 in to 10 in) at their narrowest point (collectively termed “mesocaverns”) and/or cave passages greater than 25 cm (\>10 in);

(ii) Dark and/or stagnant air zones that maintain relative humidity at saturation levels (≥100 percent); and

(iii) The presence in these types of mesocaverns or caves of roots from living, nontoxic plants such as, but not limited to, ohia (*Metrosideros polymorpha*), maiapilo (*Capparis sandwichiana*), and aalii (*Dodonea viscosa*).

(3) All critical habitat areas contain one or more of the primary constituent elements for the Kauai cave amphipod.

(4)(i) Existing human-constructed features and structures within the boundaries of mapped units that involved trenching, filling, or excavation resulting in below-surface modification or alteration would not contain either of the primary constituent elements and are excluded from critical habitat designation. Such features and structures include but are not limited to: Homes and buildings for which the underlying bedrock has been altered for their construction or through incorporation of or connection to buried structural foundations, septic tanks, city sewage and drainage systems, or water or underground electrical supply corridors; paved roads; and areas previously or currently used as a quarry.

(ii) Areas that have been modified on the surface but without trenching, filling, or excavation resulting in below-surface modification or alteration are included in the critical habitat designation, even if they are adjacent to areas that have undergone below-surface modification.

(5) Critical habitat units are described below. Coordinates in UTM Zone 4 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The following map shows the general locations of the 14 critical habitat units designated on the island of Kauai.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Butte, Colusa, Mariposa, Merced, Solano, Stanislaus, Tehama, and Ventura Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for Conservancy fairy shrimp (*Branchinecta conservatio*) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by mounds and swales and depressions within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in complexes of continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the swales connecting the pools described below in paragraph (2)(ii), providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools;

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water for a minimum of 19 days, in all but the driest years; thereby providing adequate water for incubation, maturation, and reproduction. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands;

(iii) Sources of food, expected to be detritus occurring in the pools, contributed by overland flow from the pools' watershed, or the results of biological processes within the pools themselves, such as single-celled bacteria, algae, and dead organic matter, to provide for feeding; and

(iv) Structure within the pools described above in paragraph (2)(ii), consisting of organic and inorganic materials, such as living and dead plants from plant species adapted to seasonally inundated environments, rocks, and other inorganic debris that may be washed, blown, or otherwise transported into the pools, that provide shelter.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Unit descriptions are depicted for Ventura, Orange, and San Diego Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Riverside fairy shrimp consist of three components:

(i) Ephemeral wetland habitat consisting of vernal pools and ephemeral habitat that have wet and dry periods appropriate for the incubation, maturation, and reproduction of the Riverside fairy shrimp in all but the driest of years, such that the pools:

(A) Are inundated (pond) approximately 2 to 8 months during winter and spring, typically filled by rain, surface, and subsurface flow;

(B) Generally dry down in the late spring to summer months;

(C) May not pond every year; and

(D) Provide the suitable water chemistry characteristics to support the Riverside fairy shrimp. These characteristics include physiochemical factors such as alkalinity, pH, temperature, dissolved solutes, dissolved oxygen, which can vary depending on the amount of recent precipitation, evaporation, or oxygen saturation; time of day; season; and type and depth of soil and subsurface layers. Vernal pool habitat typically exhibits a range of conditions but remains within the physiological tolerance of the species. The general ranges of conditions include, but are not limited to:

(*1*) Dilute, freshwater pools with low levels of total dissolved solids (low ion levels (sodium ion concentrations generally below 70 millimoles per liter));

(*2*) Low alkalinity levels (lower than 80 to 1,000 milligrams per liter (mg/l)); and

(*3*) A range of pH levels from slightly acidic to neutral (typically in range of 6.4-7.1).

(ii) Intermixed wetland and upland habitats that function as the local watershed, including topographic features characterized by mounds, swales, and low-lying depressions within a matrix of upland habitat that result in intermittently flowing surface and subsurface water in swales, drainages, and pools described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this entry. Associated watersheds provide water to fill the vernal or ephemeral pools in the winter and spring months. Associated watersheds vary in size and therefore cannot be generalized, and they are affected by factors including surface and underground hydrology, the topography of the area surrounding the pool or pools, the vegetative coverage, and the soil substrates in the area. The size of associated watersheds likely varies from a few acres to greater than 100 ac (40 ha).

(iii) Soils that support ponding during winter and spring which are found in areas characterized in paragraphs (h)(2)(i) and (h)(2)(ii), respectively, of this entry, that have a clay component or other property that creates an impermeable surface or subsurface layer. Soil series with a clay component or an impermeable surface or subsurface layer typically slow percolation, increase water run-off (at least initially), and contribute to the filling and persistence of ponding of ephemeral wetland habitat where the Riverside fairy shrimp occurs. Soils and soil series known to support vernal pool habitat include, but are not limited to:

(A) The Azule, Calleguas, Cropley, and Linne soils series in Ventura County;

(B) The Alo, Balcom, Bosanko, Calleguas, Cieneba, and Myford soils series in Orange County;

(C) The Cajalco, Claypit, Murrieta, Porterville, Ramona, Traver, and Willows soils series in Riverside County; and

(D) The Diablo, Huerhuero, Linne, Placentia, Olivenhain, Redding, Salinas, and Stockpen soils series in San Diego County.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on January 3, 2013.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using a base of U.S. Geological Survey 7.5′ quadrangle maps. Unit descriptions were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 11, North American Datum (NAD) 1983 coordinates. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public on *http://regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2011-0013, on our Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/carlsbad/*), and at the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Office, 6010 Hidden Valley Road, Suite 101, Carlsbad, CA 92011.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Orange and San Diego counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the San Diego fairy shrimp are:

(i) Vernal pools with shallow to moderate depths (2 in (5 cm) to 12 in (30 cm)) that hold water for sufficient lengths of time (7 to 60 days) necessary for incubation, maturation, and reproduction of the San Diego fairy shrimp, in all but the driest years;

(ii) Topographic features characterized by mounds and swales and depressions within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in complexes of continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the swales connecting the pools described in paragraph (2)(i) of this entry, providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools (*i.e.*, the vernal pool watershed); and

(iii) Flat to gently sloping topography, and any soil type with a clay component and/or an impermeable surface or subsurface layer known to support vernal pool habitat (including Carlsbad, Chesterton, Diablo, Huerhuero, Linne, Olivenhain, Placentia, Redding, and Stockpen soils).

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were created using a base of U.S. Geological Survey 7.5′ quadrangle maps, and the critical habitat units were then mapped using UTM coordinates.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for vernal pool fairy shrimp (*Branchinecta lynchi*) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by mounds and swales and depressions within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in complexes of continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the swales connecting the pools described below in paragraph (2)(ii), providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools;

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water for a minimum of 18 days, in all but the driest years; thereby providing adequate water for incubation, maturation, and reproduction. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands;

(iii) Sources of food, expected to be detritus occurring in the pools, contributed by overland flow from the pools' watershed, or the results of biological processes within the pools themselves, such as single-celled bacteria, algae, and dead organic matter, to provide for feeding; and

(iv) Structure within the pools described above in paragraph (3)(ii), consisting of organic and inorganic materials, such as living and dead plants from plant species adapted to seasonally inundated environments, rocks, and other inorganic debris that may be washed, blown, or otherwise transported into the pools, that provide shelter.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Lancaster and Saunders Counties, Nebraska, on the map below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Salt Creek tiger beetle consist of saline barrens and seeps found within saline wetland habitat in Little Salt, Rock, Oak and Haines Branch Creeks. For our evaluation, we determined that two habitat types within suitable wetlands are required by the Salt Creek tiger beetle:

(i) Exposed mudflats associated with saline wetlands or the exposed banks and islands of streams and seeps that contain adequate soil moisture and soil salinity are essential core habitats. These habitats support egg-laying and foraging requirements. The “Salmo” soil series is the only soil type that currently supports occupied habitat; however, “Saltillo” is the other soil series that has adequate soil moisture and salinity and can also provide suitable habitat.

(ii) Vegetated wetlands adjacent to core habitats that provide shade for subspecies thermoregulation, support a source of prey for adults and larval forms of Salt Creek tiger beetles, and protect core habitats.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on June 5, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using National Wetlands Inventory polygons, habitat categorization classes, and an image object analysis. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site at *http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/invertebrates/saltcreektiger/,* at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R6-ES-2013-0068, and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties, Florida, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Bartram's scrub-hairstreak butterfly are:

(i) Areas of pine rockland habitat, and in some locations, associated rockland hammocks and hydric pine flatwoods.

(A) Pine rockland habitat contains:

(*1*) Open canopy, semi-open subcanopy, and understory.

(*2*) Substrate of oolitic limestone rock.

(*3*) A plant community of predominately native vegetation.

(B) Rockland hammock habitat associated with the pine rocklands contains:

(*1*) Canopy gaps and edges with an open semi-open canopy, subcanopy, and understory.

(*2*) Substrate with a thin layer of highly organic soil covering limestone or organic matter that accumulates on top of the underlying limestone rock.

(*3*) A plant community of predominately native vegetation.

(C) Hydric pine flatwood habitat associated with the pine rocklands contains:

(*1*) Open canopy with a sparse or absent subcanopy, and dense understory.

(*2*) Substrate with a thin layer of poorly drained sands and organic materials that accumulates on top of the underlying limestone or calcareous rock.

(*3*) A plant community of predominately native vegetation.

(ii) Competitive nonnative plant species in quantities low enough to have minimal effect on survival of Bartram's scrub-hairstreak butterfly.

(iii) The presence of the butterfly's hostplant, pineland croton, in sufficient abundance for larval recruitment, development, and food resources, and for adult butterfly nectar source and reproduction;

(iv) A dynamic natural disturbance regime or one that artificially duplicates natural ecological processes (e.g. fire, hurricanes or other weather events, at appropriate intervals) that maintains the pine rockland habitat and associated rockland hammock and hydric pine flatwood plant communities.

(v) Pine rockland habitat and associated rockland hammock and hydric pine flatwood plant communities that allow for connectivity and are sufficient in size to sustain viable populations of Bartram's scrub hairstreak butterfly.

(vi) Pine rockland habitat and associated rockland hammock and hydric pine flatwood plant communities with levels of pesticide low enough to have minimal effect on the survival of the butterfly or its ability to occupy the habitat.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 11, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using ESRI ArcGIS mapping software along with various spatial data layers. ArcGIS was also used to calculate the size of habitat areas. The projection used in mapping and calculating distances and locations within the units was North American Albers Equal Area Conic, NAD 83. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates, plot points, or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/verobeach/*), the Federal eRulemaking Portal (*http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0031), and at the field office responsible for this designation.

![](/graphics/er12au14.011.gif)Bay Checkerspot Butterfly (*Euphydryas editha bayensis*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Bay checkerspot butterfly are the habitat components that provide:

(i) The presence of annual or perennial grasslands with little to no overstory that provide north-south and east-west slopes with a tilt of more than 7 degrees for larval host plant survival during periods of atypical weather (for example, drought). Common grassland species include wild oats (*Avena fatua*), soft chess (*Bromus hordeaceus*), California oatgrass (*Danthonia californica*), purple needlegrass (*Nassella pulchra*), and Idaho fescue (*Festuca idahoensis*); less abundant in these grasslands are annual and perennial forbs such as filaree (*Erodium botrys*), true clovers (*Trifolium* sp.), dwarf plantain (*Plantago erecta*), and turkey mullein (*Croton setigerus*). These species, with the exception of dwarf plantain, are not required by the Bay checkerspot butterfly, but merely are provided here as an example of species commonly found in California grasslands.

(ii) The presence of the primary larval host plant, dwarf plantain (*Plantago erecta*), and at least one of the secondary host plants, purple owl's-clover (*Castilleja densiflora*) or exserted paintbrush (*Castilleja exserta*), are required for reproduction, feeding, and larval development.

(iii) The presence of adult nectar sources for feeding. Common nectar sources include desertparsley (*Lomatium* spp.), California goldfields (*Lasthenia californica*), tidy-tips (*Layia platyglossa*), sea muilla (*Muilla maritima*), scytheleaf onion (*Allium falcifolium*), false babystars (*Linanthus androsaceus*), and intermediate fiddleneck (*Amsinckia intermedia*).

(iv) Soils derived from serpentinite ultramafic rock (Montara, Climara, Henneke, Hentine, and Obispo soil series) or similar soils (Inks, Candlestick, Los Gatos, Fagan, and Barnabe soil series) that provide areas with fewer aggressive, nonnative plant species for larval host plant and adult nectar plant survival and reproduction.

(v) The presence of stable holes and cracks in the soil, and surface rock outcrops that provide shelter for the larval stage of the Bay checkerspot butterfly during summer diapause.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles using USDA National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) county-wide MrSID compressed mosaics of 1 meter resolution and natural color aerial photography from summer 2005. Critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 10, North American Datum (NAD) 1983 coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties, Florida, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Florida leafwing butterfly consist of six components:

(i) Areas of pine rockland habitat, and in some locations, associated rockland hammocks and hydric pine flatwoods.

(A) Pine rockland habitat contains:

(*1*) Open canopy, semi-open subcanopy, and understory.

(*2*) Substrate of oolitic limestone rock.

(*3*) A plant community of predominately native vegetation.

(B) Rockland hammock habitat associated with pine rocklands contains:

(*1*) Canopy gaps and edges with an open to semi-open canopy, subcanopy, and understory.

(*2*) Substrate with a thin layer of highly organic soil covering limestone or organic matter that accumulates on top of the underlying limestone rock.

(*3*) A plant community of predominately native vegetation.

(C) Hydric pine flatwood habitat associated with pine rocklands contains:

(*1*) Open canopy with a sparse or absent subcanopy, and dense understory.

(*2*) Substrate with a thin layer of poorly drained sands and organic materials that accumulates on top of the underlying limestone or calcareous rock.

(*3*) A plant community of predominately native vegetation.

(ii) Competitive nonnative plant species in quantities low enough to have minimal effect on survival of the Florida leafwing butterfly.

(iii) The presence of the butterfly's hostplant, pineland croton, in sufficient abundance for larval recruitment, development, and food resources, and for adult butterfly roosting habitat and reproduction.

(iv) A dynamic natural disturbance regime or one that artificially duplicates natural ecological processes (e.g., fire, hurricanes or other weather events, at appropriate intervals) that maintains the pine rockland habitat and associated rockland hammock and hydric pine flatwood plant communities.

(v) Pine rockland habitat and associated rockland hammock and hydric pine flatwood plant communities sufficient in size to sustain viable Florida leafwing populations.

(vi) Pine rockland habitat and associated rockland hammock and hydric pine flatwood plant communities with levels of pesticide low enough to have minimal effect on the survival of the butterfly or its ability to occupy the habitat.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 11, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using ESRI ArcGIS mapping software along with various spatial data layers. ArcGIS was also used to calculate the size of habitat areas. The projection used in mapping and calculating distances and locations within the units was North American Albers Equal Area Conic, NAD 83. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates, plot points, or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/verobeach*), the Federal eRulemaking Portal (*http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0031), and at the field office responsible for this designation.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Clark County, Nevada, on the map below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Mount Charleston blue butterfly consist of three components:

(i) Areas of dynamic habitat between 2,500 meters (m) (8,200 feet (ft)) and 3,500 m (11,500 ft) elevation with openings or where disturbance provides openings in the canopy that have no more than 50 percent tree cover (allowing sunlight to reach the ground); widely spaced, low (less than 15 centimeters (cm) (0.5 ft) in height) forbs and grasses; and exposed soil and rock substrates. When taller grass and forb plants greater than or equal to 15 cm (0.5 ft) in height are present, the density is less than five per square meter (m2) (50 per square foot (ft2)).

(ii) The presence of one or more species of host plants required by larvae of the Mount Charleston blue butterfly for feeding and growth. Known larval host plants are *Astragalus calycosus* var. *calycosus, Oxytropis oreophila* var. *oreophila,* and *Astragalus platytropis.* Densities of host plants must be greater than two per m2 (0.2 per ft2).

(iii) The presence of one or more species of nectar plants required by adult Mount Charleston blue butterflies for reproduction, feeding, and growth. Common nectar plants include *Erigeron clokeyi, Hymenoxys lemmonii,**Hymenoxys cooperi,* and *Eriogonum umbellatum* var. *versicolor.* Densities of nectar plants must occur at more than two per m2 (0.2 per ft2) for smaller plants, such as *E. clokeyi,* and more than 0.1 per m2 (0.01 per ft2) for larger and taller plants, such as *Hymenoxys* sp. and *E. umbellatum.* Nectar plants typically occur within 10 m (33 ft) of larval host plants and, in combination, provide nectar during the adult flight period between mid-July and early August. Additional nectar sources that could be present in combination with the common nectar plants include *Antennaria rosea, Cryptantha* sp., *Ericameria nauseosa* ssp., *Erigeron flagellaris, Guitierrezia sarothrae,**Monardella odoratissima, Petradoria pumila* var. *pumila,* and *Potentilla concinna* var. *concinna.*

Taylor's Checkerspot Butterfly (*Euphydryas editha taylori*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Island, Clallam, and Thurston Counties in Washington, and in Benton County in Oregon, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Taylor's checkerspot butterfly consist of four components:

(i) Patches of early seral, short-statured, perennial bunchgrass plant communities composed of native grass and forb species in a diverse topographic landscape ranging in size from less than 1 ac up to 100 ac (0.4 to 40 ha) with little or no overstory forest vegetation that have areas of bare soil for basking that contain:

(A) In Washington and Oregon, common bunchgrass species found on northwest grasslands include *Festuca roemeri* (Roemer's fescue), *Danthonia californica* (California oat grass), *Koeleria cristata* (prairie Junegrass), *Elymus glaucus* (blue wild rye), *Agrostis scabra* (rough bentgrass), and on cooler, high-elevation sites typical of coastal bluffs and balds, *Festuca rubra* (red fescue).

(B) On moist grasslands found near the coast and in the Willamette Valley, there may be *Bromus sitchensis* (Sitka brome) and *Deschampsia cespitosa* (tufted hairgrass) in the mix of prairie grasses. Less abundant forbs found on the grasslands include, but are not limited to, *Trifolium* spp. (true clovers), narrow-leaved plantain (*Plantago lanceolata*), harsh paintbrush (*Castilleja hispida*), Puget balsamroot (*Balsamorhiza deltoidea*), woolly sunshine (*Eriophyllum lanatum*), nine-leaved desert parsley (*Lomatium triternatum*), fine-leaved desert parsley (*Lomatium utriculatum*), common camas (*Camassia quamash),* showy fleabane (*Erigeron speciosus*), Canada thistle (*Cirsium arvense*), common yarrow (*Achillea millefolium*), prairie lupine (*Lupinus lepidus*), and sickle-keeled lupine (*Lupinus albicaulis*).

(ii) Primary larval host plants (narrow-leaved plantain and harsh paintbrush) and at least one of the secondary annual larval host plants (blue-eyed Mary (*Collinsia parviflora*), sea blush (*Plectritis congesta),* or dwarf owl-clover (*Triphysaria pusilla*) or one of several species of speedwell (marsh speedwell (*Veronica scutella*), American speedwell (*V. beccabunga* var. *americana*), or thymeleaf speedwell (*V. serpyllifolia*).

(iii) Adult nectar sources for feeding that include several species found as part of the native (and one nonnative) species mix on northwest grasslands, including: narrow-leaved plantain; harsh paintbrush; Puget balsam root; woolly sunshine; nine-leaved desert parsley; fine-leaved desert parsley or spring gold; common camas; showy fleabane; Canada thistle; common yarrow; prairie lupine; sickle-keeled lupine; and wild strawberry (*Fragaria virginiana*).

(iv) Aquatic features such as wetlands, springs, seeps, streams, ponds, lakes, and puddles that provide moisture during periods of drought, particularly late in the spring and early summer. These features can be permanent, seasonal, or ephemeral.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, railroad tracks, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on November 4, 2013.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining the map unit were created on 2010 aerial photography from U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agriculture Imagery Program base maps using ArcMap (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.), a computer geographic information system (GIS) program. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/wafwo/*), at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R1-ES-2013-0009), and by appointment at the Service's Washington Fish and Wildlife Office. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

![](/graphics/er18se12.028.gif)Hine's Emerald Dragonfly (*Somatochlora hineana*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Cook, DuPage, and Will Counties in Illinois; Alpena, Mackinac, and Presque Isle Counties in Michigan; Crawford, Dent, Iron, Phelps, Reynolds, Ripley, Washington, and Wayne Counties in Missouri; and Door and Ozaukee Counties in Wisconsin, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the Hine's emerald dragonfly are:

(i) For egg deposition and larval growth and development:

(A) Organic soils (histosols, or with organic surface horizon) overlying calcareous substrate (predominantly dolomite and limestone bedrock);

(B) Calcareous water from intermittent seeps and springs and associated shallow, small, slow-flowing streamlet channels, rivulets, and/or sheet flow within fens;

(C) Emergent herbaceous and woody vegetation for emergence facilitation and refugia;

(D) Occupied burrows maintained by crayfish for refugia; and

(E) Prey base of aquatic macroinvertebrates, including mayflies, aquatic isopods, caddisflies, midge larvae, and aquatic worms.

(ii) For adult foraging, reproduction, dispersal, and refugia necessary for roosting, for resting, for adult females to escape from male harassment, and for predator avoidance (especially during the vulnerable teneral stage):

(A) Natural plant communities near the breeding/larval habitat which may include fen, marsh, sedge meadow, dolomite prairie, and the fringe (up to 328 ft (100 m)) of bordering shrubby and forested areas with open corridors for movement and dispersal; and

(B) Prey base of small, flying insect species (e.g., dipterans).

(3) Critical habitat does not include human-made structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, lawns, old fields, hay meadows, fallow crop fields, manicured lawns, pastures, piers and docks, aqueducts, airports, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located. We define “old field” here as cleared areas that were formerly forested and may have been used as crop or pasture land that currently support a mixture of native and nonnative herbs and low shrubs. “Fallow field” is defined as a formerly plowed field that has been left unseeded for a season or more and is presently uncultivated. In addition, critical habitat does not include open-water areas (*i.e.*, areas beyond the zone of emergent vegetation) of lakes and ponds.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5' quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Geographical Information Systems, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates. Critical habitat units are described using the public land survey system (township (T), range (R) and section (Sec.)).

1. The unit of critical habitat is depicted for Santa Cruz County, California, on the map below. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

![](/graphics/er07fe01.017.gif)

2. Within this area, the primary constituent elements for the Zayante band-winged grasshopper are those physical and biological elements that provide conditions that are essential for the primary biological needs of thermoregulation, foraging, sheltering, reproduction, and dispersal. The primary constituent elements are - (a) the presence of Zayante soils, (b) the occurrence of Zayante sand hills habitat and the associated plant species, and (c) certain microhabitat conditions, including areas that receive large amounts of sunlight, widely scattered tree and shrub cover, bare or sparsely vegetated ground, and loose sand. Zayante sand hills habitat is characterized by plant species associated with ponderosa pine sand parkland and/or silverleaf manzanita mixed chaparral. Plant species that may occur within the boundaries include, but are not limited to - ponderosa pine (*Pinus ponderosa*), silver-leafed manzanita (*Arctostaphylos silvicola*), California lilac (*Ceonothus* sp.), *Adenostoma* sp., yerba santa (*Eriodictyon* sp.), sandwort (*Minuartia* sp.), pussypaws (*Calyptridium umbellatum*), Ben Lomond spineflower (*Erysimum teretifolium*), monkeyflower (*Mimulus rattanii*), miniature lupine (*Lupinis bicolor*), gilia (*Gilia tenuiflora*), California aster (*Lessingia filaginifolia*), Ben Lomond buckwheat (*Eriogonum nudum* ssp. *decurrens*), and Ben Lomond spineflower (*Chorizanthe pungens* var. *hartwegiana*).

3. Critical habitat does not include existing developed sites consisting of buildings, roads, aquaducts, railroads, airports, paved areas, and similar features and structures.

Santa Cruz County, California. Boundaries are based upon the Public Land Survey System. Within the historical boundaries of the Land Grants of Zayanta, San Augustin, La Carbonera, and Canada Del Rincon En El Rio San Lorenzo De Santa Cruz, boundaries are based upon section lines that are extensions to the Public Land Survey System developed by the California Department of Forestry and obtained by the Service from the State of California's Stephen P. Teale Data Center. Township and Range numbering is derived from the Mount Diablo Base and Meridian. The following lands located within Santa Cruz County are being proposed for critical habitat: T.9 S., R.1 W., SE1/4 sec. 31; T.9 S., R.2 W., SE1/4 sec. 33, E1/2 sec. 34, SW1/4 sec. 35, S1/2 sec. 3; T.10 S., R1 W., W1/2 sec. 6; T.10 S., R.2 W., sec. 1, S1/2 NW1/4 sec. 2, sec. 3, W1/2 sec. 4, W1/2 sec. 9, sec. 10, sec. 11, sec. 13, sec. 14, N1/2 SE1/4 sec. 15, NE1/4 sec. 22, secs. 23-26, N1/2 sec. 35, sec. 36, excluding all lands covered under the Revised Habitat Conservation Plan for the Quail Hollow Quarry and the Habitat Conservation Plan for the Hanson Aggregates' Felton Plant.

Blackburn's Sphinx Moth (*Manduca blackburni*)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the Hawaiian islands of Maui, Kahoolawe, Hawaii, and Molokai on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for Blackburn's sphinx moth include specific habitat components identified as essential for the primary biological needs of foraging, sheltering, maturation, dispersal, breeding, and egg-laying.

(i) Based on our current knowledge of the species, the primary constituent elements required by Blackburn's sphinx moth larvae for foraging and maturation are two larval host plant species in the endemic genus *Nothocestrum* (*N. breviflorum* and *N. latifolium*) and the habitats that support these plants, *i.e.,* dry and mesic habitats between the elevations of sea level and 1,525 m (5,000 ft) that receive between 25 and 250 cm (10 and 100 in) of annual precipitation.

(ii) Based on our current knowledge of the species, the primary constituent elements required by Blackburn's sphinx moth adults for foraging, sheltering, dispersal, breeding, and egg production are native nectar-supplying plants, including, but not limited to, *Ipomoea* spp., *Capparis sandwichiana,* and *Plumbago zeylanica,* and the habitats that support these plants, *i.e.,* dry and mesic habitats between the elevations of sea level and 1,525 m (5,000 ft) that receive between 25 and 250 cm (10 and 100 in) of annual precipitation.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures within the boundaries of the mapped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements described for the species in paragraph (2) of this section, and therefore, are not included in the critical habitat designations. These features include, but are not limited to: buildings; roads; aqueducts and other water system features such as pumping stations, irrigation ditches, pipelines, siphons, tunnels, water tanks, gauging stations (section in a stream channel equipped with facilities for obtaining streamflow data), intakes, and wells; telecommunications towers and associated structures and equipment; electrical power transmission lines and associated rights-of-way; radars; telemetry antennas; missile launch sites; arboreta and gardens; heiau (indigenous places of worship or shrines); airports; other paved areas; lawns; and other rural residential landscaped areas.

(4) Critical habitat units are described below. Coordinates are in UTM Zone 4 with units in meters using North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). The following index map shows the general locations of the 9 critical habitat units designated on the islands of Hawaii, Kahoolawe, Maui, and Molokai.

(1) Critical habitat units are designated in Chippewa, Clay, Kittson, Lincoln, Murray, Norman, Pipestone, Polk, Pope, and Swift Counties in Minnesota; McHenry, McKenzie, Ransom, Richland, and Rolette Counties in North Dakota; and Brookings, Day, Deuel, Grant, Marshall, and Roberts Counties in South Dakota, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the Dakota skipper consist of three components:

(i) Primary Constituent Element 1 - Wet-mesic tallgrass or mixed-grass remnant untilled prairie that occurs on near-shore glacial lake soil deposits or high-quality dry-mesic remnant untilled prairie on rolling terrain consisting of gravelly glacial moraine soil deposits, containing:

(A) A predominance of native grasses and native flowering forbs;

(B) Glacial soils that provide the soil surface or near surface (between soil surface and 2 cm depth) micro-climate conditions conducive to Dakota skipper larval survival and native-prairie vegetation;

(C) If present, trees or large shrub cover of less than 5 percent of area in dry prairies and less than 25 percent in wet-mesic prairies; and

(D) If present, nonnative invasive plant species occurring in less than 5 percent of area.

(ii) Primary Constituent Element 2 - Native grasses and native flowering forbs for larval and adult food and shelter, specifically:

(A) At least one of the following native grasses to provide food and shelter sources during Dakota skipper larval stages: prairie dropseed *(Sporobolus heterolepis)* or little bluestem *(Schizachyrium scoparium);* and

(B) One or more of the following forbs in bloom to provide nectar and water sources during the Dakota skipper flight period: purple coneflower *(Echinacea angustifolia),* bluebell bellflower *(Campanula rotundifolia),* white prairie clover *(Dalea candida),* upright prairie coneflower *(Ratibida columnifera),* fleabane *(Erigeron* spp.), blanketflower *(Gaillardia* spp.), black-eyed Susan *(Rudbeckia hirta),* yellow sundrops *(Calylophus serrulatus),* prairie milkvetch *(Astragalus adsurgens),* or common gaillardia *(Gaillardia aristata) .*

(iii) Primary Constituent Element 3 - Dispersal grassland habitat that is within 1 km (0.6 mi) of native high-quality remnant prairie (as defined in Primary Constituent Element 1) that connects high-quality wet-mesic to dry tallgrass prairies or moist meadow habitats. Dispersal grassland habitat consists of undeveloped open areas dominated by perennial grassland with limited or no barriers to dispersal including tree or shrub cover less than 25 percent of the area and no row crops such as corn, beans, potatoes, or sunflowers.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on November 2, 2015.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created and digitized using ESRI's ArcMap (version 10.0) and comparing USGS NAIP/FSA high-resolution orthophotography from 2010 or later and previously mapped skipper habitat polygons submitted by contracted researchers or prairie habitat polygons made available from Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' County Biological Survey. Critical habitat units then were mapped in Geographic Coordinate System WGS84. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/midwest/Endangered*), at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R3-ES-2013-0017, and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

![](/graphics/er12de06.003.gif)Poweshiek Skipperling *(Oarisma Poweshiek)*

(1) Critical habitat units are designated for Cerro Gordo, Dickinson, Emmet, Howard, Kossuth, and Osceola Counties in Iowa; in Hilsdale, Jackson, Lenawee, Livingston, Oakland, and Washtenaw Counties in Michigan; Chippewa, Clay, Cottonwood, Douglas, Kittson, Lac Qui Parle, Lincoln, Lyon, Mahnomen, Murray, Norman, Pipestone, Polk, Pope, Swift, and Wilkin Counties in Minnesota; Richland County in North Dakota; Brookings, Day, Deuel, Grant, Marshall, Moody, and Roberts Counties in South Dakota; and Green Lake and Waukesha Counties in Wisconsin, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Poweshiek skipperling consist of four components:

(i) Primary Constituent Element 1 - Wet-mesic to dry tallgrass remnant untilled prairies or remnant moist meadows containing:

(A) A predominance of native grasses and native flowering forbs;

(B) Undisturbed (untilled) glacial soil types including, but not limited to, loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, gravel, organic soils (peat), or marl that provide the edaphic features conducive to Poweshiek skipperling larval survival and native-prairie vegetation;

(C) If present, depressional wetlands or low wet areas, within or adjacent to prairies that provide shelter from high summer temperatures and fire;

(D) If present, trees or large shrub cover less than 5 percent of area in dry prairies and less than 25 percent in wet-mesic prairies and prairie fens; and

(E) If present, nonnative invasive plant species occurring in less than 5 percent of area.

(ii) Primary Constituent Element 2 - Prairie fen habitats containing:

(A) A predominance of native grasses and native flowering forbs;

(B) Undisturbed (untilled) glacial soil types including, but not limited to, organic soils (peat), or marl that provide the edaphic features conducive to Poweshiek skipperling larval survival and native-prairie vegetation;

(C) Depressional wetlands or low wet areas, within or adjacent to prairies that provide shelter from high summer temperatures and fire;

(D) Hydraulic features necessary to maintain prairie fen groundwater flow and prairie fen plant communities;

(E) If present, trees or large shrub cover less than 25 percent of the unit; and

(F) If present, nonnative invasive plant species occurring in less than 5 percent of area.

(iii) Primary Constituent Element 3 - Native grasses and native flowering forbs for larval and adult food and shelter, specifically:

(A) At least one of the following native grasses available to provide larval food and shelter sources during Poweshiek skipperling larval stages: Prairie dropseed *(Sporobolus heterolepis),* little bluestem *(Schizachyrium scoparium),* sideoats grama *(Bouteloua curtipendula),* or mat muhly *(Muhlenbergia richardsonis);* and

(B) At least one of the following forbs in bloom to provide nectar and water sources during the Poweshiek skipperling flight period: Purple coneflower *(Echinacea angustifolia),* black-eyed Susan *(Rudbeckia hirta),* smooth ox-eye *(Heliopsis helianthoides),* stiff tickseed *(Coreopsis palmata),* palespike lobelia *(Lobelia spicata),* sticky tofieldia *(Triantha glutinosa),* or shrubby cinquefoil *(Dasiphora fruticosa* ssp. *floribunda).*

(iv) Primary Constituent Element 4 - Dispersal grassland habitat that is within 1 km (0.6 mi) of native high-quality remnant prairie (as defined in Primary Constituent Element 1) that connects high-quality wet-mesic to dry tallgrass prairies, moist meadows, or prairie fen habitats. Dispersal grassland habitat consists of the following physical characteristics appropriate for supporting Poweshiek skipperling dispersal: Undeveloped open areas dominated by perennial grassland with limited or no barriers to dispersal including tree or shrub cover less than 25 percent of the area and no row crops such as corn, beans, potatoes, or sunflowers.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on November 2, 2015.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created and digitized using ESRI's ArcMap (version 10.0) and comparing USGS NAIP/FSA high-resolution orthophotography from 2010 or later and previously mapped skipper habitat polygons submitted by contracted researchers or prairie habitat polygons made available from Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' County Biological Survey. Critical habitat units then were mapped in Geographic Coordinate System WGS84.
