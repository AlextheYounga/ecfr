(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Jackson and Josephine Counties, Oregon, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Lomatium cookii* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) *In the Rogue River Valley:*

(A) Vernal pools and ephemeral wetlands and depths and the adjacent upland margins of these depressions that hold water for a sufficient length of time to sustain *Lomatium cookii* germination, growth, and reproduction. These vernal pools or ephemeral wetlands support native plant populations and are seasonally inundated during wet years but do not necessarily fill with water every year due to natural variability in rainfall. Areas of sufficient size and quality are likely to have the following characteristics:

(*1*) Elevations from 372 to 411 m (1,220 to 1,350 ft);

(*2*) Associated dominant native plants including, but not limited to: *Alopecurus saccatus, Achnatherum lemmonii*, *Deschampsia danthonioides, Eryngium petiolatum, Lasthenia californica, Myosurus minimus*, *Navarretia leucocephala* ssp. *leucocephala, Phlox gracilis, Plagiobothrys bracteatus*, *Trifolium depauperatum*, and *Triteleia hyacinthina*; and

(*3*) A minimum area of 8 ha (20 ac) to provide intact hydrology and protection from development and weed sources.

(B) The hydrologically and ecologically functional system of interconnected pools or ephemeral wetlands or depressions within a matrix of surrounding uplands that together form vernal pool complexes within the greater watershed. The associated features may include the pool basin and ephemeral wetlands; an intact hardpan subsoil underlying the surface soils up to 0.75 m (2.5 ft) in depth; and surrounding uplands, including mound topography and other geographic and edaphic features that support systems of hydrologically interconnected pools and other ephemeral wetlands (which may vary in extent depending on site-specific characteristics of pool size and depth, soil type, and hardpan depth).

(C) Silt, loam, and clay soils that are of ultramafic and nonultramafic alluvial origin, with a 0 to 3 percent slope, classified as Agate-Winlo or Provig-Agate soils.

(D) No or negligible presence of competitive, nonnative invasive plant species. Negligible is defined for the purpose of this rule as a minimal level of nonnative plant species that will still allow *Lomatium cookii* to continue to survive and recover.

(ii) *In the Illinois River Valley:*

(A) Wet meadows in oak and pine forests, sloped mixed-conifer openings, and shrubby plant communities that are seasonally inundated and support native plant populations. Areas of sufficient size and quality are likely to have the following characteristics:

(*1*) Elevations from 383 to 488 m (1,256 to 1,600 ft);

(*2*) Associated dominant native plants including, but not limited to: *Achnatherum lemmonii, Arbutus menziesii, Arctostaphylos viscida, Camassia* spp*., Ceanothus cuneatus*, *Danthonia californica, Deschampsia cespitosa*, *Festuca roemeri* var. *klamathensis, Poa secunda*, *Ranunculus occidentalis*, and *Limnanthes gracilis* var. *gracilis*;

(*3*) Occurrence primarily in bottomland *Quercus garryana-Quercus kelloggii-Pinus ponderosa* (Oregon white oak-California black oak-ponderosa pine) forest openings along seasonal creeks; and

(*4*) A minimum area of 8 ha (20 ac) to provide intact hydrology and protection from development and weed sources.

(B) The hydrologically and ecologically functional system of streams, slopes, and wooded systems that surround and maintain seasonally wet alluvial meadows underlain by relatively undisturbed ultramafic soils within the greater watershed.

(C) Silt, loam, and clay soils that are of ultramafic and nonultramafic alluvial origin, with a 0 to 40 percent slope, classified as Abegg gravelly loam, Brockman clay loam, Copsey clay, Cornutt-Dubakel complex, Dumps, Eightlar extremely stony clay, Evans loam, Foehlin gravelly loam, Josephine gravelly loam, Kerby loam, Newberg fine sandy loam, Pearsoll-Rock outcrop complex, Pollard loam, Riverwash, Speaker-Josephine gravelly loam, Takilma cobbly loam, or Takilma Variant extremely cobbly loam.

(D) No or negligible presence of competitive, nonnative invasive plant species. Negligible is defined for the purpose of this rule as a minimal level of nonnative plant species that will still allow *Lomatium cookii* to continue to survive and recover.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (including, but not limited to, buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* These critical habitat units were mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 10, North American Datum 1983 (UTM NAD 83) coordinates. These coordinates establish the vertices and endpoints of the boundaries of the units.

![](/graphics/er03no09.034.gif)Family Asteraceae: *Deinandra conjugens* (Otay tarplant)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Diego County, California, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Deinandra conjugens* are those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of the species. Based on our current knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements for *Deinandra conjugens* consist of, but are not limited to, soils with a high clay content (generally greater than 25 percent) (or clay intrusions or lenses) that are associated with grasslands, open coastal sage scrub, or maritime succulent scrub communities between 25 m (80 ft) and 300 m (1,000 ft) elevation. These plant communities contain natural openings that provide habitat for *Deinandra conjugens* life-cycle, and pollen and seed dispersal agents.

(3) Critical habitat does not include non-Federal lands covered by a legally operative Habitat Conservation Plan issued under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Act in which *Deinandra conjugens* is a covered species on or before the publication of this final rule.

(4) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, paved or unpaved roads, and other landscaped areas not containing primary constituent elements, are not likely to contain the primary constituent elements for *Deinandra conjugens.* Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they affect the species or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Benton, Lane, Linn, Marion, and Polk Counties, Oregon, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Erigeron decumbens* var. *decumbens* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Early seral upland prairie, wet prairie, or oak savanna habitat with a mosaic of low-growing grasses and forbs, and spaces to establish seedlings or new vegetative growth; an absence of dense canopy vegetation; and undisturbed subsoils.

(3) Critical habitat does not include man-made structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas, and the land on which such structures are located) existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Critical habitat units are described below. Data layers defining map units were created using USGS 24,000 scale Digital Ortho Quads captured in 2000. Critical habitat units were then mapped using UTM zone 10, NAD 1983 coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Bernardino County, California, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Erigeron parishii* are those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of the species. Based on our current knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements of critical habitat for this species are listed below and consist of, but are not limited to:

(i) Soils derived primarily from upstream or upslope limestone, dolomite, or quartz monzonite parent materials that occur on dry, rocky hillsides, shallow drainages, or outwash plains at elevations between 1,171 and 1,950 m (3,842 and 6,400 ft);

(ii) Soils with intact, natural surfaces that have not been substantially altered by land use activities (e.g., graded, excavated, re-contoured, or otherwise altered by ground-disturbing equipment); and

(iii) Associated plant communities that have areas with an open canopy cover.

(3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, active mines, paved or unpaved roads, other paved or cleared areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, are not likely to contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they may affect the species or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Chaves, Cibola, and Guadalupe Counties, New Mexico, and for Pecos County, Texas, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) Within critical habitat units, the primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Helianthus paradoxus* are the desert wetland or riparian habitat components that provide:

(i) Silty clay or fine sand soils that contain high organic content, are saline or alkaline, are permanently saturated within the root zone (top 50 cm (19.7 in) of the soil profile), and have salinity levels ranging from 10 to 40 parts per thousand; and

(ii) A low proportion (less than 10 percent) of woody shrub or canopy cover directly around the plant.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located, existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 1:24,0000 maps, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

![](/graphics/er01ap08.347.gif)Family Asteraceae: *Helianthus verticillatus* (whorled sunflower)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Cherokee County, Alabama; Floyd County, Georgia; and Madison and McNairy Counties, Tennessee, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of whorled sunflower consist of three components:

(i) Silt loam, silty clay loam, or fine sandy loam soils on land forms including broad uplands, depressions, stream terraces, and floodplains within the headwaters of the Coosa River in Alabama and Georgia and the East Fork Forked Deer and Tuscumbia rivers in Tennessee.

(ii) Sites in which forest canopy is absent, or where woody vegetation is present at sufficiently low densities to provide full or partial sunlight to whorled sunflower plants for most of the day, and which support vegetation characteristic of moist prairie communities. Invasive, nonnative plants must be absent or present in sufficiently low numbers to not inhibit growth or reproduction of whorled sunflower.

(iii) Occupied sites in which a sufficient number of compatible mates are present for outcrossing and production of viable achenes to occur.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 25, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of Bing Maps digital aerial photography supplied by the Harris Corporation, Earthstar Geographics LLC, and the Microsoft Corporation. Critical habitat units were then mapped using the USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Projection with a NAD 83 datum. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site at *http://www.fws.gov/cookeville*, at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0086, and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

![](/graphics/er26au14.004.gif)Family Asteraceae: *Holocarpha macradenia* (Santa Cruz tarplant)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Contra Costa, Santa Cruz, and Monterey Counties, California, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Holocarpha macradenia* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Soils associated with coastal terrace prairies, including the Watsonville, Tierra, Elkhorn, Santa Inez, and Pinto series.

(ii) Plant communities that support associated species, including native grasses such as *Nassella* sp.(needlegrass) and *Danthonia californica* (California oatgrass); native herbaceous species such as members of the genus *Hemizonia* (other tarplants), *Perideridia gairdneri* (Gairdner's yampah), *Plagiobothrys diffusus* (San Francisco popcorn flower), and *Trifolium buckwestiorum* (Santa Cruz clover); and

(iii) Physical processes, particularly soils and hydrologic processes, that maintain the soil structure and hydrology that produce the seasonally saturated soils characteristic of *Holocarpha macradenia* habitat.

(3) Critical habitat does not include existing features and structures, such as buildings, roads, aqueducts, railroads, airport runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) *Critical Habitat Map Units.* (i) Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 7.5′ quadrangles obtained from the State of California's Stephen P. Teale Data Center. Critical habitat units were then mapped using UTM coordinates.

![](/graphics/er16oc02.009.gif)Family Asteraceae: *Lasthenia conjugens* (Contra Costa goldfields)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Alameda, Contra Costa, Mendocino, Napa, and Solano Counties, California, on the maps in this entry. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Lasthenia conjugens* (Contra Costa goldfields) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by isolated mound and intermound complex within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the depressional features including swales connecting the pools described below in paragraph (2)(ii), providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools;

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water or whose soils are saturated for a period long enough to promote germination, flowering, and seed production of predominantly annual native wetland species and typically exclude both native and nonnative upland plant species in all but the driest years. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands;

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

Family Asteraceae: *Yermo xanthocephalus* (Desert yellowhead)

(1) Critical habitat unit is depicted for Fremont County, Wyoming, on the map below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Yermo xanthocephalus* are those habitat components that are essential for the primary needs of the species. Based upon our current knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements include, but are not limited to:

(i) Recent soils derived from sandstones and limestones of the Split Rock Formation at its junction with the White River Formation. These are shallow, loamy soils of the Entisol order that can be classified as course-loamy over sandy-skeletal, mixed, Lithic Torriorthent. The surface stratum has little organic matter, and subsurface layers show no accumulation of humus, clay, gypsum, salts, or carbonates.

(ii) Plant communities associated with *Yermo xanthocephalus* that include, but may not be limited to, sparsely vegetated cushion plant communities with scattered clumps of *Oryzopsis hymenoides* (Indian ricegrass) between 2,043 and 2,073 m (6,700 and 6,800 ft) in Fremont County, Wyoming. Species common to these communities include *Arenaria hookeri* (Hooker's sandwort), *Astragalus kentrophyta* (thistle milkvetch), *Hymenoxys acaulis* (stemless hymenoxy), and *Phlox muscoides* (squarestem phlox). These cushion-plant communities also contain natural openings.

(iii) Topographic features/relief and physical processes, particularly hydrologic processes, that maintain the shape and orientation of the hollows characteristic of *Yermo xanthocephalus* and maintain moisture below the surface of the ground.

(3) Critical habitat: Fremont County, Wyoming.

(1) Critical habitat is depicted for Riverside County, California, in the text and on the map in this entry. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Berberis nevinii* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Low-gradient (*i.e.*, nearly flat) canyon floors, washes and adjacent terraces, and mountain ridge/summits, or eroded, generally northeast to northwest-facing mountain slopes and banks of dry washes typically of less than 70 percent slope that provide space for plant establishment and growth;

(ii) Well-drained alluvial soils primarily of non-marine sedimentary origin, such as Temecula or sandy arkose soils; soils of the Cajalco-Temescal-Las Posas soil association formed on gabbro (igneous) or latite (volcanic) bedrock; metasedimentary substrates associated with springs or seeps; and heavy adobe/gabbro-type soils derived from metavolcanic geology (Mesozoic basic intrusive rock) that provide the appropriate nutrients and space for growth and reproduction; and

(iii) Scrub (chaparral, coastal sage, alluvial, riparian) and woodland (oak, riparian) vegetation communities between 900 and 3,000 feet (275 and 915 meters) in elevation that provide the appropriate cover for growth and reproduction.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) Critical habitat map. Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 1:24,000 maps and critical habitat units were then mapped using a 100-meter grid to establish Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) North American Datum 1927 (NAD 27) coordinates which, when connected, provided the boundaries of the unit. All acreage calculations were performed using GIS.

Family Brassicaceae: *Arabis georgiana* (Georgia Rockcress)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted in Georgia, including Clay, Gordon, Floyd, Harris, and Muscogee Counties, and in Alabama, including Bibb, Dallas, Elmore, Monroe, Sumter, and Wilcox Counties, on the maps in this entry.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of *Arabis georgiana* (Georgia rockcress) consist of four components:

(i) Large river bluffs with steep and/or shallow soils that are subject to localized disturbances that limit the accumulation of leaf litter and competition within the Lower Gulf Coastal Plain, Upper Gulf Coastal Plain, Red Hills, Black Belt, Piedmont, and Ridge and Valley Physiographic Provinces of Georgia and Alabama.

(ii) Well-drained soils that are buffered or circumneutral generally within regions underlain or otherwise influenced by granite, sandstone, or limestone.

(iii) A mature, mixed-level canopy with spatial heterogeneity, providing mottled shade and often including species such as *Juniperus virginiana* (eastern red cedar), *Ostrya virginiana* (American hophornbeam), *Quercus muehlenbergii (*chinquapin oak), *Fraxinus americana* (white ash), *Acer barbatum* (southern sugar maple), and *Cercis canadensis* (eastern redbud) with a rich diversity of grasses and forbs characterizing the herb layer.

(iv) Intact habitat that is fully functional (i.e., with mature canopy and discrete disturbances) and buffered by surrounding habitat to impede the invasion of competitors.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on October 14, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining critical habitat map units were created using GIS shapefiles of Natural Heritage Element Occurrence (EO) data for *Arabis georgiana* (Georgia rockcress) locations that were provided by the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, and 1-meter resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) images from 2009. Each EO feature was buffered by 76 meters (m) (250 feet (ft)) up and down slope and 304.8 m (1,000 ft) laterally. The 76-m (250-ft) buffer was used as a guideline for delineating critical habitat upslope and downslope of the EO feature, with the downslope direction extending 76 m (250 ft) or to the edge of the water, whichever was shorter. The 304.8-m (1,000-ft) buffer was used a guideline for delineating critical habitat adjacent to the EO features along the length of the river. The critical habitat polygons were manually drawn using a mouse on a computer screen by visually checking for PCEs within the buffer areas against 2009 NAIP imagery. The critical habitat polygons were then viewed over the ArcGIS basemap Bing Aerial Imagery as an additional assessment tool for the placement of the critical habitat polygon boundaries. Critical habitat units were mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), zone 16N. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site at *http://www.fws.gov/athens/,* at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0030, and at the Ecological Services Office in Athens, Georgia.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Franklin, Henry, and Owen Counties, Kentucky, and Rutherford and Wilson Counties, Tennessee, on the maps in this entry. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) Based on the best available information, primary constituent elements essential for the conservation of *Arabis perstellata* are:

(i) Relatively undisturbed, closed canopy mesophytic and sub-xeric forest with large, mature trees (such as sugar maple (*Acer saccharum*), chinquapin oak (*Quercus muhlenbergii*), hackberry (*Celtus occidentalis*), or Ohio buckeye (*Aesculus glabra*)), and

(ii) Open forest floors with little herbaceous cover and leaf litter accumulation with natural disturbance to allow for *Arabis perstellata* germination and seedling germination, and

(iii) Areas with few introduced weed species such as *Alliaria petiolata* or *Lonicera maackii*, and

(iv) Rock outcrops on moderate to steep calcareous slopes defined by:

(A) Ordovician limestone, in particular the Grier, Tanglewood, and Macedonia Bed Members of the Lexington Limestone in Kentucky and the Lebanon, Carters, Leipers, and Catheys, and Bigby-Cannon Limestones in Tennessee; and

(B) Limestone soils such as the Fairmont Rock outcrop complexes in Kentucky and the Mimosa Rock outcrop complexes in Tennessee.

(3) Existing features and structures made by people, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements and are not critical habitat. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Augustine and Sabine Counties, Texas, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of *Leavenworthia texana* consist of the three primary constituent elements identified for the species:

(i) Exposed outcrops of the Weches Formation within Weches prairies. Within the outcrop sites, there must be bare, exposed bedrock on top-level surfaces or rocky ledges with small depressions where rainwater or seepage can collect. The openings should support Weches Glade native herbaceous plant communities.

(ii) Thin layers of rocky, alkaline soils, underlain by glauconite clay (greenstone, ironstone, bluestone), that are found only on the Weches Formation. Appropriate soils are in the series classifications Nacogdoches clay loam, Trawick gravelly clay loam, or Bub clay loam, ranging in slope from 1-15 percent.

(iii) The outcrop ledges should occur within the glade such that Texas golden gladecress plants remain unshaded for a significant portion of the day, and trees should be far enough away from the outcrop(s) that leaves do not accumulate within the gladecress habitat. The habitat should be relatively clear of nonnative and native invasive plants, especially woody species, or with only a minimal level of invasion.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, bridges, aqueducts, runways, well pads, metering stations, roads and the filled areas immediately adjacent to pavement, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on October 11, 2013.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Soil Survey Geographic Dataset (SSURGO) was used as a base map layer. The SSURGO is an updated digital version of the Natural Resources Conservation Service county soil surveys. The SSURGO uses recent digital orthophotos and fieldwork to update the original printed surveys. Data layers defining map units were created using the Texas golden gladecress' restriction to the Weches Formation and its tight association with the three soil map units: Nacogdoches clay loam 1-5 percent slope, Trawick gravelly clay loam 5-15 percent slope, or Bub clay loam 2-5 percent slope. In San Augustine and Sabine Counties, these soil types are restricted to the Weches Formation. Locations of all known gladecress populations, as well as potential glade sites, were overlaid on the three afore-named soil mapping units from the San Augustine and Sabine County's soils survey. Potential glade sites were identified using soil map units and a time series of aerial photographs that depicted changes in land cover. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's internet site, at *http://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/ElectronicLibrary/ElectronicLibrary\_Main.cfm,* at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2013-0027, and at the field office responsible for this designation.

Family Brassicaceae: *Lesquerella kingii* ssp. *bernardina* (San Bernardino Mountains bladderpod)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Bernardino County, California, on the map in this entry. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Lesquerella kingii* ssp. *bernardina* are those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of the species. Based on our current knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements of critical habitat for this species are listed below and consist of, but are not limited to:

(i) Soils derived primarily from Bonanza King Formation and Undivided Cambrian parent materials that occur on hillsides or on large rock outcrops at elevations between 2,098 and 2,700 m (6,883 and 8,800 ft);

(ii) Soils with intact, natural surfaces that have not been substantially altered by land use activities (e.g., graded, excavated, re-contoured, or otherwise altered by ground-disturbing equipment); and

(iii) Associated plant communities that have areas with an open canopy cover and little accumulation of organic material (e.g., leaf litter) on the surface of the soil.

(3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, active mines, paved or unpaved roads, other paved or cleared areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, are not likely to contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they may affect the species or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Short's bladderpod consist of three components:

(i) Bedrock formations and outcrops of calcareous limestone, sometimes with interbedded shale or siltstone, in close proximity to the mainstem or tributaries of the Kentucky and Cumberland rivers. These outcrop sites or areas of suitable bedrock geology should be located on steeply sloped hillsides or bluffs, typically on south- to west-facing aspects.

(ii) Shallow or rocky, well-drained soils formed from the weathering of underlying calcareous bedrock formations, which are undisturbed or subjected to minimal disturbance, so as to retain habitat for ground-nesting pollinators and potential for maintenance of a soil seed bank.

(iii) Forest communities with low levels of canopy closure or openings in the canopy to provide adequate sunlight for individual and population growth. Invasive, nonnative plants must be absent or present in sufficiently low numbers not to inhibit growth or reproduction of Short's bladderpod.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 25, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of Bing Maps digital aerial photography supplied by the Harris Corporation, Earthstar Geographics LLC, and the Microsoft Corporation. Critical habitat units were then mapped using the USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Projection with a NAD 83 datum. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site at *http://www.fws.gov/cookeville*, at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0086, and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

1. Critical habitat units are depicted for Starr County, Texas, on the maps below. Critical habitat includes National Wildlife Refuge tracts and one private land site. Maps are for general informational purposes only; the legal descriptions precisely define critical habitat boundaries.

2. Within these areas, the primary constituent elements include:

(a) Arid upland habitats of various soil types, including highly calcareous sandy loam to loamy sand, with low to moderate salinity levels on low sloping hills;

(b) Absence of substantial previous soil disturbance and seeding or sodding of exotic grasses; and

(c) A sparse overstory of shrub species typical of the Tamaulipan biotic province, but lacking a complete canopy as might be provided by a continuous overstory dominated by mesquite (*Prosopis glandulosa*).

3. Existing features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, urban development, and other features not containing primary constituent elements, are not considered critical habitat.

(1) A critical habitat unit is depicted for Humboldt County, California, on the map below. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Thlaspi californicum* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Thin rocky soils that have developed on exposures of serpentine substrates;

(ii) Plant communities that support a relatively sparse assemblage of serpentine indicator, or facultative-serpentine indicator, species, including various native forbs and grasses, but not trees or shrubs, such that competition for space and water (both above and below ground) and light is reduced, compared to the surrounding habitats. Known associated species include the following: *Festuca rubra* (red fescue), *Koeleria macrantha* (junegrass), *Elymus glaucus* (blue wildrye), *Eriophyllum lanatum* (woolly sunflower), *Lomatium macrocarpum* (large-fruited lomatium), and *Viola hallii* (Hall's violet);

(iii) Serpentine substrates that contain 15 percent or greater (by surface area) of exposed gravels, cobbles, or larger rock fragments, which may contribute to alteration of factors of microclimate, including surface drainage and moisture availability, exposure to wind and sun, and temperature; and

(iv) Prairie grasslands and oak woodlands located within 30 m (100 ft) of the serpentine outcrop area on Ashfield Ridge. Protection of these habitats is essential to the conservation of *Thlaspi californicum* in that it will provide connectivity among the serpentine sites, help to maintain the hydrologic and edaphic integrity of the serpentine sites, and support populations of pollinators and seed dispersal organisms.

(3) Existing features and structures within the boundaries of mapped critical habitat units, such as buildings, roads, airports, and other paved areas will not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(4) Critical habitat unit. Humboldt County, California.

(i) From USGS. 1:24,000 scale Iaqua Buttes quadrangle, land bounded by the following UTM Zone 10 NAD27 coordinate pairs (East, North): 421800, 4507300; 422100, 4507800; 422100, 4507300; 422200, 4507600; 421700, 4507400; 421800, 4507500; 421600, 4507500; 421800, 4507900; 421800, 4507800; 421900, 4507900

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties, Florida, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of *Consolea corallicola* are:

(i) Areas of upland habitats consisting of coastal berm, rockland hammocks, and buttonwood forest.

(A) Coastal berm habitat that contains:

*(1)* Open to semi-open canopy, subcanopy, and understory; and

*(2)* Substrate of coarse, calcareous, and storm-deposited sediment.

(B) Rockland hammock habitat that contains:

*(1)* Canopy gaps and edges with an open to semi-open canopy, subcanopy, and understory; and

*(2)* Substrate with a thin layer of highly organic soil covering limestone or organic matter that accumulates on top of the limestone.

(C) Buttonwood forest habitat that contains:

*(1)* Open to semi-open canopy and understory; and

*(2)* Substrate with calcareous marl muds, calcareous sands, or limestone rock.

(ii) A plant community of predominately native vegetation with no invasive, nonnative animal or plant species or such species in quantities low enough to have minimal effect on survival of *Consolea corallicola.*

(iii) A disturbance regime, due to the effects of strong winds or saltwater inundation from storm surge or infrequent tidal inundation, that creates canopy openings in coastal berm, rockland hammocks, and buttonwood forest.

(iv) Habitats that are connected and of sufficient size to sustain viable populations in coastal berm, rockland hammocks, and buttonwood forest.

(v) Habitats that provide populations of the generalist pollinators that visit the flowers of *Consolea corallicola.*

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located that exists within the legal boundaries on February 22, 2016.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were developed using ESRI ArcGIS mapping software along with various spatial data layers. ArcGIS was also used to calculate area. The projection used in mapping and calculating distances and locations within the units was North American Albers Equal Area Conic, NAD 83. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates, plot points, or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site at *http://www.fws.gov/verobeach/,* at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2014-0057, and at the field office responsible for this designation.

(i) Soils derived from limestone that are found on mesas, plateaus, terraces, the toe of gentle sloping hills with up to 20 percent slope, margins of canyon rims, and desert washes. These soils have the following features:

(A) They occur on the Colorado Plateau in Coconino and Mohave Counties of northern Arizona and are within the appropriate series found in occupied areas;

(B) They are derived from alluvium, colluvium, or eolian deposits of limestone from the Harrisburg member of the Kaibab Formation and limestone, siltstone, and sandstone of the Toroweap and Moenkopi Formations;

(C) They are nonsaline to slightly saline, gravelly, shallow to moderately deep, and well-drained with little signs of soil movement. Soil texture consists of gravelly loam, fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, clay loam, and cobbly loam.

(ii) Native vegetation within the Plains and Great Basin grassland and Great Basin desertscrub vegetation communities from 1,310 to 1,813 m (4,200 to 5,950 ft) in elevation that has a natural, generally intact surface and subsurface that preserves the bedrock substrate and is supportive of microbiotic soil crusts where they are naturally found.

(iii) Native vegetation that provides for habitat of identified pollinators within the effective pollinator distance of 1,000 m (3,280 ft) around each individual Fickeisen plains cactus.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 19, 2016.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using a base of U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' quadrangle maps. Critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator zone 11, North American Datum 1983 coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units for *Arenaria ursina* are found in San Bernardino County, California. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for Arenaria ursina are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Pebble plains in dry meadow-like openings within upper montane coniferous forest, pinyon-juniper woodlands, or Great Basin sagebrush in the San Bernardino Mountains of San Bernardino County, California; at elevations between 5,900 to 9,800 ft (1,830 to 2,990 m) that provide space for individual and population growth, reproduction and dispersal; and

(ii) Seasonally wet clay, or sandy clay soils, generally containing quartzite pebbles, subject to natural hydrological processes that include water hydrating the soil and freezing in winter and drying in summer causing lifting and churning of included pebbles, that provide space for individual and population growth, reproduction and dispersal, adequate water, air, minerals, and other nutritional or physiological requirements to the species.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 1:24,0000 maps, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for the municipalities of Cayey, San Lorenzo, and Patillas, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, on the maps in this entry.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of *Gonocalyx concolor* consist of these components:

(i) Elfin forest at elevations over 2,900 feet (ft) (880 meters (m)) in Cerro La Santa, Puerto Rico, which includes:

(A) Forest with single canopy layer with trees seldom exceeding 22 ft (7 m) in height.

(B) Associated native vegetation dominated by species such as *Tabebuia schumanniana, Tabebuia rigida, Ocotea spathulata, Eugenia borinquensis, Clusia minor,* and *Prestoea acuminata* var. *montana,* native ferns, and dense cover with epiphytes, including bromeliads and mosses.

(ii) Ausubo forest at elevations between 2,000 to 2,300 ft (620 to 720 m) in the Charco Azul, which includes:

(A) Forest with single canopy layer with trees exceeding 22 ft (7 m) in height.

(B) Plant association comprised by few species of native trees and associated native vegetation (e.g., *Manilkara bidentata, Dacryodes excelsa,**Guarea guidonia,* and *Cyrilla racemiflora*), native ferns, and dense cover with epiphytes, including bromeliads and mosses.

(iii) The type locations described in paragraphs (2)(i) and (2)(ii) of this entry for this species should have mean annual precipitation of 88.7 in (225.3 cm), mean annual temperature of 72.3 °F (22.7 °C), and Los Guineos type of soil (i.e., very deep, acidic, clayey, well-drained soils on side slopes of mountains).

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as bridges, docks, and aqueducts) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on October 9, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of U.S. Geological Survey digital ortho-photo quarter-quadrangles, and critical habitat units were then mapped using aerial photos (ArcGis) to limits of the boundaries of the elfin forest and ausubo forest. Critical habitat units were then mapped using ArcMap version 10 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc.), a Geographic Information Systems program. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site at *http://www.fws.gov/caribbean/es,* at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2013-0040, and at the field office responsible for this designation.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Merced, Stanislaus, Tehama, Tulare, and Tuolumne Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Chamaesyce hooveri (Hoover's Spurge)* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by isolated mound and intermound complex within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the depressional features including swales connecting the pools described below in paragraph (2)(ii), providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools;

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water or whose soils are saturated for a period long enough to promote germination, flowering, and seed production of predominantly annual native wetland species and typically exclude both native and nonnative upland plant species in all but the driest years. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands;

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Bernardino County, California, on the map below. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Astragalus albens* are those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of the species. Based on our current knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements of critical habitat for this species are listed below and consist of, but are not limited to:

(i) Soils derived primarily from the upper and middle members of the Bird Spring Formation and Undivided Cambrian parent materials that occur on hillsides or along rocky washes with limestone outwash/deposits at elevations between 1,171 and 2,013 m (3,864 and 6,604 ft);

(ii) Soils with intact, natural surfaces that have not been substantially altered by land use activities (e.g., graded, excavated, re-contoured, or otherwise altered by ground-disturbing equipment); and

(iii) Associated plant communities that have areas with an open canopy cover and little accumulation of organic material (e.g., leaf litter) on the surface of the soil.

(3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, active mines, paved or unpaved roads, other paved or cleared areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, are not likely to contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they may affect the species or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

![](/graphics/er20my04.001.gif)Family Fabaceae: *Lupinus sulphureus* ssp. *kincaidii* (Kincaid's lupine).

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Benton, Lane, Polk, and Yamhill Counties, Oregon, and Lewis County, Washington, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for the *Lupinus sulphureus* ssp. *kincaidii* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Early seral upland prairie, or oak savanna habitat with a mosaic of low-growing grasses and forbs, and spaces to establish seedlings or new vegetative growth; an absence of dense canopy vegetation; and undisturbed subsoils.

(ii) The presence of insect outcrossing pollinators, such as *Bombus mixtus* and *B. californicus,* with unrestricted movement between existing lupine patches.

(3) Critical habitat does not include man-made structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas, and the land on which such structures are located) existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) *Critical Habitat Map Units.* Critical habitat units are described below. Data layers defining map units were created using USGS 24,000 scale Digital Ortho Quads captured in 2000. Critical habitat units were then mapped using UTM zone 10, NAD 1983 coordinates.

![](/graphics/er07no02.003.gif)Family Hydrophyllaceae: *Phacelia submutica* (DeBeque phacelia)

(1) Critical habitat units are designated for Garfield and Mesa Counties, Colorado.

(2) The primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of *Phacelia submutica* consist of five components:

(i) *Suitable soils and geology.*

(A) Atwell Gulch and Shire members of the Wasatch formation.

(B) Within these larger formations, small areas (from 10 to 1,000 ft2 (1 to 100 m2)) on colorful exposures of chocolate to purplish brown, light to dark charcoal gray, and tan clay soils. These small areas are slightly different in texture and color than the similar surrounding soils. Occupied sites are characterized by alkaline (pH range from 7 to 8.9) soils with higher clay content than similar nearby unoccupied soils.

(C) Clay soils that shrink and swell dramatically upon drying and wetting and are likely important in the maintenance of the seed bank.

(ii) *Topography.* Moderately steep slopes, benches, and ridge tops adjacent to valley floors. Occupied slopes range from 2 to 42 degrees with an average of 14 degrees.

(iii) *Elevation and climate.*

(A) Elevations from 4,600 ft (1,400 m) to 7,450 ft (2,275 m).

(B) Climatic conditions similar to those around DeBeque, Colorado, including suitable precipitation and temperatures. Annual fluctuations in moisture (and probably temperature) greatly influences the number of *Phacelia submutica* individuals that grow in a given year and are thus able to set seed and replenish the seed bank.

(iv) *Plant community.*

(A) Small (from 10 to 1,000 ft2 (1 to 100 m2)) barren areas with less than 20 percent plant cover in the actual barren areas.

(B) Presence of appropriate associated species that can include (but are not limited to) the natives *Grindelia fastigiata, Eriogonum gordonii,**Monolepis nuttalliana,* and *Oenothera caespitosa.* Some presence, or even domination by, invasive nonnative species, such as *Bromus tectorum,* may occur, as *Phacelia submutica* may still be found there.

(C) Appropriate plant communities within the greater pinyon-juniper woodlands that include:

(*1*) Clay badlands within the mixed salt desert scrub; or

(*2*) Clay badlands within big sagebrush shrublands.

(v) *Maintenance of the seed bank and appropriate disturbance levels.*

(A) Within suitable soil and geologies (see paragraph (2)(i) of this entry), undisturbed areas where seed banks are left undamaged.

(B) Areas with light disturbance when dry and no disturbance when wet.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 12, 2012.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of both satellite imagery (NAIP 2009) as well as USGS geospatial quadrangle maps and were mapped using NAD 83 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), zone 13N coordinates. Location information came from a wide array of sources. A habitat model prepared by the Colorado Natural Heritage Program also was utilized. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public on *http://regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R6-ES-2011-0040, on our Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/plants/3ColoradoPlants/index.html*), and at the Western Colorado Ecological Services Office, 764 Horizon Drive, Suite B, Grand Junction, CO 81506-3946.

![](/graphics/er13au12.003.gif)Family Lamiaceae: *Acanthomintha ilicifolia* (San Diego thornmint)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Diego County, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent element of critical habitat for *Acanthomintha ilicifolia* is clay lenses that provide substrate for seedling establishment and space for growth and development of *Acanthomintha ilicifolia* that are:

(i) Within chaparral, grassland, and coastal sage scrub;

(ii) On gentle slopes ranging from 0 to 25 degrees;

(iii) Derived from gabbro and soft calcareous sandstone substrates with a loose, crumbly structure and deep fissures (approximately 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm)); and

(iv) Characterized by a low density of forbs and geophytes, and a low density or absence of shrubs.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, and roads) and the land on which such structures are located existing on the effective date of this rule.

(4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were created using a base of U.S. Geological Survey 7.5′ quadrangle maps, and the critical habitat units were then mapped using UTM coordinates.

![](/graphics/ec01jn91.167.gif)Family Lamiaceae: *Monardella viminea* (willowy monardella)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Diego County, California, on the map below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent element of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of *Monardella viminea* is riparian channels with ephemeral drainages and adjacent floodplains:

(i) With a natural hydrological regime, in which:

(A) Water flows only after peak seasonal rainstorms;

(B) High runoff events periodically scour riparian vegetation and redistribute alluvial material to create new stream channels, benches, and sandbars; and

(C) Water flows for usually less than 48 hours after a rain event, without long-term standing water;

(ii) With surrounding vegetation that provides semi-open, foliar cover with:

(A) Little or no herbaceous understory;

(B) Little to no canopy cover;

(C) Open ground cover, less than half of which is herbaceous vegetation cover;

(D) Some shrub cover; and

(E) An association of other plants, including *Eriogonum fasciculatum* (California buckwheat) and *Baccharis sarothroides* (broom baccharis);

(iii) That contain ephemeral drainages that:

(A) [Reserved]

(B) Are made up of coarse, rocky, or sandy alluvium; and

(C) Contain terraced floodplains, terraced secondary benches, stabilized sandbars, channel banks, or sandy washes; and

(iv) That have soil with high sand content, typically characterized by sediment and cobble deposits, and further characterized by a high content of coarse, sandy grains and low content of silt and clay.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using a base of U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' quadrangle maps. Critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 11, North American Datum (NAD) 1983 coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties, California, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Chlorogalum purpureum* var. *purpureum* consist of, but are not limited to:

(i) Soils that are sandy clay to loamy clay, well-drained on the surface, and are often overlain with fine gravel; and,

(ii) Plant communities in functioning ecosystems that support associated plant and animal species (e.g., pollinators, predator-prey species, etc.), including valley and foothill grassland, blue oak woodland or oak savannahs, and open areas within shrubland communities. Within these vegetation community types, *C. p.* var. *purpureum* appears where there is little cover of other species which compete for resources available for growth and reproduction.

(3) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Chlorogalum purpureum* var. *reductum* consist of, but are not limited to:

(i) Well-drained, red clay soils with a large component of gravel and pebbles on the upper soil surface; and,

(ii) Plant communities in functioning ecosystems that support associated plant and animal species (e.g., pollinators, predator-prey species, etc.), including grassland, blue oak woodland (*Quercus douglasii*) or oak savannahs, and open areas within shrubland communities. Within these vegetation communities *C. p.* var. *reductum* appears where there is little cover of other species which compete for resources available for growth and reproduction.

(4) Critical habitat does not include existing features and structures, such as buildings, hard-packed roads (e.g., asphalt, pavement), aqueducts, railroads, airport runways and buildings, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas not containing any of the primary constituent elements.

(5) *Critical Habitat Map Units.* Data layers defining map units were mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

![](/graphics/er24oc02.004.gif)Family Limnanthaceae: *Limnanthes floccosa* ssp. *californica* (Butte County meadowfoam)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Tehama and Butte Counties, California, on the map below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Limnanthes floccosa* ssp. *californica* (Butte County meadowfoam) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by isolated mound and intermound complex within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the depressional features including swales connecting the pools described in paragraph (2)(ii) of this section, providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools; and

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water or whose soils are saturated for a period long enough to promote germination, flowering, and seed production of predominantly annual native wetland species and typically exclude both native and nonnative upland plant species in all but the driest years. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

![](/graphics/er10fe06.055.gif)Family Limnanthaceae: *Limnanthes floccosa* ssp. *grandiflora* (large-flowered woolly meadowfoam)

(1) Critical habitat units for Jackson County, Oregon, are depicted on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Limnanthes floccosa* ssp. *grandiflora* are the following habitat components:

(i) Vernal pools or ephemeral wetlands and the adjacent upland margins of these depressions that hold water for a sufficient length of time to sustain *Limnanthes floccosa* ssp. *grandiflora* germination, growth, and reproduction, occurring in the Rogue River Valley vernal pool landscape. These vernal pools or ephemeral wetlands are seasonally inundated during wet years but do not necessarily fill with water every year due to natural variability in rainfall, and support native plant populations. Areas of sufficient size and quality are likely to have the following characteristics:

(A) Elevations from 372 to 469 m (1,220 to 1,540 ft);

(B) Associated dominant native plants including, but not limited to: *Alopecurus saccatus, Deschampsia danthonioides*, *Eryngium petiolatum, Lasthenia californica, Myosurus minimus*, *Navarretia leucocephala* ssp. *leucocephala, Phlox gracilis, Plagiobothrys bracteatus*, *Trifolium depauperatum*, and *Triteleia hyacinthina.*

(C) A minimum area of 8 ha (20 ac) to provide intact hydrology and protection from development and weed sources.

(ii) The hydrologically and ecologically functional system of interconnected pools, ephemeral wetlands, or depressions within a matrix of surrounding uplands that together form vernal pool complexes within the greater watershed. The associated features may include the pool basin or depressions; an intact hardpan subsoil underlying the surface soils up to 0.75 m (2.5 ft) in depth; and surrounding uplands, including mound topography and other geographic and edaphic features, that support these systems of hydrologically interconnected pools and other ephemeral wetlands (which may vary in extent depending on site-specific characteristics of pool size and depth, soil type, and hardpan depth).

(iii) Silt, loam, and clay soils that are of alluvial origin, with a 0 to 3 percent slope, primarily classified as Agate-Winlo complex soils, but also including Coker clay, Carney clay, Provig-Agate complex soils, and Winlo very gravelly loam soils.

(iv) No or negligible presence of competitive, nonnative, invasive plant species. Negligible is defined for the purpose of this rule as a minimal level of nonnative plant species that will still allow *Limnanthes floccosa* ssp. *grandiflora* to continue to survive and recover.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (including, but not limited to, buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) *Critical habitat unit maps.* These critical habitat units were mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 10, North American Datum 1983 (UTM NAD 83) coordinates. These coordinates establish the vertices and endpoints of the boundaries of the units.

![](/graphics/er24oc07.004.gif)Family Orobanchaceae: *Castilleja cinerea* (ash-gray Indian paintbrush)

(1) Critical habitat units for this species are found in San Bernardino County, California. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Castilleja cinerea* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Pebble plains in dry meadow-like openings, or non-pebble plain dry meadow margin areas, within upper montane coniferous forest, pinyon-juniper woodlands, or Great Basin sagebrush in the San Bernardino Mountains of San Bernardino County, California; at elevations between 5,900 to 9,800 ft (1,830 to 2,990 m) that provide space for individual and population growth, reproduction and dispersal;

(ii) Seasonally wet clay, or sandy clay soils, generally containing quartzite pebbles, subject to natural hydrological processes that include water hydrating the soil and freezing in winter and drying in summer causing lifting and churning of included pebbles, or seasonally wet silt or saline clay soils in non-pebble plain dry meadow margin areas that provide space for individual and population growth, reproduction and dispersal, adequate water, air, minerals, and other nutritional or physiological requirements to the species; and

(iii) The presence of one or more of its known host species such as *Eriogonum kennedyi* var. *austromontanum, E. kennedyi.* var. *kennedyi,* and *E. wrightii* var. *subscaposumon* in pebble plain habitat and species such as *Artemisia tridentata, A. nova,* and *E. wrightii* var. *subscaposumon* in pebble plain and non-pebble plain meadow margin habitat that provide some of the physiological requirements for this species.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 1:24,0000 maps, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

![](/graphics/er26de07.020.gif)Family Phrymaceae: *Diplacus vandenbergensis* (Vandenberg monkeyflower)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Santa Barbara County, California, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Vandenberg monkeyflower consist of two components:

(i) Native maritime chaparral communities of Burton Mesa comprising maritime chaparral and maritime chaparral mixed with coastal scrub, oak woodland, and small patches of native grasslands. The mosaic structure of the native plant communities (arranged in a mosaic of dominant vegetation and sandy openings (canopy gaps)) may change spatially as a result of succession, and physical processes such as windblown sand and wildfire.

(ii) Loose sandy soils on Burton Mesa. As mapped by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), these could include the following soil series: Arnold Sand, Marina Sand, Narlon Sand, Tangair Sand, Botella Loam, Terrace Escarpments, and Gullied Land.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 10, 2015.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 1:24,000 maps, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) Zone 15N coordinates.

![](/graphics/er11au15.002.gif)Family Plantaginaceae: *Penstemon debilis* (Parachute penstemon)

(1) Critical habitat units are designated for Garfield County, Colorado.

(2) The primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of *Penstemon debilis* consist of five components:

(i) *Suitable soils and geology.*

(A) Parachute Member and the Lower Part of the Green River Formation.

(B) Appropriate soil morphology characterized by a surface layer of small to moderate shale channers (small flagstones) that shift continually due to the steep slopes and below a weakly developed calcareous, sandy to loamy layer with 40 to 90 percent coarse material.

(ii) *Elevation and climate.* Elevations from 5,250 to 9,600 ft (1,600 to 2,920 m). Climatic conditions similar to those of the Mahogany Bench, including suitable precipitation and temperatures.

(iii) *Plant community.*

(A) Barren areas with less than 10 percent plant cover.

(B) Other oil shale endemics, which can include: *Mentzelia rhizomata, Thalictrum heliophilum,**Astragalus lutosus, Lesquerella parviflora,**Penstemon osterhoutii,* and *Festuca dasyclada.*

(C) Presence of *Penstemon caespitosa* for support of pollinators and connectivity between sites.

(iv) *Habitat for pollinators.*

(A) Pollinator ground, twig, and mud nesting areas. Nesting and foraging habitats suitable for a wide array of pollinators and their life-history and nesting requirements. A mosaic of native plant communities and habitat types generally would provide for this diversity (see paragraph (2)(iii) of this entry). These habitats can include areas outside of the soils identified in paragraph (2)(i) of this entry.

(B) Connectivity between areas allowing pollinators to move from one population to the next within units.

(C) Availability of other floral resources such as other flowering plant species that provide nectar and pollen for pollinators. Grass species do not provide resources for pollinators.

(D) A 3,280-ft (1,000-m) area beyond occupied habitat to conserve the pollinators essential for plant reproduction.

(v) *High levels of natural disturbance.*

(A) Very little to no soil formation.

(B) Slow to moderate but constant downward motion of the oil shale that maintains the habitat in an early successional state.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 12, 2012.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of both satellite imagery (NAIP 2009) as well as USGS geospatial quadrangle maps and were mapped using NAD 83 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), zone 13N coordinates. Location information came from a wide array of sources. Geology, soil, and landcover layers also were utilized. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public on *http://regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R6-ES-2011-0040, on our Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/plants/3ColoradoPlants/index.html*), and at the Western Colorado Ecological Services Office, 764 Horizon Drive, Suite B, Grand Junction, CO 81506-3946.

(1) A critical habitat unit, including five subunits, is depicted for Brewster County, Texas, on the map below.

(2) Within these areas, the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of Guadalupe fescue consist of:

(i) Areas within the Chihuahuan Desert:

(A) Above elevations of 1,800 m (5,905 ft), and

(B) That contain rocky or talus soils.

(ii) Associated vegetation characterized by relatively open stands of both conifer and oak trees in varying proportions. This vegetation may occur in areas classified as pine, conifer, pine-oak, or conifer-oak, and as forest or woodland, on available vegetation classification maps.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on October 10, 2017.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* We defined the critical habitat unit using the following Geographic Information System data layers: A Digital Elevation Model produced by the U.S. Geological Survey; and a Shapefile of vegetation classifications at Big Bend National Park, created and provided to us by Park personnel. The map in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establishes the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which the map is based are available to the public at the Service's Internet site (*https://www.fws.gov/southwest/es/AustinTexas/ESA\_Our\_species.html*), at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R2-ES-2016-0099 and FWS-R2-ES-2016-0100, and at the field office responsible for this designation. You may obtain field office location information by contacting one of the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

![](/graphics/er07se17.000.gif)Family Poaceae: *Neostapfia colusana* (Colusa grass)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Mariposa, Merced, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, and Yolo Counties, California, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Neostapfia colusana* (Colusa grass) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by isolated mound and intermound complex within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the depressional features including swales connecting the pools described in paragraph (2)(ii) of this section, providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools; and

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water or whose soils are saturated for a period long enough to promote germination, flowering, and seed production of predominantly annual native wetland species and typically exclude both native and nonnative upland plant species in all but the driest years. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

![](/graphics/er10fe06.058.gif)Family Poaceae: *Orcuttia inaequalis* (San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, and Tulare Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Orcuttia inaequalis* (San Joaquin Valley Orcutt grass) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by isolated mound and intermound complex within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the depressional features including swales connecting the pools described in paragraph (2)(ii) of this section, providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools; and

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water or whose soils are saturated for a period long enough to promote germination, flowering, and seed production of predominantly annual native wetland species and typically exclude both native and nonnative upland plant species in all but the driest years. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(13) Unit 15: Bear Valley, San Diego County, California.

(i) [Reserved]

(ii) Unit 15 for *Poa atropurpurea* is depicted on the map in paragraph (12)(ii) of this entry.

Family Poaceae: *Tuctoria greenei* (Greene's Tuctoria)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Butte, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Shasta, Stanislaus, Tehama, and Tuolumne counties, California, on the map below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for Tuctoria greenei (Greene's tuctoria) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by isolated mound and intermound complex within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the depressional features including swales connecting the pools described in paragraph (2)(ii) of this section, providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools; and

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water or whose soils are saturated for a period long enough to promote germination, flowering, and seed production of predominantly annual native wetland species and typically exclude both native and nonnative upland plant species in all but the driest years. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Yolo County, California, on the map below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Tuctoria mucronata* (Solano grass) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by isolated mound and intermound complex within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the depressional features including swales connecting the pools described in paragraph (2)(ii) of this section, providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools; and

As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

![](/graphics/ec01jn91.174.gif)Family Polemoniaceae: *Ipomopsis polyantha* (Pagosa skyrocket)

(1) Critical habitat units are designated for Archuleta County, Colorado.

(2) The primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of *Ipomopsis polyantha* consist of five components:

(i) *Mancos shale soils.*

(ii) *Elevation and climate.* Elevations from 6,400 to 8,100 ft (1,950 to 2,475 m) and current climatic conditions similar to those that historically occurred around Pagosa Springs, Colorado. Climatic conditions include suitable precipitation; cold, dry springs; and winter snow.

(iii) *Plant community.*

(A) Suitable native plant communities (as described in paragraph (2)(iii)(B) of this entry) with small (less than 100 ft2 (10 m2)) or larger (several hectares or acres) barren areas with less than 20 percent plant cover in the actual barren areas.

(B) Appropriate native plant communities, preferably with plant communities reflective of historical community composition, or altered habitats which still contain components of native plant communities. These plant communities include:

(*1*) Barren shales;

(*2*) Open montane grassland (primarily Arizona fescue) understory at the edges of open Ponderosa pine; or

(*3*) Clearings within the ponderosa pine/Rocky Mountain juniper and Utah juniper/oak communities.

(iv) *Habitat for pollinators.*

(A) Pollinator ground and twig nesting areas. Nesting and foraging habitats suitable for a wide array of pollinators and their life-history and nesting requirements. A mosaic of native plant communities and habitat types generally would provide for this diversity.

(B) Connectivity between areas allowing pollinators to move from one site to the next within each plant population.

(C) Availability of other floral resources, such as other flowering plant species that provide nectar and pollen for pollinators. Grass species do not provide resources for pollinators.

(D) A 3,280-ft (1,000-m) area beyond occupied habitat to conserve the pollinators essential for plant reproduction.

(v) *Appropriate disturbance regime.*

(A) Appropriate disturbance levels - Light to moderate, or intermittent or discontinuous disturbances.

(B) Naturally maintained disturbances through soil erosion or human-maintained disturbances that can include light grazing, occasional ground clearing, and other disturbances that are not severe or continual.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on September 12, 2012. However, because *Ipomopsis polyantha* is found along the edges of roads and buildings, the edges of roads and edges of structures are included in the designation.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on a base of both aerial imagery (NAIP 2009) as well as USGS geospatial quadrangle maps and were mapped using NAD 83 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), zone 13N coordinates. Location information came from a wide array of sources. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public on *http://regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R6-ES-2011-0040, on our Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/species/plants/3ColoradoPlants/index.html*), and at the Western Colorado Ecological Services Office, 764 Horizon Drive, Suite B, Grand Junction, CO 81506-3946.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Diego Counties, California, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements (PCEs) for *Navarretia fossalis* consist of three components:

(i) PCE 1 - *Ephemeral wetland habitat.* Vernal pools (up to 10 ac (4 ha)) and seasonally flooded alkali vernal plains that become inundated by winter rains and hold water or have saturated soils for 2 weeks to 6 months during a year with average rainfall (*i.e.*, years where average rainfall amounts for a particular area are reached during the rainy season (between October and May)). This period of inundation is long enough to promote germination, flowering, and seed production for *Navarretia fossalis* and other native species typical of vernal pool and seasonally flooded alkali vernal plain habitat, but not so long that true wetland species inhabit the areas.

(ii) PCE 2 - *Intermixed wetland and upland habitats that act as the local watershed.* Areas characterized by mounds, swales, and depressions within a matrix of upland habitat that result in intermittently flowing surface and subsurface water in swales, drainages, and pools described in PCE 1.

(iii) PCE 3 - *Soils that support ponding during winter and spring.* Soils found in areas characterized in PCEs 1 and 2 that have a clay component or other property that creates an impermeable surface or subsurface layer. These soil types include, but are not limited to: Cieneba-Pismo-Caperton soils in Los Angeles County; Domino, Traver, Waukena, Chino, and Willows soils in Riverside County; and Huerhuero, Placentia, Olivenhain, Stockpen, and Redding soils in San Diego County.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one of more of the primary constituent elements, such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, and roads, and the land on which such structures are located.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created using a base of U.S. Geological Survey 7.5' quadrangle maps. Critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 11, North American Datum (NAD) 1983 coordinates.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Santa Cruz County, California, on the map below. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Chorizanthe robusta* var. *hartwegii* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Thin soils in the Bonnydoon series that have developed over outcrops of Santa Cruz mudstone and Purisima sandstone;

(ii) “Wildflower field” habitat that has developed on these thin-soiled sites;

(iii) A grassland plant community that supports the “wildflower field” habitat, that is stable over time and in which nonnative species are absent or are at a density that has little or no adverse effect on resources available for growth and reproduction of *Chorizanthe robusta* var. *hartwegii;*

(iv) Sufficient areas around each population to allow for recolonization to adjacent suitable microhabitat sites in the event of catastrophic events;

(v) Pollinator activity between existing colonies of *Chorizanthe robusta* var. *hartwegii;*

(vi) Seed dispersal mechanisms between existing colonies and other potentially suitable sites; and

(vii) Sufficient integrity of the watershed above habitat for *Chorizanthe robusta* var. *hartwegii* to maintain soil and hydrologic conditions that provide the seasonally wet substrate for growth and reproduction.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Santa Cruz County, California, on the maps below. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Chorizanthe robusta* var. *robusta* include, but are not limited to, the habitat components that provide:

(i) Sandy soils associated with active coastal dunes, coastal bluffs with a deposition of windblown sand, inland sites with sandy soils, and interior floodplain dunes;

(ii) Plant communities that support associated species, including coastal dune, coastal scrub, grassland, maritime chaparral, oak woodland, and interior floodplain dune communities, and have a structure such that there are openings between the dominant elements (e.g, scrub, shrub, oak trees, clumps of herbaceous vegetation);

(iii) Plant communities that contain no or little cover by nonnative species which would complete for resources available for growth and reproduction of *Chorizanthe robusta* var. *robusta*; and

(iv) Physical processes, such as occasional soil disturbance, that support natural dune dynamics along coastal areas.

(3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) The critical habitat unit is depicted for Benton County, Washington, on the map at paragraph (5) of this entry.

(2) The primary constituent elements of the physical and biological features essential to the conservation of *Eriogonum codium* are the following:

(i) North- to northeast-facing, weathered basalt cliffs of the Wanapum Formation at the eastern end of Umtanum Ridge in Benton County that contain outcrops, cliff breaks, slopes, and flat or gently sloping cliff tops with exposed pebble and gravel soils.

(ii) Pebbly lithosol talus soils derived from surface weathering of the top of the Lolo Flow of the Priest Rapids Member of the Wanapum Formation.

(iii) Sparsely vegetated habitat (less than 10 percent total cover), containing low amounts of nonnative or invasive plant species (less than 1 percent cover).

(iv) The presence of insect pollinator species.

(v) The presence of native shrub steppe habitat within the effective pollinator distance (300 m (approximately 980 ft)) around the population.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, pavement, or other structures) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on the effective date of this rule.

(4) This critical habitat unit was mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator, Zone 11, North American Datum 1983 (UTM NAD 83) coordinates. These coordinates establish the vertices of the unit boundaries. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which the map is based are available to the public at the field office Internet site (*http://www.fws.gov/wafwo/HanfordPlants/FLFCH.html*), *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R1-ES-2013-0012, and at the Service's Washington Fish and Wildlife Office.

(1) Critical habitat units for this species are found in San Bernardino County, California. The maps provided are for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Eriogonum kennedyi* var. *austromontanum* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Pebble plains in dry meadow-like openings within upper montane coniferous forest, pinyon-juniper woodlands, or Great Basin sagebrush in the San Bernardino Mountains of San Bernardino County, California; at elevations between 5,900 to 9,800 ft (1,830 to 2,990 m) that provide space for individual and population growth, reproduction and dispersal; and

(ii) Seasonally wet clay, or sandy clay soils, generally containing quartzite pebbles, subject to natural hydrological processes that include water hydrating the soil and freezing in winter and drying in summer causing lifting and churning of included pebbles, that provide space for individual and population growth, reproduction and dispersal, adequate water, air, minerals, and other nutritional or physiological requirements to the species.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) Critical habitat map units. Data layers defining map units were created on a base of USGS 1:24,0000 maps, and critical habitat units were then mapped using Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.

![](/graphics/er26de07.028.gif)Family Polygonaceae: *Eriogonum ovalifolium* var. *vineum* (Cushenbury buckwheat)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Bernardino County, California, on the map below. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Eriogonum ovalifolium* var. *vineum* are those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of the species. Based on our current knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements of critical habitat for this species are listed below and consist of, but are not limited to:

(i) Soils derived primarily from the upper and middle members of the Bird Spring Formation and Bonanza King Formation parent materials that occur on hillsides at elevations between 1,400 and 2,400 m (4,600 and 7,900 ft);

(ii) Soils with intact, natural surfaces that have not been substantially altered by land use activities (e.g., graded, excavated, re-contoured, or otherwise altered by ground-disturbing equipment); and

(iii) Associated plant communities that have areas with an open canopy cover (generally less than 15 percent cover) and little accumulation of organic material (e.g., leaf litter) on the surface of the soil.

(3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, active mines, paved or unpaved roads, other paved or cleared areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, are not likely to contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they may affect the species or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for San Bernardino County, California, on the map below. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Oxytheca parishii* var. *goodmaniana* are those habitat components that are essential for the primary biological needs of the species. Based on our current knowledge of this species, the primary constituent elements of critical habitat for this species are listed below and consist of, but are not limited to:

(i) Soils derived primarily from upslope limestone, a mixture of limestone and dolomite, or limestone talus substrates with parent materials that include Bird Spring Formation, Bonanza King Formation, middle and lower members of the Monte Cristo Limestone, and the Crystal Pass member of the Sultan Limestone Formation at elevations between 1,440 and 2,372 m (4,724 and 7,782 ft);

(ii) Soils with intact, natural surfaces that have not been substantially altered by land use activities (e.g., graded, excavated, re-contoured, or otherwise altered by ground-disturbing equipment); and

(iii) Associated plant communities that have areas with a moderately open canopy cover (generally between 25 and 53 percent (Neel 2000)).

(3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, active mines, paved or unpaved roads, other paved or cleared areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, are not likely to contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a section 7 consultation, unless they may affect the species or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Santa Cruz County, California, on the map below. The map provided is for informational purposes only.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Polygonum hickmanii* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Thin soils in the Bonnydoon series that have developed over outcrops of Santa Cruz mudstone and Purisima sandstone;

(ii) “Wildflower field” habitat that has developed on these thin-soiled sites;

(iii) A grassland plant community that supports the “wildflower field” habitat and that supports the pollinator activity and seed dispersal mechanisms that typically occur within the grassland plant community;

(iv) Areas around each colony to allow for recolonization to adjacent suitable microhabitat sites; and

(v) Habitat within the subwatersheds upslope to the ridgelines to maintain the edaphic and hydrologic conditions and slope stability that provide the seasonally wet substrate for growth and reproduction of *Polygonum hickmanii.*

(3) Existing features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas, do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.

![](/graphics/ec01jn91.179.gif)Family Rosaceae: *Ivesia webberi* (Webber's ivesia)

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Plumas, Lassen, and Sierra Counties, California, and Washoe and Douglas Counties, Nevada, on the maps below.

(2) Within these areas, the primary constituent elements of the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of *Ivesia webberi* consist of four components:

(i) *Plant community.*

(A) Open to sparsely vegetated areas composed of generally short-statured associated plant species.

(B) Presence of appropriate associated species that can include (but are not limited to): *Antennaria dimorpha, Artemisia arbuscula, Balsamorhiza hookeri, Elymus elymoides, Erigeron bloomeri, Lewisia rediviva, Poa secunda,* and *Viola beckwithii.*

(C) An intact assemblage of appropriate associated species to attract the floral visitors that may be acting as pollinators of *Ivesia webberi.*

(ii) *Topography.* Flats, benches, or terraces that are generally above or adjacent to large valleys. Occupied sites vary from slightly concave to slightly convex or gently sloped (0-15°) and occur on all aspects.

(iii) *Elevation.* Elevations between 4,475 and 6,237 feet (1,364 and 1,901 meters).

(iv) *Suitable soils and hydrology.*

(A) Vernally moist soils with an argillic horizon that shrink and swell upon drying and wetting; these soil conditions are characteristic of known *Ivesia webberi* populations and are likely important in the maintenance of the seedbank and population recruitment.

(B) Suitable soils that can include (but are not limited to): Reno - a fine, smectitic, mesic Abruptic Xeric Argidurid; Xman - a clayey, smectitic, mesic, shallow Xeric Haplargids; Aldi - a clayey, smectitic, frigid Lithic Ultic Argixerolls; and Barshaad - a fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Palexeroll.

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, runways, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing within the legal boundaries on July 3, 2014.

(4) *Critical habitat map units.* Data layers defining map units were created on the base of both satellite imagery (ESRI ArcGIS Imagery Basemap) as well as USGS geospatial quadrangle maps and were mapped using NAD 83 Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM), zone 11N coordinates. The maps in this entry, as modified by any accompanying regulatory text, establish the boundaries of the critical habitat designation. The coordinates or plot points or both on which each map is based are available to the public at *http://www.regulations.gov* at Docket No. FWS-R8-ES-2013-0080, and at the field office responsible for this designation (i.e., Nevada Fish and Wildlife Office (*http://www.fws.gov/nevada/*)).

(1) Critical habitat is depicted on the map below for Halfpenny Bay, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.

(2) The primary constituent elements (PCEs) of critical habitat for *Catesbaea melanocarpa* are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Single-layered canopy forest with little ground cover and open forest floor that supports patches of dry vegetation with grasses, and

(ii) Well to excessively drained limestone and serpentine-derived soils (including soils of the San Germán, Nipe, and Rosario series and Glynn and Hogensborg series).

(3) Critical habitat does not include manmade structures (such as buildings, aqueducts, airports, roads, and other paved areas) and the land on which they are located existing on the effective date of this rule and not containing one or more of the primary constituent elements.

(4) *Critical habitat map.* Data layers were created by overlaying habitats that contain at least two of the PCEs, as defined in paragraph (2) of this section, on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topographic maps (UTM 20, NAD 27).

(5) Critical Habitat unit: Halfpenny Bay, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.

(i) *General description:* The Halfpenny Bay unit consists of approximately 10.5 ac (4.3 ha) on privately owned property located about 2.48 mi (4 km) south of Christiansted, St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. The designated unit is located east of South Shore Road, approximately 342 m (1,122 ft) south of Road 62, approximately 600 m (1,968 ft) north of the Halfpenny Bay coast, and 70 m (230 ft) west of a local road to Halfpenny Bay. This unit encompasses the habitat features essential to the conservation of *Catesbaea melanocarpa* within Estate Granard, Christiansted, St. Croix, and does not contain any manmade structures.

(1) Critical habitat units are depicted for Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, and Tuolumne Counties, California, on the map below.

(2) The primary constituent elements of critical habitat for *Castilleja campestris* ssp. *succulenta* (Fleshy owl's-clover) are the habitat components that provide:

(i) Topographic features characterized by isolated mound and intermound complex within a matrix of surrounding uplands that result in continuously, or intermittently, flowing surface water in the depressional features including swales connecting the pools described in paragraph (2)(ii) of this section, providing for dispersal and promoting hydroperiods of adequate length in the pools; and

(ii) Depressional features including isolated vernal pools with underlying restrictive soil layers that become inundated during winter rains and that continuously hold water or whose soils are saturated for a period long enough to promote germination, flowering, and seed production of predominantly annual native wetland species and typically exclude both native and nonnative upland plant species in all but the driest years. As these features are inundated on a seasonal basis, they do not promote the development of obligate wetland vegetation habitats typical of permanently flooded emergent wetlands.

(3) Existing manmade features and structures, such as buildings, roads, railroads, airports, runways, other paved areas, lawns, and other urban landscaped areas do not contain one or more of the primary constituent elements. Federal actions limited to those areas, therefore, would not trigger a consultation under section 7 of the Act unless they may affect the species and/or primary constituent elements in adjacent critical habitat.
