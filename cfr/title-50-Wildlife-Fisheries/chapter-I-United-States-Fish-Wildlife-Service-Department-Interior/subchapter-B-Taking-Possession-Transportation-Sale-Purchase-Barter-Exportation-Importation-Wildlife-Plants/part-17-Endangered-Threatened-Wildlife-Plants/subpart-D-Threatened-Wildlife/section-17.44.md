(p) Kentucky arrow darter (*Etheostoma spilotum*).

(1) *Prohibitions.* Except as noted in paragraph (p)(2) of this section, all prohibitions and provisions of 50 CFR 17.31 and 17.32 apply to the Kentucky arrow darter.

(2) *Exceptions from prohibitions.*

(i) All of the activities listed in paragraph (p)(2)(ii) of this section must be conducted in a manner that:

(A) Maintains connectivity of suitable Kentucky arrow darter habitats, allowing for dispersal between streams;

(B) Minimizes instream disturbance by occurring during low-flow periods when possible; and

(C) Maximizes the amount of instream cover that is available for the species.

(ii) Incidental take of the Kentucky arrow darter will not be considered a violation of section 9 of the Act if the take results from any of the following when conducted within habitats currently occupied by the Kentucky arrow darter:

(A) Channel reconfiguration or restoration projects that create natural, physically stable, ecologically functioning streams (or stream and wetland systems) that are reconnected with their groundwater aquifers. These projects can be accomplished using a variety of methods, but the desired outcome is a natural, sinuous channel with low shear stress (force of water moving against the channel); low bank heights and reconnection to the floodplain; a reconnection of surface and groundwater systems, resulting in perennial flows in the channel; riffles and pools composed of existing soil, rock, and wood instead of large imported materials; low compaction of soils within adjacent riparian areas; and inclusion of riparian wetlands. First- to third-order headwater streams reconstructed in this way would offer suitable habitats for the Kentucky arrow darter and contain stable channel features, such as pools, glides, runs, and riffles, which could be used by the species for spawning, rearing, growth, feeding, migration, and other normal behaviors.

(B) Bank stabilization projects that use State-approved bioengineering methods (specified by the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet and the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet) to replace preexisting, bare, eroding stream banks with vegetated, stable stream banks, thereby reducing bank erosion and instream sedimentation and improving habitat conditions for the species. Following these methods, stream banks may be stabilized using live stakes (live, vegetative cuttings inserted or tamped into the ground in a manner that allows the stake to take root and grow), live fascines (live branch cuttings, usually willows, bound together into long, cigar-shaped bundles), or brush layering (cuttings or branches of easily rooted tree species layered between successive lifts of soil fill). These methods would not include the sole use of quarried rock (rip-rap) or the use of rock baskets or gabion structures.

(C) Bridge and culvert replacement/removal projects that remove migration barriers (e.g., collapsing, blocked, or perched culverts) or generally allow for improved upstream and downstream movements of Kentucky arrow darters while maintaining normal stream flows, preventing bed and bank erosion, and improving habitat conditions for the species.

(D) Repair and maintenance of U.S. Forest Service concrete plank stream crossings on the Daniel Boone National Forest (DBNF) that allow for safe vehicle passage while maintaining instream habitats, reducing bank and stream bed erosion and instream sedimentation, and improving habitat conditions for the species. These concrete plank crossings have been an effective stream crossing structure on the DBNF and have been used for decades. Over time, the planks can be buried by sediment, undercut during storm events, or simply break down and decay. If these situations occur, the DBNF must make repairs or replace the affected plank.

(q) [Reserved]

(r) Pecos bluntnose shiner (*Notropis simus pecosensis*). (1) No person shall take the species, except in accordance with applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws and regulations in the following instances:

(i) For educational purposes, scientific purposes, the enhancement of propagation or survival of the species, zoological exhibition, and other conservation purposes consistent with the Act; or,

(ii) Incidental to State permitted recreational fishing activities, provided that the individual fish taken is immediately returned to its habitat.

(2) Any violation of applicable State fish and wildlife conservation laws or regulations with respect to taking of this species will also be a violation of the Endangered Species Act.

(E) Any relevant aquaculture facility located outside of a littoral state has complied with all of the requirements shown in paragraph (y)(5) of this section.

(ii) *Personal and household effects.* You may import, export, or re-export, or conduct interstate or foreign commerce in beluga sturgeon specimens that qualify as personal or household effects under 50 CFR part 23 without a threatened species permit otherwise required under § 17.32. Trade suspensions or trade restrictions administratively imposed by the Service under paragraphs (y)(6) or (y)(7) of this section may also apply to personal and household effects of beluga sturgeon caviar.

(4) *What must beluga sturgeon littoral states do to be authorized under the special rule to export to the United States?* The following requirements apply to the littoral states wishing to export beluga caviar or beluga meat to the United States without the need for a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32. These requirements apply to all shipments of beluga caviar and beluga meat that originate in the littoral states, even if the shipments are re-exported to the United States via an intermediary country. (*See* paragraph (y)(7) of this section for more information on the Service's biennial reviews under the special rule.)

(i) *Basin-wide beluga sturgeon management plans.* By September 6, 2005, each littoral state wishing to export beluga caviar or beluga meat to the United States without the need for a threatened species permit issued under § 17.32 must submit to the Service's Division of Scientific Authority a copy of a cooperative management plan for its respective basin (*i.e.*, Black Sea or Caspian Sea) that addresses *Huso huso* conservation. Each of these two basin-wide management plans must be agreed to by all of the littoral states (not just exporting nations) in the Black Sea or the Caspian Sea, as appropriate. Upon receipt, the Division of Scientific Authority will review these basin-wide management plans within 90 days for completeness and clarity. If any elements of the management plans are missing or unclear, we will ask the appropriate littoral states to provide additional information within 60 days of the date we contact them. If the littoral states fail to respond or fail to submit basin-wide management plans by the specified deadline, or if we are unable to confirm that all littoral states are signatories to those plans, we will immediately suspend trade with all littoral states in the given basin (Caspian Sea or Black Sea) until we are satisfied that such management plans exist. Submission of documents in English may help expedite the Service's review. These cooperative management plans must contain the following elements:

(A) A clear statement of the recovery and management objectives of the plan, including a specification of the stock(s) concerned, a definition of what constitutes over-fishing for that stock, and a rebuilding objective and schedule for that stock;

(B) A statement of standard regulations and habitat improvement strategies (e.g., size limits, target harvest rates, quotas, seasons, fishing gear, effort caps, fish passage improvement, water quality controls) to be utilized by the nations involved;

(C) A complete statement of the specific regulatory, monitoring, and research requirements that each cooperating nation must implement to be in compliance with the management plan;

(D) A complete description of how stock survey data and fisheries data are used to establish annual catch and export quotas, including a full explanation of any models used and the assumptions underlying those models;

(E) Procedures under which the nations may implement and enforce alternative management measures that achieve the same conservation benefits for beluga sturgeon as the standards mentioned in paragraph (y)(4)(i)(B) of this section; and

(F) A complete schedule by which nations must take particular actions to be in compliance with the plan.

(ii) *National regulations.* By September 6, 2005, each littoral state wishing to export beluga caviar or beluga meat to the United States under this special rule must provide the Service's Division of Scientific Authority with copies of national legislation and regulations that implement the basin-wide cooperative management plan described in paragraph (y)(4)(i) of this section, including regulations pertaining to the harvest, trade, aquaculture, restocking, and processing of beluga sturgeon. Upon receipt, the Division of Scientific Authority will review these national laws and regulations within 90 days for completeness and clarity. If any elements of the national legislation or national fishery regulations are missing or unclear, we will ask the appropriate littoral states to provide additional information within 60 days of the date we contact them. If the littoral states fail to respond or fail to submit copies of national laws and regulations by the specified deadline, we will immediately suspend trade with the given littoral states until we are satisfied that such laws and regulations are in effect. Submission of documents in English may help expedite the Service's review.

(iii) *CITES compliance.* Trade in beluga sturgeon specimens must comply with CITES requirements in 50 CFR part 23. Except for specimens that qualify as personal or household effects under 50 CFR part 23, all beluga sturgeon specimens, including those exempted from threatened species permits under this special rule, must be accompanied by valid CITES documents upon import, export, or re-export. Beluga sturgeon caviar, including beluga sturgeon caviar in interstate commerce in the United States, must be labeled in accordance with the CITES labeling requirements in 50 CFR part 23.

(iv) *Initial reporting period.* Until September 6, 2005, no threatened species permits will be required for the import, export, re-export, or interstate or foreign commerce of beluga sturgeon caviar and meat that originated in the littoral states, in order to provide the littoral states time to submit the required documentation. After this 6-month period, the exemption from threatened species permits will continue only while the Service reviews littoral state compliance with paragraphs (y)(4)(i) through (iv) of this section. If this review demonstrates that the provisions of this special rule are not met, the Service will announce and institute trade restrictions or suspensions in beluga sturgeon caviar or meat with one or more littoral states as per paragraph (y)(7) of this section.

(v) *Biennial reports.* Littoral state governments wishing to export specimens of beluga sturgeon caviar or meat to the United States under this special rule must provide to the Service's Division of Scientific Authority reports containing the most recent information available on the status of the species, following the information guidelines specified below. The Service must receive the first report no later than December 1, 2005, and every 2 years thereafter on the anniversary of that date. Starting in December 2005, and thereafter on a biennial basis, the Service will review the national reports within 90 days of receiving them and any other pertinent information on wild beluga sturgeon conservation. If any elements of the biennial reports are missing or unclear, the Service will ask the appropriate littoral states to provide additional information within 60 days of the date we contact them. If the littoral states fail to respond or fail to submit biennial reports by the specified deadline, we will immediately suspend trade with the given littoral states (*see* paragraph (y)(7) of this section for details on how such a suspension would be instituted and announced). Submission of documents in English may help expedite the Service's review. We propose to use these reviews to determine whether littoral state management programs are leading to recovery of wild beluga sturgeon stocks. For each littoral state, the following information must be provided in the biennial reports:

(A) A description of the specific fishery regulations that affect the harvest of *Huso huso* in the respective littoral state, with any changes from the previous report highlighted;

(B) A description of any revisions to the cooperative management program mentioned in paragraph (y)(4)(i) of this section, including any new models, assumptions, or equations used to set harvest and export quotas;

(C) New information obtained in the last 2 years on beluga sturgeon distribution, stock size, models used for quota-setting, spawning activity, habitat use, hatchery programs and results, or other relevant subjects;

(D) A summary of law enforcement activities undertaken in the last 2 years, and a description of any changes in programs to prevent poaching and smuggling, including indicators of their effectiveness;

(E) A summary of the revenues generated by the commercial exploitation of beluga sturgeon in the respective littoral state, and a summary of any documented conservation benefits resulting from the commercial harvest program in that country (e.g., revenues allocated to hatchery and restocking programs or research programs); and

(F) Export data for the previous two calendar years.

(5) *Can aquacultured beluga sturgeon products be exempt from threatened species permits if the products originate outside the littoral states?* We will consider exemptions from threatened species permits for beluga caviar and meat obtained from aquaculture facilities outside the littoral states. These exemptions will be for individual facilities, and would allow aquacultured beluga caviar and meat originating from these facilities to be imported, exported, re-exported, or traded in interstate and foreign commerce without threatened species permits issued under Section 10 of the Act. Aquaculture facilities within the United States could also be exempt from prohibitions against take for purposes of harvesting caviar or meat (*i.e.*, killing of beluga sturgeon), or for conducting activities involving research to enhance the survival or propagation of the species. Facilities outside the littoral states wishing to obtain such exemptions must submit a written request to the Division of Management Authority at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b) and provide information that shows, at a minimum, all of the following:

(i) The facility in question is using best management practices to prevent the escape of beluga sturgeon and disease pathogens into local ecosystems, as certified by the relevant regulatory agency. In the case of the United States, the relevant regulatory authority will be the state agency with jurisdiction over aquaculture. In the case of foreign aquaculture facilities outside the littoral states, the relevant regulatory agency will be the designated CITES Management Authority with jurisdiction over sturgeon. Best management practices that affect the applicant's facility must be part of the application and available for Service review.

(ii) The facility in question has entered into a formal agreement with one or more littoral states to study, protect, or otherwise enhance the survival of wild beluga sturgeon. Copies of such agreements must be provided.

(iii) The facility in question does not rely on wild beluga sturgeon for broodstock. Proof of broodstock origin, including relevant CITES permits that accompanied broodstock specimens upon import into the United States, must be part of the application.

(iv) Exemptions granted under paragraph (y)(5) of this section shall not apply to trade (import, export, re-export, or interstate and foreign commerce) in live beluga sturgeon, and may be revoked at any time if the Service determines that any of the criteria shown in paragraphs (y)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section are not met by the facility. Applicants will be required to submit biennial reports on their compliance with paragraphs (y)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section, starting on the second anniversary of any programmatic exemption granted to the applicants. These biennial reports must show that exempted facilities have actively cooperated with one or more littoral states in a meaningful way to support beluga sturgeon conservation. Any beluga caviar originating from aquaculture facilities outside the littoral states must comply with CITES caviar-labeling requirements, even in interstate commerce within the United States. We will publish an information notice if the Service grants a programmatic exemption to any aquaculture facility outside the littoral states, and announce such actions through our website and posting notices at our wildlife ports of entry. We will follow the provisions of paragraph (y)(7) of this section to announce restrictions or revocations of such programmatic exemptions, based on our review of facilities' biennial reports.

(6) *How will the Service inform the public of CITES restrictions on trade in beluga sturgeon?* We will issue a public bulletin that identifies a restriction or suspension of trade in specimens of beluga sturgeon and post it on our websites (*http://le.fws.gov* and *http://international.fws.gov*) and at our staffed wildlife ports of entry if any criterion in paragraphs (y)(6)(i) or (ii) of this section is met:

(i) The country is lacking a designated Management Authority or Scientific Authority for the issuance of valid CITES documents or their equivalent for beluga sturgeon.

(ii) The country is identified in any action adopted by the CITES Conference of the Parties, the CITES Standing Committee, or in a Notification to the Parties issued by the CITES Secretariat as a country from which Parties are asked not to accept shipments of specimens of beluga sturgeon or all CITES-listed species.

Note to paragraph (y)(6):

A listing of all countries that have not designated either a Management Authority or Scientific Authority, or that have been identified as countries from which Parties should not accept permits, is available by writing to the Division of Management Authority at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).

(7) *How will the Service set trade restrictions or prohibitions under the special rule?* The Service's Division of Scientific Authority will conduct a biennial review of beluga sturgeon conservation based on information in the cooperative basin-wide management plans, national regulations and laws, and biennial reports (submitted as per paragraph (y)(4) of this section, and, for aquaculture facilities, as per paragraph (y)(5)(iv) of this section). We will combine that review with a review of other relevant information (e.g., scientific literature, law enforcement data, government-to-government consultations) to determine whether littoral state management programs and aquaculture operations are effectively achieving conservation benefits for beluga sturgeon. Based on this information, or the failure to obtain it, the Service may restrict or prohibit trade from a littoral state, a re-exporting intermediary country, or an entire basin (*i.e.*, the Caspian Sea or Black Sea) or a specific aquaculture facility outside the littoral states if we determine that the conservation or management status of beluga sturgeon has been adversely affected and the continued recovery of beluga sturgeon may be compromised. The decision to restrict or prohibit trade in beluga sturgeon products on a national, basin, or region-wide scale will depend on the scope of the problem observed, the magnitude of the threat to wild beluga sturgeon, and whether remedial action is necessary at a national, basin, or region-wide scale.

(i) Trade restrictions or suspensions will result basin-wide, for specific littoral states, or for non-littoral state aquaculture facilities under one or more of the following scenarios:

(A) Failure to submit any of the reports, legislation, and management plans described in paragraph (y)(4) of this section, or failure to respond to requests for additional information;

(B) A change in regional cooperative management that threatens the recovery of wild beluga sturgeon;

(C) A change in littoral state laws or regulations that compromises beluga sturgeon recovery or survival in the wild;

(D) Adoption of scientifically unsound hatchery practices or restocking programs for beluga sturgeon;

(E) A decline in wild *Huso huso* populations, as documented in national reports outlined above or the scientific literature, that goes unaddressed by regional or national management programs;

(F) Failure to address poaching or smuggling in beluga sturgeon, their parts, or products in the littoral states or re-exporting countries, as documented in national reports described above or other law enforcement sources;

(G) Failure of the littoral states to address the loss of beluga sturgeon habitat quality or quantity;

(H) Failure of the littoral states or re-exporting countries to follow the caviar-labeling recommendations of the CITES Parties (currently embodied in Resolution Conf. 12.7);

(I) Recommendations from the CITES Standing Committee to suspend trade in beluga sturgeon from one or more countries; or

(J) An aquaculture facility outside the littoral states has been issued a programmatic exemption from threatened species permits under paragraph (y)(5) of this section, but is not abiding by the provisions of paragraphs (y)(5)(i) through (iii) of this section, or, based on the biennial reports required under paragraph (y)(5) of this section, has not actively cooperated with one or more littoral states in a meaningful way to support beluga sturgeon conservation.

(K) Any other natural or human-induced phenomenon that threatens the survival or recovery of beluga sturgeon.

(ii) We will publish an information notice in the Federal Register, as well as on our Web site and at our wildlife ports of entry, if the Service's Division of Scientific Authority administratively suspends or restricts trade in beluga sturgeon products after determining that wild beluga sturgeon stock status worsens or threats to the species increase. This information notice will provide:

(A) The problem(s) identified in the biennial reports or other salient documents.

(B) The scope of the problem and the number of nations involved.

(C) The scope of the trade restriction or suspension we are imposing, including products covered, duration of the restriction or suspension, and criteria for lifting it and reinstating any exemption to threatened species permits.

(D) How the public can provide input, make comments, and recommend remedial action to withdraw the trade measures imposed.

(z) Gila trout (*Oncorhynchus gilae*). (1) Except as noted in paragraph (z)(2) of this section, all prohibitions of 50 CFR 17.31 and exemptions of 50 CFR 17.32 apply to the Gila trout.
