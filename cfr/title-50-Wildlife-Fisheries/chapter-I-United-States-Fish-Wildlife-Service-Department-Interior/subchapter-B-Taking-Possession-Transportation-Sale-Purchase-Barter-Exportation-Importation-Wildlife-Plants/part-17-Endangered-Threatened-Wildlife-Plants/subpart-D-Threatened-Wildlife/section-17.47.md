##### § 17.47 Special rules - insects. #####

(a) Cassius blue butterfly (*Leptotes cassius theonus*), Ceraunus blue butterfly (*Hemiargus ceraunus antibubastus*), and Nickerbean blue butterfly (*Cyclargus ammon*).

(1) The provisions of § 17.31(c) apply to these species (cassius blue butterfly, ceraunus blue butterfly, nickerbean blue butterfly), regardless of whether in the wild or in captivity, and also apply to the progeny of any such butterfly.

(2) Any violation of State law will also be a violation of the Act.

(3) Incidental take, that is, take that results from, but is not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity, will not apply to the cassius blue butterfly, ceraunus blue butterfly, and nickerbean blue butterfly.

(4) Collection of the cassius blue butterfly, ceraunus blue butterfly, and nickerbean blue butterfly is prohibited in coastal counties south of Interstate 4 and extending to the boundaries of the State of Florida at the endpoints of Interstate 4 at Tampa and Daytona Beach. Specifically, such activities are prohibited in the following counties: Brevard, Broward, Charlotte, Collier, De Soto, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lee, Manatee, Pinellas, Sarasota, St. Lucie, Martin, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, and Volusia.

(b) Dakota skipper (*Hesperia dacotae*). (1) *Which populations of the Dakota skipper are covered by this special rule?* This rule covers the distribution of Dakota skipper in the United States.

(2) *Prohibitions.* Except as noted in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all prohibitions and provisions of §§ 17.31 and 17.32 apply to the Dakota skipper.

(3) *Exemptions from prohibitions.* Incidental take of Dakota skipper will not be a violation of section 9 of the Act if it occurs as a result of the following activities (except where explicitly stated otherwise, these activities must be associated with livestock ranching):

(i) *Fence construction and maintenance.*

(ii) *Livestock gathering and management.* The installation and maintenance of corrals, loading chutes, and other livestock working facilities must be carefully sited with respect to the location and distribution of important Dakota skipper habitat.

(iii) *Development and maintenance of livestock watering facilities.*

(iv) *Noxious weed control.* Incidental take of Dakota skipper that results from spraying of herbicides is not a violation of section 9 of the Act, except such take that results from broadcast spraying, which is the application of herbicides evenly across the entire application area. Incidental take that results from mowing to control one or more noxious weed species would also not be a violation of section 9 of the Act.

(v) *Haying.* For the purposes of this rule, native haylands do not include lands that had previously been plowed and were then replanted to native or nonnative vegetation, but native haylands do include areas within transportation (e.g., road, highway, railroad) rights-of-ways and corridors where native grasses are mowed for hay. Haying of native haylands no earlier than July 16 (after July 15) would not be a violation of section 9 of the Act. Mowing of replanted grasslands (grasslands replanted on formerly plowed or cultivated lands) or tame haylands or grasslands (planted hayland or grassland comprising primarily nonnative grass species, such as smooth brome (*Bromus inermis inermis*)) would also not be a violation of section 9 of the Act at any time of the year.

(vi) *Mowing section line rights-of-way and recreational trails.* Mowing of section line rights-of-way (typically disturbed soil that has been contoured for a roadway) would not be a violation of section 9 of the Act. Mowing of recreational trails (travelways established either through construction or use that are intended for and passable by foot traffic, bicycles, in-line skates, wheelchairs, or cross-country skis) would not be a violation of section 9 of the Act, regardless of whether the trails are associated with livestock ranching.

(vii) *Livestock (cattle, bison, or horse) grazing on private, State, or tribal land.*

(c) Western glacier stonefly (*Zapada glacier*) and meltwater lednian stonefly (*Lednia tumana*) - (1) *Prohibitions.* The following prohibitions that apply to endangered wildlife also apply to western glacier stonefly and meltwater lednian stonefly except as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and §§ 17.4 and 17.5. It is unlawful for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to commit, to attempt to commit, to solicit another to commit, or cause to be committed, any of the following acts in regard to these species:

(i) Import or export, as set forth at § 17.21(b).

(ii) Take, as set forth at § 17.21(c)(1).

(iii) Possession and other acts with unlawfully taken specimens, as set forth at § 17.21(d)(1).

(iv) Interstate or foreign commerce in the course of commercial activity, as set forth at § 17.21(e).

(v) Sale or offer for sale, as set forth at § 17.21(f).

(i) Conduct activities as authorized by a permit under § 17.32.

(ii) Take, as set forth at § 17.21(c)(3) and (4) for endangered wildlife.

(iii) Possess and engage in other acts, as set forth at § 17.21(d)(2) for endangered wildlife.

(iv) In addition to any other provisions of this part, any employee or agent of the Service, of the National Marine Fisheries Service, or of a State conservation agency that is operating a conservation program pursuant to the terms of a cooperative agreement with the Service in accordance with section 6(c) of the Act, who is designated by that agency for such purposes, may, when acting in the course of official duties, take those threatened species of wildlife that are covered by an approved cooperative agreement to carry out conservation programs.

(d) American burying beetle (*Nicrophorus americanus*) - (1) *Prohibitions.* The following prohibitions apply to the American burying beetle:

(i) *Take of the American burying beetle.* Take of the American burying beetle, except that take that is incidental to otherwise lawful activity (incidental take) is prohibited only when the take occurs on suitable American burying beetle habitat:

(A) In the New England and Northern Plains Analysis Areas where the incidental take results from soil disturbance; or

(B) In the Southern Plains Analysis Areas where the incidental take occurs on defined conservation lands, except where incidental take is in compliance with a Service-approved conservation plan.

(ii) *Possession and other acts with unlawfully taken American burying beetles.* It is unlawful to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship, by any means whatsoever, any American burying beetle that was taken in violation of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section or State law. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Federal and State law enforcement officers may possess, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any American burying beetle taken in violation of the Act as necessary in performing their official duties.

(iii) *Import and export of the American burying beetle.* It is unlawful to import or export the American burying beetle.

(ii) Federal or State government agencies may incidentally take American burying beetles when conducting wildlife management activities in the Northern Plains Analysis Areas.

(iii) Incidental take of American burying beetles resulting from ranching and grazing activities is allowed.

(ii) *New England Analysis Area* means Block Island in Rhode Island and Nantucket Island in Massachusetts.

(iii) *Northern Plains Analysis Areas* means portions of Nebraska and South Dakota, as presented in the map at paragraph (d)(4) of this section, to initially include an 18.6-mile buffer around each capture location to determine the outside boundaries of the analysis area. For specific information regarding whether a parcel of land is inside the Northern Plains Analysis Areas, contact your local Service ecological services field office. Field office contact information may be obtained from the Service regional offices, the addresses of which are listed at 50 CFR 2.2.

(iv) *Ranching and grazing* means activities involved in grazing livestock (e.g., cattle, bison, horse, sheep, goats, or other grazing animals) such as: Gathering of livestock; construction and maintenance of fences associated with livestock grazing; installation and maintenance of corrals, loading chutes, and other livestock working facilities; development and maintenance of livestock watering facilities; placement of supplements such as salt blocks for grazing livestock; and, when associated with livestock grazing, the control of noxious weeds, haying, mowing, and prescribed burning. Ranching and grazing does not include any form of farming, conversion of grassland to cropland, or management of cropland.
