(a) Cassius blue butterfly (*Leptotes cassius theonus*), Ceraunus blue butterfly (*Hemiargus ceraunus antibubastus*), and Nickerbean blue butterfly (*Cyclargus ammon*).

(1) The provisions of § 17.31(c) apply to these species (cassius blue butterfly, ceraunus blue butterfly, nickerbean blue butterfly), regardless of whether in the wild or in captivity, and also apply to the progeny of any such butterfly.

(2) Any violation of State law will also be a violation of the Act.

(3) Incidental take, that is, take that results from, but is not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity, will not apply to the cassius blue butterfly, ceraunus blue butterfly, and nickerbean blue butterfly.

(4) Collection of the cassius blue butterfly, ceraunus blue butterfly, and nickerbean blue butterfly is prohibited in coastal counties south of Interstate 4 and extending to the boundaries of the State of Florida at the endpoints of Interstate 4 at Tampa and Daytona Beach. Specifically, such activities are prohibited in the following counties: Brevard, Broward, Charlotte, Collier, De Soto, Hillsborough, Indian River, Lee, Manatee, Pinellas, Sarasota, St. Lucie, Martin, Miami-Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, and Volusia.

(b) Dakota skipper (*Hesperia dacotae*). (1) *Which populations of the Dakota skipper are covered by this special rule?* This rule covers the distribution of Dakota skipper in the United States.

(2) *Prohibitions.* Except as noted in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, all prohibitions and provisions of §§ 17.31 and 17.32 apply to the Dakota skipper.

(3) *Exemptions from prohibitions.* Incidental take of Dakota skipper will not be a violation of section 9 of the Act if it occurs as a result of the following activities (except where explicitly stated otherwise, these activities must be associated with livestock ranching):

(i) *Fence construction and maintenance.*

(ii) *Livestock gathering and management.* The installation and maintenance of corrals, loading chutes, and other livestock working facilities must be carefully sited with respect to the location and distribution of important Dakota skipper habitat.

(iii) *Development and maintenance of livestock watering facilities.*

(iv) *Noxious weed control.* Incidental take of Dakota skipper that results from spraying of herbicides is not a violation of section 9 of the Act, except such take that results from broadcast spraying, which is the application of herbicides evenly across the entire application area. Incidental take that results from mowing to control one or more noxious weed species would also not be a violation of section 9 of the Act.

(v) *Haying.* For the purposes of this rule, native haylands do not include lands that had previously been plowed and were then replanted to native or nonnative vegetation, but native haylands do include areas within transportation (e.g., road, highway, railroad) rights-of-ways and corridors where native grasses are mowed for hay. Haying of native haylands no earlier than July 16 (after July 15) would not be a violation of section 9 of the Act. Mowing of replanted grasslands (grasslands replanted on formerly plowed or cultivated lands) or tame haylands or grasslands (planted hayland or grassland comprising primarily nonnative grass species, such as smooth brome (*Bromus inermis inermis*)) would also not be a violation of section 9 of the Act at any time of the year.

(vi) *Mowing section line rights-of-way and recreational trails.* Mowing of section line rights-of-way (typically disturbed soil that has been contoured for a roadway) would not be a violation of section 9 of the Act. Mowing of recreational trails (travelways established either through construction or use that are intended for and passable by foot traffic, bicycles, in-line skates, wheelchairs, or cross-country skis) would not be a violation of section 9 of the Act, regardless of whether the trails are associated with livestock ranching.

(vii) *Livestock (cattle, bison, or horse) grazing on private, State, or tribal land.*

(c) Western glacier stonefly (*Zapada glacier*) and meltwater lednian stonefly (*Lednia tumana*) - (1) *Prohibitions.* The following prohibitions that apply to endangered wildlife also apply to western glacier stonefly and meltwater lednian stonefly except as provided under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and §§ 17.4 and 17.5.
