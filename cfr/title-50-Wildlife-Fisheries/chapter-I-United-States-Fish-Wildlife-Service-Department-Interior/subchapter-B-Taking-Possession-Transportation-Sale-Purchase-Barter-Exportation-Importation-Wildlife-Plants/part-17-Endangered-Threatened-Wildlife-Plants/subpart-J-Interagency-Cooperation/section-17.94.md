##### § 17.94 Critical habitats. #####

(a) The areas listed in § 17.95 (fish and wildlife), § 17.96 (plants), and § 17.99 (plants on the Hawaiian Islands) and referred to in the lists at §§ 17.11 and 17.12 have been determined by the Director to be critical habitat. All Federal agencies must insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by them is not likely to result in the destruction or adverse modification of the constituent elements essential to the conservation of the listed species within these defined critical habitats. (See part 402 for rules concerning this prohibition; see also part 424 for rules concerning the determination of critical habitat).

|(1) A critical habitat designation in § 17.95(a), (b), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h), or (i), or in § 17.96(a), and the designation does not state that the map(s) is for informational purposes only, or  <br/>(2) A critical habitat designation in § 17.99, or  <br/>(3) A critical habitat designation published and effective after May 31, 2012,|The map provided by the Secretary of the Interior, as clarified or refined by any textual language within the rule, constitutes the definition of the boundaries of a critical habitat. Each critical habitat area will be shown on a map, with more-detailed information discussed in the preamble of the rulemaking documents published in the **Federal Register** and made available from the lead field office of the Service responsible for such designation. Each area will be referenced to the State(s), county(ies), or other local government units within which all or part of the critical habitat is located. General descriptions of the location and boundaries of each area may be provided to clarify or refine what is included within the boundaries depicted on the map, or to explain the exclusion of sites (e.g., paved roads, buildings) within the mapped area. Unless otherwise indicated within the critical habitat descriptions, the names of the State(s) and county(ies) are provided for informational purposes only and do not constitute the boundaries of the area.|
