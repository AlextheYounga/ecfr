##### ยง 10.14 Scope of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. #####

The prohibitions of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703) that make it unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner, to pursue, hunt, take, capture, or kill migratory birds, or attempt to engage in any of those actions, apply only to actions directed at migratory birds, their nests, or their eggs. Injury to or mortality of migratory birds that results from, but is not the purpose of, an action (*i.e.,* incidental taking or killing) is not prohibited by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
