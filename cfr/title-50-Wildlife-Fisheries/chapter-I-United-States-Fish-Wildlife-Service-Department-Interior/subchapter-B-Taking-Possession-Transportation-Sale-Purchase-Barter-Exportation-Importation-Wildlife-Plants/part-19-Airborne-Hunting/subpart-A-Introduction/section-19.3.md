The exemptions to general prohibitions of the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, that permit airborne hunting in certain circumstances (See subpart B of this part) do not supersede, or authorize the violation of, other laws designed for the conservation or protection of wildlife, including those laws prohibiting the shooting or harassing of bald and golden eagles, polar bears and other marine mammals, migratory birds, and other wildlife, *except* to the extent that airborne hunting is authorized by regulations or permits issued under authority of those laws.
