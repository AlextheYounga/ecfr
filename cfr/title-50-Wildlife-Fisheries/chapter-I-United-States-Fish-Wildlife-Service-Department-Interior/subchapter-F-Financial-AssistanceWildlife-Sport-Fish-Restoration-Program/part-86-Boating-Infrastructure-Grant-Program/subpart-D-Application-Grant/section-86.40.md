|(b) What is the amount of Federal funds I can receive in one BIG grant?|        Each year we make at least $200,000 available to each State. We may increase the award that States may request annually to an amount above $200,000 if enough funds are available and it is advantageous to the program mission. We announce each year in the annual NOFO posted at http://www.grants.gov the maximum Federal funds you may request         |We may limit funding to a maximum award of $1.5 million. We may increase the maximum funding you may request if enough funds are available and it is advantageous to the program mission. We announce each year in the annual NOFO posted at http://www.grants.gov the recommended maximum Federal funds you may request.|
|        (c) How many grant applications can I submit each year?        |Each State can only request up to the annual funding limit each year. You can do this by sending in one grant application with one project or multiple projects. The Regional WSFR Office may ask a State with multiple projects to prepare a separate grant request for each project, as long as the total of all projects does not exceed the annual funding limit|                                                                                                                                                        No limit.                                                                                                                                                        |

We recommend applications, based on scores and available funding, to the Director. The Director selects the applications for award.                                                      |
