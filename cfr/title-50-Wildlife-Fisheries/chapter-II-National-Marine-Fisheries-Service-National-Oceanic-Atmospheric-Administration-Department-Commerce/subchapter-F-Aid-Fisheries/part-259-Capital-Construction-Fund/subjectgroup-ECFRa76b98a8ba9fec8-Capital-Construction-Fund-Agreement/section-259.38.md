##### § 259.38 Miscellaneous. #####

(a) Wherever the Secretary prescribes time constraints herein for the submission of any CCF transactions, the postmark date shall control if mailed or, if personally delivered, the actual date of submission. All required materials may be submitted to any Financial Assistance Division office of the National Marine Fisheries Service.

(b) All CCF information received by the Secretary shall be held strictly confidential, except that it may be published or disclosed in statistical form provided such publication does not disclose, directly or indirectly, the identity of any fundholder.

(c) While recognizing that precise regulations are necessary in order to treat similarly situated parties similarly, the Secretary also realizes that precision in regulations can often cause inequitable effects to result from unavoidable, unintended, or minor discrepancies between the regulations and the circumstances they attempt to govern. The Secretary will, consequently, at his discretion, as a matter of privilege and not as a matter of right, attempt to afford relief to parties where literal application of the purely procedural, as opposed to substantive, aspects of these regulations would otherwise work an inequitable hardship. This privilege will be sparingly granted and no party should before the fact attempt to act in reliance on its being granted after the fact.

(d) These §§ 259.30 through 259.38 are applicable absolutely to all Interim CCF Agreements first entered into (or the amendment of all then existing Interim CCF Agreements, which amendment is first entered into) on or after the date these §§ 259.30 through 259.38 are adopted. These §§ 259.30 through 259.38 are applicable to all Interim CCF Agreements entered into before the date these §§ 259.30 through 259.38 are adopted, with the following exceptions only:

(1) The vessel age limitations imposed by § 259.31 shall not apply to already scheduled Schedule B objectives.

(2) The minimum deposits imposed by § 259.34 shall not apply to any party's tax year before that party's tax year next following the one in which these §§ 259.30 through 259.38 are adopted.

(e) These §§ 259.30 through 259.38 are specifically incorporated in all past, present, and future Interim CCF Agreements by reference thereto made in Whereas Clause number 2 of all such Interim CCF Agreements.
