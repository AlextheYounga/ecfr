##### § 259.30 Application for Interim Capital Construction Fund Agreement (“Interim CCF Agreement”). #####

(a) *General qualifications.* To be eligible to enter into an Interim CCF Agreement an applicant must:

(1) Be a citizen of the United States (citizenship requirements are those for documenting vessels in the coastwise trade within the meaning of section 2 of the Shipping Act, 1916, as amended);

(2) Own or lease one or more eligible vessels (as defined in section 607(k)(1) of the Act) operating in the foreign or domestic commerce of the United States.

(3) Have an acceptable program for the acquisition, construction, or reconstruction of one or more qualified vessels (as defined in section 607(k)(2) of the Act). Qualified vessels must be for commercial operation in the fisheries of the United States. If the qualified vessel is 5 net tons or over, it must be documented in the fisheries of the United States. Dual documentation in both the fisheries and the coastwise trade of the United States is permissible. Any vessel which will carry fishing parties for hire must be inspected and certified (under 46 CFR part 176) by the U.S. Coast Guard as qualified to carry more than six passengers or demonstrate to the Secretary's satisfaction that the carrying of fishing parties for hire will constitute its primary activity. The program must be a firm representation of the applicant's actual intentions. Vague or contingent objectives will not be acceptable.

(b) *Content of application.* Applicants seeking an Interim CCF Agreement may make application by letter providing the following information:

(1) Proof of U.S. citizenship;

(x) If a fishing vessel, the area of operation (which for fishing vessels means the general geographic areas in which each vessel will catch, process, or transport, or charter for each species or group of species of fish, shellfish, or other living marine resources).
