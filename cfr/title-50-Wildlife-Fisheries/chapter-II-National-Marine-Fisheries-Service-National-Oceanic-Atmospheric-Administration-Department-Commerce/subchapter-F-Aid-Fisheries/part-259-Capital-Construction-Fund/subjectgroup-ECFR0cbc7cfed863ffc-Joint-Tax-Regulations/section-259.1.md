##### § 259.1 Execution of agreements and deposits made in a Capital Construction Fund. #####

In the case of a taxable year of a taxpayer beginning after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1972, the rules governing the execution of agreements and deposits under such agreements shall be as follows:

(a) A capital construction fund agreement executed and entered into by the taxpayer on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years will be deemed to be effective on the date of the execution of such agreement or as of the close of business of the last regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such deposit relates, whichever day is earlier.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section, where:

(1) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1969, and prior to January 1, 1971, an application for a capital construction fund agreement is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1972, and a capital construction fund agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer prior to March 1, 1972, and

(2) For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and prior to January 1, 1972, an application for a capital construction fund agreement is filed by a taxpayer prior to January 1, 1973, and a capital construction fund agreement is executed and entered into by the taxpayer prior to March 1, 1973 (or, if earlier, 60 days after the publication of final joint regulations under section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended); then such a capital construction fund agreement will be deemed to be effective as of the close of business of the last regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such deposit related.

(c)(1) Deposits made in a capital construction fund pursuant to such an agreement within 60 days after the date of execution of the agreement, or on or prior to the due date, with extensions, for the filing of his Federal income tax return for such taxable year or years, whichever date shall be later, shall be deemed to have been made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the last regular business day of each such taxable year or years to which such deposit relates, whichever day is earlier.

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1970, and ending prior to January 1, 1972, deposits made later than the last date permitted under paragraph (c)(1) of this section but on or before January 9, 1973, in a capital construction fund pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary of Commerce, acting by and through the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, shall be deemed to have been made on the date of the actual deposit or as of the close of business of the last regular business day of such taxable year, whichever is earlier.

(d) Nothing in this section shall alter the rules and regulations governing the timing of deposits with respect to existing capital and special reserve funds or with respect to the treatment of deposits for any taxable year or years other than a taxable year or years beginning after December 31, 1969, and before January 1, 1972.1

1 The phrase “existing capital and special reserve funds” does not refer to the Capital Construction Fund program but rather to funds established with the Maritime Administration prior to the amendment of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, which authorized the Capital Construction Fund program.
