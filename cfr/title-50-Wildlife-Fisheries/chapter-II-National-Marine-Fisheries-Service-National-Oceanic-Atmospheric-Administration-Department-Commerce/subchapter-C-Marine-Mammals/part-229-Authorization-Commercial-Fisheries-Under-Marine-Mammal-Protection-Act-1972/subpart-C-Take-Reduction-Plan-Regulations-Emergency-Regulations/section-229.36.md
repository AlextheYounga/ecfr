(b) Definitions. In addition to the definitions contained in the MMPA and §§ 216.3 and 229.2 of this chapter, the following definitions apply.

(1) *Active gear* means mainline in the water with gangions (as defined in 50 CFR 635.2) or hooks attached.

(2) *Mid-Atlantic Bight* means the area bounded by rhumb lines connecting the following points: 43° N 77° W; 43° N 71° W; 35° N 71° W; 35° N 77° W; and 43° N 77° W.

(c) *Marine Mammal Handling and Release Placard.* The placard, “Marine Mammal Handling/Release Guidelines: A Quick Reference for Atlantic Pelagic Longline Gear,” must be kept posted inside the wheelhouse and on the working deck. You may contact the NMFS Southeast Regional Office at (727) 824-5312 to request additional copies of the placard.

(2) *Mainline length.* Mainline length cannot exceed 32 nmi.

(3) *Active gear.* There can be no more than 30 nmi of active gear.
