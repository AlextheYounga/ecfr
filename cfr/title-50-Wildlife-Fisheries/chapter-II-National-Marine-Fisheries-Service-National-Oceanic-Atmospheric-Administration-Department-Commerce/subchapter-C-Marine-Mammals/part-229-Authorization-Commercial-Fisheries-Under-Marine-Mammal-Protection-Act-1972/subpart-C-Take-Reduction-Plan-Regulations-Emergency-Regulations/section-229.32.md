##### § 229.32 Atlantic large whale take reduction plan regulations. #####

(a) *Purpose and scope* - (1) *Whales and fixed gear fisheries.* The purpose of this section is to implement the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan to reduce incidental mortality and serious injury of fin, humpback, and right whales in specific Category I and Category II commercial fisheries from Maine through Florida. Specific Category I and II commercial fisheries within the scope of the Plan are identified and updated in the annual List of Fisheries. The measures identified in the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan are also intended to benefit minke whales, which are not designated as a strategic stock, but are known to be taken incidentally in gillnet and trap/pot fisheries. The gear types affected by this plan include gillnets (*e.g.,* anchored, drift, and shark) and traps/pots. The Assistant Administrator may revise the requirements set forth in this section in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section;

(2) *Markings.* All specified gear in specified areas must be marked with the color code shown in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The color must be permanently marked on or along the rope or ropes specified under paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iv) of this section. Each colored mark must be clearly visible when the gear is hauled or removed from the water, including if the color of the rope is the same as or similar to the respective color code;

(i) *Northeast Region lobster and Jonah crab buoy line markings.* Beginning May 1, 2022, for all Federal and state Northeast Region lobster and Jonah crab trap/pot gear regulated under this section, the buoy lines must be marked with a solid mark at least 36 inches (91.4 cm) in length within 2 fathoms (3.7 m) of the surface buoy. When fishing in Federal waters, all Northeast Region lobster and Jonah crab trap/pot buoy lines must have an additional green mark of at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length no more than 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the 36-inch (91.4 cm) mark. These long marks within 2 fathoms (3.7 m) of the buoy must be solid marks that may be applied with dyed, painted, or heat-shrink tubing, insertion of a colored rope or braided sleeve, or the line may be marked as approved in writing by the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator. When fishing in state waters, the buoy line below the surface system must be marked by the principal port state color at least two additional times (top half, bottom half) and each mark must at least total 12 inches (30.5 cm) for a total of at least three marks in state waters. For dual permitted vessels, state regulations will determine whether green Federal markings in the surface system and buoy line below the surface system can remain on gear being fished in state waters. When in Federal waters, the buoy line below the surface system must be marked at least three additional times (top, middle, and bottom) with the state or LMA 3 specific color, and each mark must total at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length. An additional green mark of at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length denoting Northeast Region Federal waters must be placed within 6 inches (15.2 cm) of each area-specific colored mark for a total of at least eight marks in Federal waters. In marking or affixing the color code(s) for the 1-foot buoy line marks for gear regulated under this paragraph (b)(2)(i), the line may be: Dyed; painted, marked with thin colored whipping line, thin colored plastic, or heat-shrink tubing; spliced in insertion of a colored rope or braided sleeve or other material, or a thin line may be woven into or through the line; or the line may be marked as approved in writing by the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator. An outreach guide illustrating the techniques for marking gear is available from the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator upon request and posted on the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan website at *Fisheries.NOAA.gov/ALWTRP;*

(ii) *Other buoy line markings.* For all other trap/pot and gillnet gear regulated under this section, the buoy line must be marked at least three times (top, middle, bottom) and each mark must total at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) in length. If the mark consists of two colors, then each color mark may be at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) for a total mark of 12 inches (30.5 cm). In marking or affixing the color code for gear regulated under this paragraph (b)(2)(ii), the line may be: Dyed, painted, marked with thin colored whipping line, thin colored plastic, or heat-shrink tubing, spliced in insertion of a colored rope or braided sleeve or other material, or a thin line may be woven into or through the line, or the line may be marked as approved in writing by the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator. An outreach guide illustrating the techniques for marking gear is available from the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator upon request and posted on the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan website at *Fisheries.NOAA.gov/ALWTRP;*

(iii) *Net panel markings.* Shark gillnet gear net panels in the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area S, Southeast U.S. Monitoring Area and Other Southeast Gillnet Waters are required to be marked. The net panel must be marked along both the floatline and the leadline at least once every 100 yards (91.4 m);

(iv) *Surface buoy markings.* Trap/pot and gillnet gear regulated under this section must mark all surface buoys to identify the vessel or fishery with one of the following: The owner's motorboat registration number, the owner's U.S. vessel documentation number, the Federal commercial fishing permit number, or whatever positive identification marking is required by the vessel's home-port state. When marking of surface buoys is not already required by state or Federal regulations, the letters and numbers used to mark the gear to identify the vessel or fishery must be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in height in block letters or Arabic numbers in a color that contrasts with the background color of the buoy. An outreach guide illustrating the techniques for marking gear is available from the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator upon request and posted on the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan website *Fisheries.NOAA.gov/ALWTRP;*

(3) *Color code.* Gear must be marked with the appropriate colors to designate gear types and areas as follows:

\* For dual permitted vessels, state regulations will determine whether green marks can remain on gear being fished in state waters.

(c) *Restrictions applicable to trap/pot gear in regulated waters* - (1) *Universal trap/pot gear requirements.* In addition to the gear marking requirements listed in paragraph (b) of this section and the area-specific measures listed in paragraphs (c)(2) through (14) of this section, all trap/pot gear in regulated waters, including the Northern Inshore State Trap/Pot Waters Area, must comply with the universal gear requirements listed in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section;1

1 Fishermen are also encouraged to maintain their buoy lines to be as knot-free as possible. Splices are considered to be less of an entanglement threat and are thus preferable to knots.

(i) *No buoy line floating at the surface.* No person or vessel may fish with trap/pot gear that has any portion of the buoy line floating at the surface at any time when the buoy line is directly connected to the gear at the ocean bottom. If more than one buoy is attached to a single buoy line or if a high flyer and a buoy are used together on a single buoy line, floating line may be used between these objects;

(ii) *No wet storage of gear.* Trap/pot gear must be hauled out of the water at least once every 30 days; and

(iii) *Groundlines.* All groundlines must be composed entirely of sinking line. The attachment of buoys, toggles, or other floatation devices to groundlines is prohibited.

(2) *Area specific gear requirements.* Trap/pot gear must be set according to the requirements outlined in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section and in the table to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section;

(i) *Single traps and multiple-trap trawls.* All traps must be set according to the configuration outlined in the table to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section. Trawls up to and including five traps must only have one buoy line unless specified otherwise in the table to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section;

(ii) *Buoy line weak links.* With the exception of Northeast Region lobster and Jonah crab trap/pot trawls, all buoys, flotation devices and/or weights (except traps/pots, anchors, and leadline woven into the buoy line), such as surface buoys, high flyers, radar reflectors, subsurface buoys, toggles, window weights, etc., must be attached to the buoy line with a weak link placed either as close to each individual buoy, flotation device and/or weight as operationally feasible, or at the base of the surface system where the surface system attaches to the single buoy line, and that meets the following specifications;

(A) *Weak link breaking strengths.* The breaking strength of the weak links must not exceed the breaking strength listed in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section for a specified management area;

(B) *Approved weak links.* The weak link must be chosen from the following list approved by NMFS: Swivels, plastic weak links, rope of appropriate breaking strength, hog rings, rope stapled to a buoy stick, or other materials or devices approved in writing by the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator. An outreach guide illustrating the techniques for making weak links is available from the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator upon request and posted on the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan website *Fisheries.NOAA.gov/ALWTRP; and*

(C) *Clean breaks.* Weak links must break cleanly leaving behind the bitter end of the line. The bitter end of the line must be free of any knots when the weak link breaks. Splices are not considered to be knots for the purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C);

(iii) *Weak buoy lines and weak insertion devices.* Beginning May 1, 2022, all lobster and Jonah crab trap/pot buoy lines in the management areas and configurations outlined in the table to paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section must use weak line or must insert weak devices along the buoy line as described in the table to paragraph (c)(2)(iv). The weak line and weak insert devices must meet the following specifications;

(A) *Breaking strength.* The breaking strength of the weak buoy lines and weak insertion devices must not exceed 1,700 lb (771 kgs);

(B) *Approved devices and distance between weak insertions.* Weak insertion devices must be inserted in the specified intervals from the surface system and must be devices chosen from the following list approved by NMFS, including any rope no thinner than 5/16 inch (8 mm) diameter that is engineered to break at 1,700 lb (771 kg) or less in a color contrasting with the primary buoy line and 3 feet (91.4 cm) or longer spliced on either end into the primary buoy line. Splices that achieve nearly the manufactured breaking strength include but are not limited to: Three or more tuck splices, an eye to loop with 3 or more tuck splices, or a butt splice. A 3-foot long hollow braided sleeve such as those known as the South Shore Sleeve installed over a parted buoy line is approved. A plastic weak link engineered to break at 1700 lb (771 kg) or less in a color that contrasts with the buoy line and with the breaking strength imprinted on the weak link is approved. The Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator will approve other materials, devices, or configurations inserted according to specifications approved in writing by the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator. An outreach guide illustrating the techniques for making weak insert devices is available from the Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator upon request and posted on the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan website *Fisheries.NOAA.gov/ALWTRP; and*

(C) *Clean breaks.* Weak line and weak inserts must break cleanly leaving behind the bitter end of the line. The bitter end of the line must be free of any knots when the weak insert breaks. Splices are not considered to be knots for the purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(D).

(iv) *Table of area specific trap/pot gear requirements.*

(B) The gear is fished south of 27°51′ N.

(iii) *Exemption for vessels in transit with gillnet aboard.* Possession of gillnet gear aboard a vessel in transit is allowed if:

(A) All nets are covered with canvas other similar material and securely fastened to the deck, rail, or drum; and

(B) All buoys, high flyers, and anchors are disconnected from all gillnets.

(h) *Restrictions applicable to the Southeast U.S. Monitoring Area* - (1) *Area.* The Southeast U.S. Monitoring Area consists of the area from 27°51′ N lat. (near Sebastian Inlet, FL) south to 26°46.50′ N lat. (near West Palm Beach, FL), extending from the shoreline or exemption line out to 80°00′ W long.

(2) *Restrictions for Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery.* Fishing with or possessing gillnet gear with webbing of 5 inches (12.7 cm) or greater stretched mesh from December 1 through March 31 is allowed if:

(i) The gear complies with the gear marking requirements specified in paragraph (b) of this section;

(ii) The vessel owner/operator is in compliance with the vessel monitoring system (VMS) requirements found in 50 CFR 635.69; and

(iii) The vessel owner/operator and crew are in compliance with observer requirements found in § 229.7.

(3) *Restrictions for Southeastern U.S. Atlantic shark gillnet fishery vessels in transit.* Possession of gillnet gear with webbing of 5 inches (12.7 cm) or greater stretched mesh aboard a vessel in transit from December 1 through March 31 is allowed if:

(ii) The vessel owner/operator is in compliance with the vessel monitoring system (VMS) requirements found in 50 CFR 635.69.

(i) *Other provisions.* In addition to any other emergency authority under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered Species Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, or other appropriate authority, the Assistant Administrator may take action under this section in the following situations:

(1) *Entanglements in critical habitat or restricted areas.* If a serious injury or mortality of a right whale occurs in the Cape Cod Bay Restricted Area from January 1 through May 15, in the Great South Channel Restricted Area from April 1 through June 30, the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area N from November 15 to April 15, or the Southeast U.S. Restricted Area S from December 1 through March 31 as the result of an entanglement by trap/pot or gillnet gear allowed to be used in those areas and times, the Assistant Administrator shall close that area to that gear type (*i.e.,* trap/pot or gillnet) for the rest of that time period and for that same time period in each subsequent year, unless the Assistant Administrator revises the restricted period in accordance with paragraph (i)(2) of this section or unless other measures are implemented under paragraph (i)(2) of this section.

(2) *Other special measures.* The Assistant Administrator may, in consultation with the Take Reduction Team, revise the requirements of this section through a publication in the Federal Register if:

(i) NMFS verifies that certain gear characteristics are both operationally effective and reduce serious injuries and mortalities of endangered whales;

(ii) New gear technology is developed and determined to be appropriate;

(iii) Revised breaking strengths are determined to be appropriate;

(iv) New marking systems are developed and determined to be appropriate;

(v) NMFS determines that right whales are remaining longer than expected in a closed area or have left earlier than expected;

(vi) NMFS determines that the boundaries of a closed area are not appropriate;

(vii) Gear testing operations are considered appropriate; or

(viii) Similar situations occur.
