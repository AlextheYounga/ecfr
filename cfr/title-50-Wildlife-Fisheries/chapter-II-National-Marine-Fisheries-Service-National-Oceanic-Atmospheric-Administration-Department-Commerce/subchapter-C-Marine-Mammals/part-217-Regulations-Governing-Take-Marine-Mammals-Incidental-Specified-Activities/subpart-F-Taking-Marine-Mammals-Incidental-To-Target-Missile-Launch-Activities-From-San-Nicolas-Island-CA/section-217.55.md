##### § 217.55 Requirements for monitoring and reporting. #####

(a) Unless specified otherwise in the Letter of Authorization, the Holder of the Letter of Authorization must notify the Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS, by letter or telephone, at least 2 weeks prior to activities possibly involving the taking of marine mammals. If the authorized activity identified in § 217.50 is thought to have resulted in the mortality or injury of any marine mammals or in any take of marine mammals not identified in § 217.50(b), then the Holder of the Letter of Authorization must notify the Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, or designee, by telephone (301-427-8401), and the Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS, or designee, by telephone (562-980-3232), within 48 hours of the discovery of the injured or dead animal.

(b) The National Marine Fisheries Service must be informed immediately of any changes or deletions to any portions of the proposed monitoring plan submitted, in accordance with the Letter of Authorization.

(c) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must designate biologically trained, on-site individual(s), approved in advance by NMFS, to record the effects of the launch activities and the resulting noise on pinnipeds.

(d) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must implement the following monitoring measures:

(1) *Visual land-based monitoring.* (i) Prior to each missile launch, an observer(s) will place three autonomous digital video cameras overlooking chosen haul-out sites located varying distances from the missile launch site. Each video camera will be set to record a focal subgroup within the larger haul-out aggregation for a maximum of 4 hours or as permitted by the videotape capacity.

(ii) Systematic visual observations, by those individuals, described in paragraph (c) of this section, of pinniped presence and activity will be conducted and recorded in a field logbook a minimum of 2 hours prior to the estimated launch time and for no less than 1 hour immediately following the launch of target missiles.

(iii) Systematic visual observations, by those individuals, described in paragraph (c) of this section, of pinniped presence and activity will be conducted and recorded in a field logbook a minimum of 2 hours prior to launch, during launch, and for no less than 1 hour after the launch of the BQM-34, BQM-74, Tomahawk, RAM target and similar types of missiles.

(iv) Documentation, both via autonomous video camera and human observer, will consist of:

(A) Numbers and sexes of each age class in focal subgroups;

(B) Description and timing of launch activities or other disruptive event(s);

(C) Movements of pinnipeds, including number and proportion moving, direction and distance moved, and pace of movement;

(D) Description of reactions;

(E) Minimum distances between interacting and reacting pinnipeds;

(F) Study location;

(G) Local time;

(H) Substratum type;

(I) Substratum slope;

(J) Weather condition;

(K) Horizontal visibility; and

(L) Tide state.

(2) *Acoustic monitoring.* (i) During all target missile launches, calibrated recordings of the levels and characteristics of the received launch sounds will be obtained from three different locations of varying distances from the target missile's flight path. To the extent practicable, these acoustic recording locations will correspond with the haul-out sites where video and human observer monitoring is done.

(ii) Acoustic recordings will be supplemented by the use of radar and telemetry systems to obtain the trajectory of target missiles in three dimensions.

(iii) Acoustic equipment used to record launch sounds will be suitable for collecting a wide range of parameters, including the magnitude, characteristics, and duration of each target missile.

(e) The holder of the Letter of Authorization must implement the following reporting requirements:

(1) For each target missile launch, the lead contractor or lead observer for the holder of the Letter of Authorization must provide a status report to NMFS, West Coast Regional Office, providing reporting items found under the Letter of Authorization, unless other arrangements for monitoring are agreed upon in writing.

(2) The Navy shall submit an annual report describing their activities and including the following information:

(i) Timing, number, and nature of launch operations;

(ii) Summary of mitigation and monitoring implementation;

(iii) Summary of pinniped behavioral observations; and

(iv) Estimate of the amount and nature of all takes by harassment or by other means.

(3) The Navy shall submit a draft comprehensive technical report to the Office of Protected Resources and West Coast Regional Office, NMFS, 180 days prior to the expiration of the regulations in this subpart, providing full documentation of the methods, results, and interpretation of all monitoring tasks for launches to date plus preliminary information for missile launches during the first 6 months of the regulations.

(4) A revised final comprehensive technical report, including all monitoring results during the entire period of validity of the Letter of Authorization, will be due 90 days after the end of the period of effectiveness of the regulations in this subpart.

(5) The final report will be subject to review and comment by NMFS. Any recommendations made by NMFS must be addressed in the final comprehensive technical report prior to acceptance by NMFS.

(f) Activities related to the monitoring described in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, or in the Letter of Authorization issued under §§ 216.106 and 217.57 of this chapter, including the retention of marine mammals, may be conducted without the need for a separate scientific research permit.

(g) In coordination and compliance with appropriate Navy regulations, the NMFS may, at its discretion, place an observer on San Nicolas Island for any activity involved in marine mammal monitoring either prior to, during, or after a missile launch in order to monitor the impact on marine mammals.
