##### ยง 219.45 Mitigation requirements. #####

When conducting the activities identified in ยง 219.41(a), the mitigation measures contained in any LOA issued under ยง 216.106 of this chapter and ยง 219.47 must be implemented. These mitigation measures shall include but are not limited to:

(a) General conditions:

(1) NWFSC shall take all necessary measures to coordinate and communicate in advance of each specific survey with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) or other relevant parties on non-NOAA platforms to ensure that all mitigation measures and monitoring requirements described herein, as well as the specific manner of implementation and relevant event-contingent decision-making processes, are clearly understood and agreed upon;

(2) NWFSC shall coordinate and conduct briefings at the outset of each survey and as necessary between ship's crew (Commanding Officer/master or designee(s), as appropriate) and scientific party in order to explain responsibilities, communication procedures, marine mammal monitoring protocol, and operational procedures;

(3) NWFSC shall coordinate as necessary on a daily basis during survey cruises with OMAO personnel or other relevant personnel on non-NOAA platforms to ensure that requirements, procedures, and decision-making processes are understood and properly implemented;

(4) When deploying any type of sampling gear at sea, NWFSC shall at all times monitor for any unusual circumstances that may arise at a sampling site and use best professional judgment to avoid any potential risks to marine mammals during use of all research equipment; and

(5) NWFSC shall implement handling and/or disentanglement protocols as specified in the guidance that shall be provided to NWFSC survey personnel.

(b) For all research surveys using trawl, hook and line, or seine gear in Puget Sound, the move-on rule mitigation protocol described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section shall be implemented upon observation of killer whales at any distance.

(c) Trawl survey protocols:

(1) NWFSC shall conduct trawl operations as soon as is practicable upon arrival at the sampling station;

(2) NWFSC shall initiate marine mammal watches (visual observation) a minimum of ten minutes prior to beginning of net deployment but shall also conduct monitoring during pre-set activities including trackline reconnaissance, CTD casts, and plankton or bongo net hauls. Marine mammal watches shall be conducted by scanning the surrounding waters with the naked eye and rangefinding binoculars (or monocular). During nighttime operations, visual observation shall be conducted using the naked eye and available vessel lighting;

(3) NWFSC shall implement the move-on rule mitigation protocol, as described in this paragraph. If one or more marine mammals are observed within 500 meters (m) of the planned location in the 10 minutes before setting the trawl gear, and are considered at risk of interacting with the vessel or research gear, or appear to be approaching the vessel and are considered at risk of interaction, NWFSC shall either remain onsite or move on to another sampling location. If remaining onsite, the set shall be delayed. If the animals depart or appear to no longer be at risk of interacting with the vessel or gear, a further 10 minute observation period shall be conducted. If no further observations are made or the animals still do not appear to be at risk of interaction, then the set may be made. If the vessel is moved to a different section of the sampling area, the move-on rule mitigation protocol would begin anew. If, after moving on, marine mammals remain at risk of interaction, the NWFSC shall move again or skip the station. Marine mammals that are sighted further than 500 m from the vessel shall be monitored to determine their position and movement in relation to the vessel to determine whether the move-on rule mitigation protocol should be implemented. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making these decisions;

(4) NWFSC shall maintain visual monitoring effort during the entire period of time that trawl gear is in the water (*i.e.,* throughout gear deployment, fishing, and retrieval). If marine mammals are sighted before the gear is fully removed from the water, NWFSC shall take the most appropriate action to avoid marine mammal interaction. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision;

(5) If trawling operations have been suspended because of the presence of marine mammals, NWFSC may resume trawl operations when practicable only when the animals are believed to have departed the area. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this determination;

(6) When conducting surface trawls using the Nordic 264 net, dedicated crew with no other tasks shall conduct required marine mammal monitoring. Marine mammal monitoring shall be staffed in a stepwise process, with a minimum of two observers beginning pre-set monitoring and increasing to a minimum of four observers prior to and during gear deployment. During the tow, a minimum of three observers shall conduct required monitoring;

(7) NWFSC shall implement standard survey protocols to minimize potential for marine mammal interactions, including maximum tow durations at target depth and maximum tow distance, and shall carefully empty the trawl as quickly as possible upon retrieval. Trawl nets must be cleaned prior to deployment;

(8) NWFSC must install and use a marine mammal excluder device at all times when the Nordic 264 trawl net is used;

(9) NWFSC must install and use acoustic deterrent devices whenever the Nordic 264 trawl net is used, with two pairs of the devices installed near the net opening. NWFSC must ensure that the devices are operating properly before deploying the net;

(10) For use of the Kodiak surface trawl in Puget Sound, trawl survey protocols described in this section apply only to cetaceans; and

(11) Trawl survey protocols described in this section do not apply to use of pair trawl gear in the Columbia River.

(d) Hook and line (including longline) survey protocols:

(1) NWFSC shall deploy hook and line gear as soon as is practicable upon arrival at the sampling station;

(2) NWFSC shall initiate marine mammal watches (visual observation) no less than 30 minutes prior to both deployment and retrieval of longline gear. Marine mammal watches shall be conducted by scanning the surrounding waters with the naked eye and range-finding binoculars (or monocular). During nighttime operations, visual observation shall be conducted using the naked eye and available vessel lighting;

(3) NWFSC shall implement the move-on rule mitigation protocol, as described in this paragraph. If one or more marine mammals are observed within 500 m of the planned location in the ten minutes before gear deployment, and are considered at risk of interacting with the vessel or research gear, or appear to be approaching the vessel and are considered at risk of interaction, NWFSC shall either remain onsite or move on to another sampling location. If remaining onsite, the set shall be delayed. If the animals depart or appear to no longer be at risk of interacting with the vessel or gear, a further 10 minute observation period shall be conducted. If no further observations are made or the animals still do not appear to be at risk of interaction, then the set may be made. If the vessel is moved to a different section of the sampling area, the move-on rule mitigation protocol would begin anew. If, after moving on, marine mammals remain at risk of interaction, the NWFSC shall move again or skip the station. Marine mammals that are sighted further than 500 m from the vessel shall be monitored to determine their position and movement in relation to the vessel to determine whether the move-on rule mitigation protocol should be implemented. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making these decisions;

(4) NWFSC shall maintain visual monitoring effort during the entire period of gear deployment and retrieval. If marine mammals are sighted before the gear is fully deployed or retrieved, NWFSC shall take the most appropriate action to avoid marine mammal interaction. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision;

(5) If deployment or retrieval operations have been suspended because of the presence of marine mammals, NWFSC may resume such operations when practicable only when the animals are believed to have departed the area. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision;

(6) NWFSC shall implement standard survey protocols, including maximum soak durations and a prohibition on chumming; and

(7) For hook and line surveys in Puget Sound, but not including longline surveys, hook and line survey protocols described in this section apply only to cetaceans.

(e) Seine survey protocols:

(1) NWFSC shall conduct seine operations as soon as is practicable upon arrival at the sampling station;

(2) NWFSC shall conduct marine mammal watches (visual observation) prior to beginning of net deployment. Marine mammal watches shall be conducted by scanning the surrounding waters with the naked eye and rangefinding binoculars (or monocular);

(3) NWFSC shall implement the move-on rule mitigation protocol, as described in this paragraph for use of purse seine gear. If one or more small cetaceans (*i.e.,* dolphin or porpoise) or five or more pinnipeds are observed within 500 m of the planned location before setting the seine gear, and are considered at risk of interacting with the vessel or research gear, or appear to be approaching the vessel and are considered at risk of interaction, NWFSC shall either remain onsite or move on to another sampling location. If remaining onsite, the set shall be delayed. If the animals depart or appear to no longer be at risk of interacting with the vessel or gear, a further ten minute observation period shall be conducted. If no further observations are made or the animals still do not appear to be at risk of interaction, then the set may be made. If the vessel is moved to a different area, the move-on rule mitigation protocol would begin anew. If, after moving on, marine mammals remain at risk of interaction, the NWFSC shall move again or skip the station. Marine mammals that are sighted further than 500 m from the vessel shall be monitored to determine their position and movement in relation to the vessel to determine whether the move-on rule mitigation protocol should be implemented. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making these decisions;

(4) NWFSC shall maintain visual monitoring effort during the entire period of time that seine gear is in the water (*i.e.,* throughout gear deployment, fishing, and retrieval). If marine mammals are sighted before the gear is fully removed from the water, NWFSC shall take the most appropriate action to avoid marine mammal interaction. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this decision;

(5) If seine operations have been suspended because of the presence of marine mammals, NWFSC may resume seine operations when practicable only when the animals are believed to have departed the area. NWFSC may use best professional judgment in making this determination;

(6) If any cetaceans are observed in a purse seine net, NWFSC shall immediately open the net and free the animals; and

(7) NWFSC shall not make beach seine sets within 200 m of any hauled-out pinniped, and shall immediately remove the gear from the water upon observation of any marine mammal attempting to interact with the gear.
