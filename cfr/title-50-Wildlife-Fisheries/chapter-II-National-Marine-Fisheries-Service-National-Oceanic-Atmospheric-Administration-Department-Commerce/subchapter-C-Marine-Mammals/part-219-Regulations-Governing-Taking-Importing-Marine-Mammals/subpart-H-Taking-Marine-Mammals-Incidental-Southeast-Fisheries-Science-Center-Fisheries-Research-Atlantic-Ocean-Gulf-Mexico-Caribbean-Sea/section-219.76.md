##### § 219.76 Requirements for monitoring and reporting. #####

(a) *Compliance coordination.* SEFSC must designate a compliance coordinator who is responsible for ensuring and documenting compliance with all requirements of any LOA issued pursuant to §§ 216.106 of this chapter and 219.77 and for preparing for any subsequent request(s) for incidental take authorization. All partners must report to this SEFSC-based compliance coordinator.

(b) *Visual monitoring program.* (1) Marine mammal visual monitoring must occur prior to deployment of trawl, net, and hook and line gear, respectively; throughout deployment of gear and active fishing of research gears (not including longline soak time); prior to retrieval of longline gear; and throughout retrieval of all research gear.

(2) When vessels are transiting, the SEFSC must maintain marine mammal observations to avoid ship strike.

(c) *Training.* (1) SEFSC must conduct annual training for all SEFSC and affiliate chief scientists and other personnel who may be responsible for conducting dedicated marine mammal visual observations to explain mitigation measures, by gear and the purpose for each measure, and monitoring and reporting requirements in the LOA, mitigation and monitoring protocols, and marine mammal identification and species that the SEFSC is authorized to incidentally take. SEFSC may determine the agenda for these trainings.

(2) The training must provide detailed descriptions of reporting, data collection, and sampling protocols. This portion of the training will include instruction on how to complete new data collection forms such as the marine mammal watch log, the incidental take form (*e.g.,* specific gear configuration and details relevant to an interaction with protected species), and forms used for species identification and biological sampling. The biological data collection and sampling training module will include the same sampling and necropsy training that is used for the Southeast Regional Observer training.

(3) SEFSC must also dedicate a portion of training to discussion of best professional judgment, including use in any incidents of marine mammal interaction and instructive examples where use of best professional judgment was determined to be successful or unsuccessful.

(4) SEFSC must coordinate with NMFS' Office of Science and Technology to ensure training and guidance related to handling procedures and data collection is consistent with other fishery science centers.

(d) *Handling procedures and data collection.* (1) SEFSC must implement standardized marine mammal handling, disentanglement, and data collection procedures. These standard procedures will be subject to approval by NMFS' Office of Protected Resources (OPR).

(2) For any marine mammal interaction involving the release of a live animal, SEFSC must collect necessary data to facilitate a serious injury determination.

(3) SEFSC must provide its relevant personnel with standard guidance and training regarding handling of marine mammals, including how to identify different species, bring an individual aboard a vessel, assess the level of consciousness, remove fishing gear, return an individual to water, and log activities pertaining to the interaction.

(4) At least two persons aboard SEFSC ships and one person aboard smaller vessels, including vessels operated by partners where no SEFSC staff are present, must be trained in marine mammal handling, release, and disentanglement procedures.

(5) SEFSC must record such data on standardized forms, which will be subject to approval by OPR. SEFSC must also answer a standard series of supplemental questions regarding the details of any marine mammal interaction.

(6) For any marine mammals that are killed during fisheries research activities, when practicable, scientists will collect data and samples pursuant to Appendix D of the SEFSC DEA, “Protected Species Handling Procedures for SEFSC Fisheries Research Vessels.

(e) *Reporting.* (1) The SEFSC must follow protocol for reporting incidental takes:

(i) The SEFSC must notify the Southeast Marine Mammal Stranding Network (877-433-8299) immediately following the incidental take of a marine mammal. For injured/uninjured marine mammals, priority should be to release the animal before notifying the Stranding Network.

(ii) The SEFSC must report all marine mammal gear interaction to NMFS's Protected Species Incidental Take (PSIT) database within 48 hours of occurrence and must provide supplemental information to OPR and SERO upon request. Information related to marine mammal interaction (animal captured or entangled in research gear) must include details of research survey, monitoring conducted prior to interaction, full descriptions of any observations of the animals, the context (vessel and conditions), decisions made, and rationale for decisions made in vessel and gear handling.

(2) The SEFSC must submit a draft annual report to NMFS OPR. The period of reporting must be annual, beginning one year post-issuance of any LOA and the report must be submitted not less than ninety days following the end of a given year.

(i) SEFSC must provide a final report within thirty days following resolution of comments on the draft report.

(ii) These reports must contain, at minimum, the following:

(A) Annual line-kilometers and locations surveyed during which the EK60, ME70, and EQ50 (or equivalent sources) operating below 200 kHz were predominant and associated pro-rated estimates of actual take;

(B) Summary information regarding use of all trawl, gillnet, and hook and line gear, including location, number of sets, hook hours, tows, etc., specific to each gear;

(C) Accounts of surveys where marine mammals were observed during sampling but no interactions occurred;

(D) All incidents of marine mammal interactions, including circumstances of the event and descriptions of any mitigation procedures implemented or not implemented and why and, if released alive, serious injury determinations;

(E) Summary information related to any disturbance of marine mammals and distance of closest approach;

(F) A written evaluation of the effectiveness of SEFSC mitigation strategies in reducing the number of marine mammal interactions with survey gear, including gear modifications and best professional judgment and suggestions for changes to the mitigation strategies, if any;

(G) A summary of all relevant training provided by SEFSC and any coordination with NMFS Office of Science and Technology and the SERO;

(H) A summary of meeting(s) and workshop(s) outcomes with any partner working group, including, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, designed to reduce the number of marine mammal interactions; and

(I) A written description of any mitigation research investigation efforts and findings (*e.g.,* lazy line modifications).

(f) *Reporting of injured or dead marine mammals.* (1) In the unanticipated event that the activity defined in § 219.71(a) clearly causes the take of a marine mammal in a prohibited manner, SEFSC personnel engaged in the research activity must immediately cease such activity until such time as an appropriate decision regarding activity continuation can be made by the SEFSC Director (or designee). The incident must be reported immediately to OPR and SERO. OPR and SERO will review the circumstances of the prohibited take and work with SEFSC to determine what measures are necessary to minimize the likelihood of further prohibited take. The immediate decision made by SEFSC regarding continuation of the specified activity is subject to OPR concurrence. The report must include the information included in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

(2) SEFSC or partner must report all injured or dead marine mammals observed during fishery research surveys that are not attributed to the specified activity to the Southeast Regional Stranding Coordinator within 24 hours. If the discovery is made by a partner, the report must also be submitted to the SEFSC Environmental Compliance Coordinator. The following information must be provided:

(i) Time, date, and location (latitude/longitude) of the incident;

(ii) Description of the incident including, but not limited to, monitoring prior to and occurring at time of incident;

(iii) Environmental conditions (*e.g.,* wind speed and direction, Beaufort sea state, cloud cover, visibility);

(iv) Description of all marine mammal observations in the 24 hours preceding the incident;

(v) Species identification or description of the animal(s) involved;

(vi) Status of all sound source or gear used in the 24 hours preceding the incident;

(vii) Water depth;

(viii) Fate of the animal(s) (*e.g.* dead, injured but alive, injured and moving, blood or tissue observed in the water, status unknown, disappeared, etc.); and

(ix) Photographs or video footage of the animal(s).

(3) In the event of a ship strike of a marine mammal by any SEFSC or partner vessel involved in the activities covered by the authorization, SEFSC or partner must immediately report the information in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, as well as the following additional information:

(i) Vessel's speed during and leading up to the incident;

(ii) Vessel's course/heading and what operations were being conducted;

(iii) Status of all sound sources in use;

(iv) Description of avoidance measures/requirements that were in place at the time of the strike and what additional measures were taken, if any, to avoid strike;

(v) Estimated size and length of animal that was struck; and

(vi) Description of the behavior of the marine mammal immediately preceding and following the strike.
