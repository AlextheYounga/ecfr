NMFS may modify (including through addition or deletion) or augment the existing mitigation or monitoring measures (after consulting with the Navy regarding the practicability of the modifications) if doing so creates a reasonable likelihood of more effectively accomplishing the goals of mitigation and monitoring set forth in the preamble of these regulations. NMFS will provide a period of 30 days for public review and comment if such modifications are substantial. NMFS and the Navy will meet annually (if deemed necessary by either agency) to discuss the monitoring reports, Navy research and development outcomes, current science, and determine whether mitigation or monitoring modifications are appropriate. Below are some of the possible sources of new data that could contribute to the decision to modify the mitigation or monitoring measures:

(a) Results from the Navy's monitoring from the previous year's operation of SURTASS LFA sonar.

(b) Compiled results of Navy-funded research and development studies.

(c) Results from specific stranding investigations.

(d) Results from general marine mammal and sound research funded by the Navy or other sponsors.

(e) Any information that reveals marine mammals may have been taken in a manner, extent or number not anticipated by these regulations or subsequent Letters of Authorization.
