(a) When conducting training and testing activities, as identified in § 218.80, the mitigation measures contained in the LOA issued under §§ 216.106 and 218.87 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:

(1) *Lookouts.* The following are protective measures concerning the use of lookouts.

(i) Lookouts positioned on ships will be dedicated solely to diligent observation of the air and surface of the water. Their observation objectives will include, but are not limited to, detecting the presence of biological resources and recreational or fishing boats, observing mitigation zones, and monitoring for vessel and personnel safety concerns.

(ii) Lookouts positioned in aircraft or on small boats will, to the maximum extent practicable and consistent with aircraft and boat safety and training and testing requirements, comply with the observation objectives described in § 218.84 (a)(1)(i).

(iii) Lookout measures for non-impulsive sound:

(A) With the exception of ships less than 65 ft (20 m) in length and ships that are minimally manned, ships using low-frequency or hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar sources associated with anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare activities at sea will have two Lookouts at the forward position of the ship. For the purposes of this rule, low-frequency active sonar does not include surveillance towed array sensor system low-frequency active sonar.

(B) While using low-frequency or hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar sources associated with anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare activities at sea, vessels less than 65 ft (20 m) in length and ships that are minimally manned will have one Lookout at the forward position of the vessel due to space and manning restrictions.

(C) Ships conducting active sonar activities while moored or at anchor (including pierside testing or maintenance) will maintain one Lookout.

(D) Surface ships or aircraft conducting high-frequency or non-hull-mounted mid-frequency active sonar activities associated with anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare activities at sea will have one Lookout.

(E) Surface ships or aircraft conducting high-frequency active sonar activities associated with anti-submarine warfare and mine warfare activities at sea will have one Lookout.

One Lookout will be positioned in each of the two support vessels, or one in a support vessel and one in a helicopter. All divers placing the charges on mines will support the Lookouts while performing their regular duties. The divers placing the charges on mines will report all marine mammal sightings to their dive support vessel or Range Safety Officer.

(F) When mine neutralization activities using diver-placed charges with up to a 20-lb net explosive weight detonation (bin E6) are conducted with a time-delay firing device, four Lookouts will be used. Two Lookouts will be positioned in each of two small rigid hull inflatable boats. In addition, when aircraft are used, the pilot or member of the aircrew will serve as an additional Lookout. The divers placing the charges on mines will report all marine mammal sightings to their dive support vessel or Range Safety Officer.

(G) Surface vessels conducting line charge testing will have one Lookout.

(H) Surface vessels or aircraft conducting small- and medium-caliber gunnery exercises against a surface target will have one Lookout.

HBX charges, the Navy will have at least 10 Lookouts or trained marine species observers (or a combination thereof) positioned either in an aircraft or on multiple vessels (i.e., a Marine Animal Response Team boat and the test ship). If aircraft are used, there will be Lookouts or trained marine species observers positioned in an aircraft and positioned on multiple vessels. If vessels are the only platform, a sufficient number of additional Lookouts or trained marine species observers will be used to provide visual observation of the mitigation zone comparable to that achieved by aerial surveys.”

(O) Prior to commencing, during, and after completion of ship shock trials using up to 40,000 lb. HBX charges, the Navy will have at least 10 Lookouts or trained marine species observers (or a combination thereof) positioned in an aircraft and on multiple vessels (i.e., a Marine Animal Response Team boat and the test ship).

(A) The Navy shall avoid planning major training exercises involving the use of active sonar in the specified planning awareness areas (PAAs - see Figure 5.3-1 in the AFTT FEIS/OEIS) where feasible. Should national security require the conduct of more than four major exercises (C2X, JTFEX, or similar scale event) in these areas (meaning all or a portion of the exercise) per year, or more than one within the Gulf of Mexico areas per year, the Navy shall provide NMFS with prior notification and include the information in any associated after-action or monitoring reports.

(4) Stranding Response Plan:

(i) The Navy shall abide by the current Stranding Response Plan for Major Navy Training Exercises in the Study Area, to include the following measures:

(A) Shutdown Procedures - When an Uncommon Stranding Event (USE - defined in § 218.71 (b)(1)) occurs during a Major Training Exercise (MTE) in the AFTT Study Area, the Navy shall implement the procedures described. in paragraphs (a)(4)(i)(A)(*1*) through (*4*) of this section.

(*1*) The Navy shall implement a shutdown (as defined § 218.81(b)(2)) when advised by a NMFS Office of Protected Resources Headquarters Senior Official designated in the AFTT Study Area Stranding Communication Protocol that a USE involving live animals has been identified and that at least one live animal is located in the water. NMFS and the Navy will maintain a dialogue, as needed, regarding the identification of the USE and the potential need to implement shutdown procedures.

(*2*) Any shutdown in a given area shall remain in effect in that area until NMFS advises the Navy that the subject(s) of the USE at that area die or are euthanized, or that all live animals involved in the USE at that area have left the area (either of their own volition or herded).

(*3*) If the Navy finds an injured or dead animal floating at sea during an MTE, the Navy shall notify NMFS immediately or as soon as operational security considerations allow. The Navy shall provide NMFS with species or description of the animal(s), the condition of the animal(s), including carcass condition if the animal(s) is/are dead, location, time of first discovery, observed behavior (if alive), and photo or video (if available). Based on the information provided, NFMS will determine if, and advise the Navy whether a modified shutdown is appropriate on a case-by-case basis.

(*4*) In the event, following a USE, that qualified individuals are attempting to herd animals back out to the open ocean and animals are not willing to leave, or animals are seen repeatedly heading for the open ocean but turning back to shore, NMFS and the Navy shall coordinate (including an investigation of other potential anthropogenic stressors in the area) to determine if the proximity of mid-frequency active sonar training activities or explosive detonations, though farther than 14 nautical miles from the distressed animal(s), is likely contributing to the animals' refusal to return to the open water. If so, NMFS and the Navy will further coordinate to determine what measures are necessary to improve the probability that the animals will return to open water and implement those measures as appropriate.

(B) Within 72 hours of NMFS notifying the Navy of the presence of a USE, the Navy shall provide available information to NMFS (per the AFTT Study Area Communication Protocol) regarding the location, number and types of acoustic/explosive sources, direction and speed of units using mid-frequency active sonar, and marine mammal sightings information associated with training activities occurring within 80 nautical miles (148 km) and 72 hours prior to the USE event. Information not initially available regarding the 80-nautical miles (148-km), 72-hour period prior to the event will be provided as soon as it becomes available. The Navy will provide NMFS investigative teams with additional relevant unclassified information as requested, if available.
