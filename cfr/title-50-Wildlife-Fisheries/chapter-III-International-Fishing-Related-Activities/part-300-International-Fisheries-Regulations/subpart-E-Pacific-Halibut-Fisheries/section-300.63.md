##### § 300.63 Catch sharing plan and domestic management measures in Area 2A. #####

Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 21506, Apr. 11, 2023.

(a) A catch sharing plan (CSP) may be developed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council and approved by NMFS for portions of the fishery. Any approved CSP may be obtained from the Administrator, West Coast Region, NMFS.

(b)(1) Each year, before January 1, NMFS will publish a proposal to govern the recreational fishery under the CSP for the following year and will seek public comment. The comment period will extend until after the Commission's annual meeting, so the public will have the opportunity to consider the final area 2A total allowable catch (TAC) before submitting comments. After the Commission's annual meeting and review of public comments, NMFS will publish in the Federal Register the final rule governing sport fishing in area 2A. Annual management measures may be adjusted inseason by NMFS.

(2) A portion of the commercial TAC is allocated as incidental catch in the salmon troll fishery in Area 2A. Each year the landing restrictions necessary to keep the fishery within its allocation will be recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council at its spring meetings, and will be published in the Federal Register along with the annual salmon management measures.

(3) A portion of the Area 2A Washington recreational TAC is allocated as incidental catch in the sablefish primary fishery north of 46°53.30′ N lat. (Pt. Chehalis, Washington), which is regulated under 50 CFR 660.231. This fishing opportunity is only available in years in which the Washington recreational TAC is 214, 110 lb (97.1 mt) or greater, provided that a minimum of 10,000 lb (4.5 mt) is available to the sablefish fishery. Each year that this harvest is available, the landing restrictions necessary to keep this fishery within its allocation will be recommended by the Pacific Fishery Management Council at its spring meetings, and will be published in the Federal Register. These restrictions will be designed to ensure the halibut harvest is incidental to the sablefish harvest and will be based on the amounts of halibut and sablefish available to this fishery, and other pertinent factors. The restrictions may include catch or landing ratios, landing limits, or other means to control the rate of halibut landings.

(i) In years when this incidental harvest of halibut in the sablefish primary fishery north of 46°53.30′ N. lat. is allowed, it is allowed only for vessels using longline gear that are registered to groundfish limited entry permits with sablefish endorsements and that possess the appropriate incidental halibut harvest license issued by the Commission.

(ii) It is unlawful for any person to possess, land or purchase halibut south of 46°53.30′ N. lat. that were taken and retained as incidental catch authorized by this section in the sablefish primary fishery.

(4) The commercial longline fishery in area 2A is governed by the annual management measures published pursuant to §§ 300.62 and 300.63.

(5) The treaty Indian fishery is governed by § 300.64 and tribal regulations. The annual quota for the fishery will be announced with the Commission regulations under § 300.62

(c) *Flexible Inseason Management Provisions for Sport Halibut Fisheries in Area 2A.* (1) The Regional Administrator, NMFS West Coast Region, after consultation with the Chairman of the Pacific Fishery Management Council, the Commission Executive Director, and the Fisheries Director(s) of the affected state(s), or their designees, is authorized to modify regulations during the season after making the following determinations:

(i) The action is necessary to allow allocation objectives to be met.

(ii) The action will not result in exceeding the catch limit for the area.

(iii) If any of the recreational fishery subareas north of Cape Falcon, Oregon are not projected to utilize their respective quotas, NMFS may take inseason action to transfer any projected unused quota to another Washington recreational subarea.

(iv) If any of the sport fishery subareas south of Leadbetter Point, Washington, are not projected to utilize their respective quotas by their season ending dates, NMFS may take inseason action to transfer any projected unused quota to another Oregon sport subarea.

(v) Notwithstanding regulations at (c)(1)(i) of this section, if the total estimated yelloweye rockfish bycatch mortality from recreational halibut trips in all Oregon subareas is projected to exceed 22 percent of the annual Oregon recreational yelloweye rockfish harvest guideline, NMFS may take inseason action to reduce yelloweye rockfish bycatch mortality in the halibut fishery while allowing allocation objectives to be met to the extent possible.

(2) Flexible inseason management provisions include, but are not limited to, the following:

(i) Modification of sport fishing periods;

(ii) Modification of sport fishing bag limits;

(iii) Modification of sport fishing size limits;

(iv) Modification of sport fishing days per calendar week;

(v) Modification of subarea quotas; and

(vi) Modification of the Stonewall Bank Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area (YRCA) restrictions off Oregon using YRCA expansions as defined in groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 660.70(g) or (h).

(3) *Notice procedures.* (i) Actions taken under this section will be published in the Federal Register.

(ii) Actual notice of inseason management actions will be provided by a telephone hotline administered by the West Coast Region, NMFS, at 206-526-6667 or 800-662-9825. Since provisions of these regulations may be altered by inseason actions, sport fishers should monitor the telephone hotline for current information for the area in which they are fishing.

(4) *Effective dates.* (i) Any action issued under this section is effective on the date specified in the publication or at the time that the action is filed for public inspection with the Office of the Federal Register, whichever is later.

(ii) If time allows, NMFS will invite public comment prior to the effective date of any inseason action filed with the Federal Register. If the Regional Administrator determines, for good cause, that an inseason action must be filed without affording a prior opportunity for public comment, public comments will be received for a period of 15 days after publication of the action in the Federal Register.

(iii) Any inseason action issued under this section will remain in effect until the stated expiration date or until rescinded, modified, or superseded. However, no inseason action has any effect beyond the end of the calendar year in which it is issued.

(5) *Availability of data.* The Regional Administrator will compile, in aggregate form, all data and other information relevant to the action being taken and will make them available for public review during normal office hours at the West Coast Regional Office, NMFS, Sustainable Fisheries Division, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, Washington.

(d) *Fishery Election in Area 2A.* (1) A vessel that fishes in Area 2A may participate in only one of the following three fisheries in Area 2A:

(i) The sport fishery established in the annual domestic management measures and International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) regulations and defined at § 300.61;

(ii) The commercial directed fishery for halibut during the fishing period(s) established in the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations and/or the incidental retention of halibut during the sablefish primary fishery described at 50 CFR 660.231; or

(iii) The incidental catch fishery during the salmon troll fishery as authorized in the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations.

(2) No person shall fish for halibut in the sport fishery in Area 2A under the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations, from a vessel that has been used during the same calendar year for commercial halibut fishing in Area 2A, or that has been issued a permit for the same calendar year for the commercial halibut fishery in Area 2A.

(3) No person shall fish for halibut in the directed commercial halibut fishery during the fishing periods established in the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations, and/or retain halibut incidentally taken in the sablefish primary fishery in Area 2A from a vessel that has been used during the same calendar year for the incidental catch fishery during the salmon troll fishery, as authorized in the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations.

(4) No person shall fish for halibut in the directed commercial halibut fishery and/or retain halibut incidentally taken in the sablefish primary fishery in Area 2A from a vessel that, during the same calendar year, has been used in the sport halibut fishery in Area 2A or that is licensed for the sport charter halibut fishery in Area 2A.

(5) No person shall retain halibut in the salmon troll fishery in Area 2A as authorized under the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations, taken on a vessel that, during the same calendar year, has been used in the sport halibut fishery in Area 2A, or that is licensed for the sport charter halibut fishery in Area 2A.

(6) No person shall retain halibut in the salmon troll fishery in Area 2A as authorized under the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations, taken on a vessel that, during the same calendar year, has been used in the directed commercial halibut fishery during the fishing periods established in the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations, and/or retained halibut incidentally taken in the sablefish primary fishery for Area 2A or that is licensed to participate in these commercial fisheries during the fishing periods established in the annual domestic management measures and IPHC regulations in Area 2A.

(e) *Area 2A Non-Treaty Commercial Fishery Closed Areas.* (1) Non-treaty commercial vessels operating in the directed commercial fishery for halibut in Area 2A are required to fish outside of a closed area, known as the Rockfish Conservation Area (RCA), that extends along the coast from the U.S./Canada border south to 40°10′ N. lat. Between the U.S./Canada border and 46°16′ N. lat., the eastern boundary of the RCA, is the shoreline. Between 46°16′ N. lat. and 40°10′ N. lat., the RCA is defined along an eastern boundary by a line approximating the 30-fm (55-m) depth contour. Coordinates for the 30-fm (55-m) boundary are listed at 50 CFR 660.71(e). Between the U.S./Canada border and 40°10′ N. lat., the RCA is defined along a western boundary approximating the 100-fm (183-m) depth contour. Coordinates for the 100-fm (183-m) boundary are listed at 50 CFR 660.73(a).

(2) Non-treaty commercial vessels operating in the incidental catch fishery during the sablefish primary fishery north of Pt. Chehalis, Washington, in Area 2A are required to fish outside of a closed area. Under Pacific Coast groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 660.230, fishing with limited entry fixed gear is prohibited within the North Coast Commercial YRCA. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land halibut taken with limited entry fixed gear within the North Coast Commercial YRCA. The North Coast Commercial YRCA is an area off the northern Washington coast, overlapping the northern part of the North Coast Recreational YRCA, and is defined by straight lines connecting latitude and longitude coordinates. Coordinates for the North Coast Commercial YRCA are specified in groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 660.70(b).

(3) Non-treaty commercial vessels operating in the incidental catch fishery during the salmon troll fishery in Area 2A are required to fish outside of a closed area. Under the Pacific Coast groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 660.330(10), fishing with salmon troll gear is prohibited within the Salmon Troll YRCA. It is unlawful for commercial salmon troll vessels to take and retain, possess or land fish within the Salmon Troll YRCA. The Salmon Troll YRCA is an area off the northern Washington coast and is defined by straight lines connecting latitude and longitude coordinates. Coordinates for the Salmon Troll YRCA are specified in groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 660.70(c), and in salmon regulations at 50 CFR 660.405.

(f) *Pacific Halibut Permits for IPHC Regulatory Area 2A*—(1) *General.* (i) This section applies to persons and vessels that fish for Pacific halibut, or land and retain Pacific halibut, in IPHC regulatory area 2A. No person shall fish for Pacific halibut from a vessel, nor land or retain Pacific halibut on board a vessel, used either for commercial fishing or as a recreational charter vessel in IPHC regulatory area 2A, unless the NMFS West Coast Region has issued a permit valid for fishing in IPHC regulatory area 2A for that vessel.

(ii) A permit issued for a vessel operating in the Pacific halibut fishery in IPHC regulatory area 2A shall be valid for one of the following, per paragraph (d) of this section:

(A) The incidental catch of Pacific halibut during the salmon troll fishery specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section;

(B) The incidental catch of Pacific halibut during the sablefish fishery specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;

(C) The non-tribal directed commercial fishery during the fishing periods specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section;

(D) Both the incidental catch of Pacific halibut during the sablefish fishery specified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and the non-tribal directed commercial fishery during the fishing periods specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section; or

(E) The recreational charter fishery.

(iii) A permit issued under paragraph (f) of this section is valid only for the vessel for which it is registered. A change in ownership, documentation, or name of the registered vessel, or transfer of the ownership of the registered vessel will render the permit invalid.

(iv) A vessel owner must contact NMFS if the vessel for which the permit is issued is sold, ownership of the vessel is transferred, the vessel is renamed, or any other reason for which the documentation of the vessel is changed as the change would invalidate the current permit. A new permit application is required if there is a change in any documentation of the vessel. To submit a new permit application, follow the procedures outlined under paragraph (f)(2) of this section. If the documentation of the vessel is changed after the deadline to apply for a permit has passed as described at paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section, the vessel owner may contact NMFS and provide information on the reason for the documentation change and all permit application information described at paragraph (f)(2) of this section. NMFS may issue a permit, or decline to issue a permit and the applicant may appeal per paragraph (f)(3) of this section.

(v) A permit issued under paragraph (f) of this section must be carried on board that vessel at all times and the vessel operator shall allow its inspection by any authorized officer. The format of this permit may be electronic or paper.

(vi) No individual may alter, erase, mutilate, or forge any permit or document issued under this section. Any such permit or document that is intentionally altered, erased, mutilated, or forged is invalid.

(vii) Permits issued under paragraph (f) of this section are valid only during the calendar year (January 1-December 31) for which it was issued.

(viii) NMFS may suspend, revoke, or modify any permit issued under this section under policies and procedures in title 15 CFR part 904, or other applicable regulations in this chapter.

(2) *Applications*—(i) *Application form.* To obtain a permit, an individual must submit a complete permit application to the NMFS West Coast Region Sustainable Fisheries Division (NMFS) through the NOAA Fisheries Pacific halibut web page at *https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/west-coast/commercial-fishing/west-coast-fishing-permits.* A complete application consists of:

(A) An application form that contains valid responses for all data fields, including information and signatures.

(B) A current copy of the U.S. Coast Guard Documentation Form or state registration form or current marine survey.

(C) Payment of required fees as discussed in paragraph (f)(2)(iv) of this section.

(D) Additional documentation NMFS may require as it deems necessary to make a determination on the application.

(ii) *Deadlines.* (A) Applications for permits for the directed commercial fishery in regulatory area 2A must be received by NMFS no later than 2359 PST on February 15, or by 2359 PST the next business day in February if February 15 is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.

(B) Applications for permits, which allow for incidental catch of Pacific halibut during the salmon troll fishery and the sablefish primary fishery in Area 2A, must be received by NMFS no later than 2359 PST March 1, or by 2359 PST the next business day in March if March 1 is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday.

(C) Applications for permits for recreational charter vessels which allow for catch of Pacific halibut during the recreational fishery must be received a minimum of 15 days before intending to participate in the fishery, to allow for processing the permit application.

(iii) *Application review and approval.* NMFS shall issue a vessel permit upon receipt of a completed permit application submitted on the NOAA Fisheries website no later than the day before the start date of the fishery the applicant selected. If the application is not approved, NMFS will issue an initial administrative decision (IAD) that will explain the denial in writing. The applicant may appeal NMFS' determination following the process at paragraph (f)(3) of this section. NMFS will decline to act on a permit application that is incomplete or if the vessel or vessel owner is subject to sanction provisions of the Magnuson-Stevens Act at 16 U.S.C. 1858(a) and implementing regulations at 15 CFR part 904, subpart D.

(iv) *Permit fees.* The Regional Administrator may charge fees to cover administrative expenses related to processing and issuance of permits, processing change in ownership or change in vessel registration, divestiture, and appeals of permits. The amount of the fee is determined in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance Handbook for determining administrative costs. Full payment of the fee is required at the time a permit application is submitted.

(3) *Appeals.* In cases where the applicant disagrees with NMFS's decision on a permit application, the applicant may appeal that decision to the Regional Administrator. This paragraph (f)(3) describes the procedures for appealing the IAD on permit actions made in this title under this subpart.

(i) *Who may appeal?* Only an individual who received an IAD that disapproved any part of their application may file a written appeal. For purposes of this section, such individual will be referred to as the “permit applicant.”

(ii) *Appeal process.* (A) The appeal must be in writing, must allege credible facts or circumstances to show why the criteria in this subpart have been met, and must include any relevant information or documentation to support the appeal. The permit applicant may request an informal hearing on the appeal.

(B) Appeals must be mailed or faxed to: National Marine Fisheries Service, West Coast Region, Sustainable Fisheries Division, ATTN: Appeals, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA, 98115; Fax: 206-526-6426; or delivered to National Marine Fisheries Service at the same address.

(C) Upon receipt of an appeal authorized by this section, the Regional Administrator will notify the permit applicant, and may request additional information to allow action on the appeal.

(D) Upon receipt of sufficient information, the Regional Administrator will decide the appeal in accordance with the permit provisions set forth in this section at the time of the application, based upon information relative to the application on file at NMFS and any additional information submitted to or obtained by the Regional Administrator, the summary record kept of any hearing and the hearing officer's recommended decision, if any, and such other considerations as the Regional Administrator deems appropriate. The Regional Administrator will notify all interested persons of the decision, and the reasons for the decision, in writing, normally within 30 days of the receipt of sufficient information, unless additional time is needed for a hearing.

(E) If a hearing is requested, or if the Regional Administrator determines that one is appropriate, the Regional Administrator may grant an informal hearing before a hearing officer designated for that purpose after first giving notice of the time, place, and subject matter of the hearing to the applicant. The appellant, and, at the discretion of the hearing officer, other interested persons, may appear personally or be represented by counsel at the hearing and submit information and present arguments as determined appropriate by the hearing officer. Within 30 days of the last day of the hearing, the hearing officer shall recommend in writing a decision to the Regional Administrator.

(F) The Regional Administrator may adopt the hearing officer's recommended decision, in whole or in part, or may reject or modify it. In any event, the Regional Administrator will notify interested persons of the decision, and the reason(s) therefore, in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the hearing officer's recommended decision. The Regional Administrator's decision will constitute the final administrative action by NMFS on the matter.

(iii) *Timing of appeals.* (A) For permit issued under paragraph (f) of this section, if an applicant appeals an IAD, the appeal must be postmarked, faxed, or hand delivered to NMFS no later than 60 calendar days after the date on the IAD. If the applicant does not appeal the IAD within 60 calendar days, the IAD becomes the final decision of the Regional Administrator acting on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce.

(B) Any time limit prescribed in this section may be extended for a period not to exceed 30 days by the Regional Administrator for good cause, either upon his or her own motion or upon written request from the appellant stating the reason(s) therefore.

(iv) *Address of record.* For purposes of the appeals process, NMFS will establish as the address of record, the address used by the permit applicant in initial correspondence to NMFS. Notifications of all actions affecting the applicant after establishing an address of record will be mailed to that address, unless the applicant provides NMFS, in writing, with any changes to that address. NMFS bears no responsibility if a notification is sent to the address of record and is not received because the applicant's actual address has changed without notification to NMFS.

(v) *Status of permits pending appeal.* (A) For all permit actions, the permit registration remains as it was prior to the request until the final decision has been made.

(B) [Reserved]

(g) *Non-tribal directed commercial fishery management.* Each year a portion of regulatory area 2A's overall fishery limit is allocated consistent with the Pacific Fishery Management Council's Catch Sharing Plan to the non-tribal directed commercial fishery and published pursuant to § 300.62. The non-tribal directed commercial fishery takes place in the area south of Point Chehalis, WA (46°53.30′ N lat.).

(1) *Management measures.* Annually, NMFS will determine and publish in the Federal Register annual management measures for the upcoming fishing year for the non-tribal directed commercial fishery. This will include dates and lengths for the fishing periods for the Area 2A non-tribal directed commercial fishery, as well as the associated fishing period limits.

(i) *Fishing periods.* NMFS will determine the fishing periods, *e.g.,* dates and/or hours that permittees may legally harvest halibut in Area 2A, on an annual basis. This determination will take into account any recommendations provided by the Pacific Fishery Management Council and comments received by the public during the public comment period on the proposed annual management measures rule. The intent of these fishing periods is to ensure the Area 2A Pacific halibut directed commercial allocation is achieved but not exceeded.

(ii) *Fishing period limits.* NMFS will establish fishing period limits, *e.g.,* the maximum amount of Pacific halibut that a vessel may retain and land during a specific fishing period, and assign those limits according to vessel class for each fishing period. Fishing period limits may be different across vessel classes (except as described in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section). NMFS will determine fishing period limits following the considerations listed in paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(A) of this section. The intent of these fishing period limits is to ensure that the Area 2A commercial directed fishery does not exceed the directed commercial allocation, while attempting to provide fair and equitable access across fishery participants to an attainable amount of harvest. The limits will be published in annual management measures rules in the Federal Register along with a description of the considerations used to determine them.

(A) *Considerations.* When determining fishing period(s) and associated fishing period limits for the directed commercial fishery, NMFS will consider the following factors:

(*1*) The directed commercial fishery allocation;

(*2*) Vessel class;

(*3*) Number of fishery permit applicants and projected number of participants per vessel class;

(*4*) The average catch of vessels compared to past fishing period limits;

(*5*) Other relevant factors.

(B) *Vessel classes.* Vessel classes are based on overall length (defined at 46 CFR 69.9) shown in the following table:

Table 1 to Paragraph (g)(1)(ii)(B)

|Overall length  <br/>(in feet)|Vessel class|
|------------------------------|------------|
|             1-25             |     A      |
|            26-30             |     B      |
|            31-35             |     C      |
|            36-40             |     D      |
|            41-45             |     E      |
|            46-50             |     F      |
|            51-55             |     G      |
|             56+              |     H      |

(iii) *Inseason action to add fishing periods and associated fishing period limits.* Fishing periods in addition to those originally implemented at the start of the fishing year may be warranted in order to provide the fishery with opportunity to achieve the Area 2A directed commercial fishery allocation, if performance of the fishery during the initial fishing period(s) is different than expected and the directed commercial allocation is not attained through the initial period(s). If NMFS makes the determination that sufficient allocation remains to warrant additional fishing period(s) without exceeding the allocation for the Area 2A directed commercial fishery, the additional fishing period(s) and fishing period limits may be added during the fishing year. If NMFS determines fishing period(s) in addition to those included in an annual management measures rule is warranted, NMFS will set the fishing period limits equal across all vessel classes. The fishing period(s) and associated fishing period limit(s) will be announced in the Federal Register and concurrent publication on the hotline. If the amount of directed commercial allocation remaining is determined to be insufficient for an additional fishing period, the allocation is considered to be taken and the fishery will be closed, as described at paragraph (g)(2) of this section.

(2) *Automatic closure of the non-tribal directed commercial fishery.* The NMFS Regional Administrator or designee will initiate automatic management actions without prior public notice or opportunity to comment. These actions are nondiscretionary and the impacts must have been previously been taken into account.

(i) If NMFS determines that the non-tribal directed commercial fishery has attained its annual allocation or is projected to attain its allocation if additional fishing was to be allowed, the Regional Administrator will take automatic action to close the fishery, via announcement in the Federal Register and concurrent notification on the telephone hotline at 206-526-6667 or 800-662-9825.

(ii) [Reserved]
