##### § 300.114 Dealer permits and preapproval. #####

(a) *General.* (1) A dealer importing, or re-exporting AMLR, or a person exporting AMLR, must possess a valid IFTP issued under § 300.322 and file, as specified under § 300.323, the required data sets electronically with CBP at the time of, or in advance of importation or exportation. Required data set has the same meaning as § 300.321 (*see* definition of “Documentation and data sets required.”) See § 300.322 for IFTP application procedures and permit regulations. The IFTP holder may only conduct those specific activities stipulated by the IFTP. Preapproval from NMFS is required for each shipment of frozen *Dissostichus* species.

(2) An AMLR may be imported into the United States if its harvest has been authorized by a U.S.-issued individual permit or its importation has been authorized by an IFTP and, in the case of frozen *Dissostichus* species, preapproval issued under § 300.114(a)(1). AMLRs may not be released for entry into the United States unless accompanied by the harvesting permit, the individual permit, or IFTP and, in the case of frozen *Dissostichus* species, the preapproval certification granted by NMFS to allow import. NMFS will only accept electronic catch documents for toothfish imports.

(3) In no event may a marine mammal be imported into the United States unless authorized and accompanied by an import permit issued under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species Act.

(4) An IFTP or preapproval issued under this section does not authorize the harvest or transshipment of any AMLR by or to a vessel of the United States.

(b) *Application.* Application forms for preapproval are available from NMFS.

(c) *Fees.* A fee to recover the administrative expenses associated with processing preapproval applications will be charged. The amount of the fee will be determined in accordance with procedures specified in the NOAA Finance Handbook for calculating administrative costs of special products and services. The fee is specified with the preapproval application form. The appropriate fee must accompany each application and be paid by check, draft, or money order.

(d) *Issuance.* NMFS may issue a preapproval if it determines that the activity proposed by the dealer meets the requirements of the Act and that the resources were not or will not be harvested in violation of any CCAMLR conservation measure in force with respect to the United States or in violation of any regulation in this subpart.

(e) *Duration.* A preapproval is valid until the product is imported. Each export or re-export document created by NMFS in the CDS is valid only for that particular shipment.

(f) *Transfer.* A preapproval issued under this section is not transferable or assignable.

(g) *Changes in information* - (1) *Pending applications.* Applicants for preapproval under this section must report in writing to NMFS any change in the information submitted in preapproval applications.

(2) *Issued preapprovals.* Any entity issued a preapproval under this section must report in writing to NMFS any changes in previously submitted information.

(h) *Revision, suspension, or revocation.* A preapproval issued under this section may be revised, suspended, or revoked, based upon a violation of the IFTP, the Act, or this subpart. Failure to report a change in the information contained in a preapproval application voids the application or preapproval. Title 15 CFR part 904 governs sanctions under this subpart.

(i) *Exception.* Preapproval is not required for shipments of fresh *Dissostichus* species. A report of a shipment of fresh *Dissostichus* species must be completed and submitted to NMFS within 24 hours following import.

(j) *SVDCD.* Preapprovals will not be issued for *Dissostichus* spp. offered for sale or other disposition under a Specially Validated DCD.
