##### ยง 300.112 Harvesting permits. #####

(a) *General.* (1) Every vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States that attempts to reduce or reduces any AMLR to possession must have a harvesting permit authorizing the attempt or reduction, unless the attempt or reduction occurs during recreational fishing or is covered by an individual permit. Boats launched from a vessel issued a harvesting permit do not require a separate permit, but are covered by the permit issued the launching vessel. Any enforcement action that results from the activities of a launched boat will be taken against the launching vessel.

(2) Permits issued under this section do not authorize vessels or persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to harass, capture, harm, kill, harvest, or import marine mammals. No marine mammals may be taken in the course of commercial fishing operations unless the taking is allowed under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and/or the Endangered Species Act pursuant to an exemption or permit granted by the appropriate agency.

(b) *Responsibility of owners and operators.* (1) The owners and operators of each harvesting vessel are jointly and severally responsible for compliance with the Act, this subpart, and any permit issued under the Act and this subpart.

(2) The owners and operators of each such vessel are responsible for the acts of their employees and agents constituting violations, regardless of whether the specific acts were authorized or forbidden by the owners or operators, and regardless of knowledge concerning their occurrence.

(3) The owner of such vessel must report any sale, change in ownership, or other disposition of the vessel to the Assistant Administrator within 15 days of the occurrence.

(4) The owners and operators of each krill harvesting vessel using trawl gear in Convention Area fisheries must install a seal excluder device.

(c) *Application.* Application forms for harvesting permits are available at *www.nmfs.noaa.gov.gpea\_forms.htm.*

(1) A separate fully completed and accurate application must be completed and received by NMFS for each vessel for which a harvesting permit is requested.

(2) Applications for permits to harvest species other than krill must be received by NMFS at least 90 days before the date anticipated for the beginning of harvesting.

(3) Applications for a permit to harvest krill must be received by NMFS no later than June 1 immediately prior to the season in which the harvesting would occur. The applications must, to the extent possible, identify the products to be derived from the anticipated krill catch.

(d) *Issuance.* The Assistant Administrator may issue a harvesting permit to a vessel if the Assistant Administrator determines that the harvesting described in the application will meet the requirements of the Act and will not:

(1) Decrease the size of any harvested population to levels below those that ensure its stable recruitment. For this purpose, the Convention recommends that its size not be allowed to fall below a level close to that which ensures the greatest net annual increment.

(2) Upset the ecological relationships between harvested, dependent, and related populations of AMLRs and the restoration of depleted populations to levels that will ensure stable recruitment.

(3) Cause changes or increase the risk of changes in the marine ecosystem that are not potentially reversible over 2 or 3 decades, taking into account the state of available knowledge of the direct and indirect impact of harvesting, the effect of the introduction of alien species, the effects of associated activities on the marine ecosystem and of the effects of environmental changes, with the aim of making possible the sustained conservation of AMLRs.

(4) Violate the management measures issued pursuant to ยง 300.111 of this subpart.

(5) Violate any other conservation measures in force with respect to the United States under the Convention or the Act.

(e) *Duration.* A harvesting permit is valid from its date of issuance to its date of expiration unless it is revoked or suspended.

(f) *Transfer.* Permits are not transferable or assignable. A permit is valid only for the vessel to which it is issued.

(g) *Display.* Each harvesting vessel when engaged in harvesting must either have on board an up-to-date copy of its harvesting permit or a fully completed and up-to-date harvesting vessel certificate and the vessel operator must produce it for inspection upon the request of an authorized officer or CCAMLR inspector. In order for the certificate to be considered complete, the vessel owner or operator must enter on it the name and IRCS of the vessel issued the harvesting permit, the number of the harvesting permit and its date of issuance and expiration, the harvesting authorized by the permit, and all conditions and restrictions contained in the permit. Blank certificates are available from the Assistant Administrator.

(h) *Changes in information submitted by permit applicants or holders* - (1) *Changes in pending applications.* Applicants for a harvesting permit must report to the Assistant Administrator in writing any change in the information contained in the application. The processing period for the application will be extended as necessary to review the change.

(2) *Changes occurring after permit issuance* - (i) *Changes other than in the manner and amount of harvesting.* The owner or operator of a vessel that has been issued a harvesting permit must report to the Assistant Administrator in writing any change in previously submitted information other than a proposed change in the location, manner, or amount of harvesting within 15 days of the change. Based on such reported information, the Assistant Administrator may revise the permit effective upon notification to the permit holder. As soon as possible, the vessel owner or operator must revise any harvesting vessel certificate evidencing the permit, accordingly.

(ii) *Requested changes in the location, manner, or amount of harvesting.* Any changes in the manner or amount of harvesting must be proposed in writing to the Assistant Administrator and may not be undertaken unless authorized by the Assistant Administrator through a permit revision or issuance of a new permit. If a requested change in the location, manner, or amount of harvesting could significantly affect the status of any Antarctic marine living resource, the Assistant Administrator will treat the requested change as an application for a new permit and so notify the holder.

(i) *Additional conditions and restrictions.* The Assistant Administrator may revise the harvesting permit, effective upon notification to the permit holder, to impose additional conditions and restrictions on the harvesting vessel as necessary to achieve the purposes of the Convention or the Act. The permit holder must, as soon as possible, direct the vessel operator to revise the harvesting vessel certificate, if any, accordingly.

(j) *Revision, suspension, or revocation for violations.* A harvesting permit may be revised, suspended, or revoked if the harvesting vessel is involved in the commission of any violation of its permit, the Act, or this subpart. Failure to report a change in the information contained in an application within 15 days of the change is a violation of this subpart and voids the application or permit, as applicable. If a change in vessel ownership is not reported, the violation is chargeable to the previous owner. Title 15 CFR part 904 governs permit sanctions under this subpart.

(k) *Transshipment vessels.* Any U.S. flagged vessel that receives or attempts to receive *Dissostichus* species from a harvesting vessel at sea, regardless of whether such transshipment occurs in waters under the jurisdiction of CCAMLR, must obtain from NMFS a harvesting permit authorizing transshipment. Transshipment vessels must comply with the permitting provisions of this section with respect to harvesting vessels.
