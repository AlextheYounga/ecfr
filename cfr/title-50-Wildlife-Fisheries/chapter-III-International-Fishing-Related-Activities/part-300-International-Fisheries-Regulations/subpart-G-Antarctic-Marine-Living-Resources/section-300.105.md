(2) Catch and effort data have never been submitted to CCAMLR; or

(3) Catch and effort data from the two most recent seasons in which fishing occurred have not been submitted to CCAMLR.

(b) An individual subject to these regulations intending to develop a new fishery shall notify the Assistant Administrator no later than July 1 of the year in which he or she intends to initiate the fishery and shall not initiate the fishery pending CCAMLR review.

(c) The notification shall be accompanied by information on:

(1) The nature of the proposed fishery, including target species, methods of fishing, proposed region and any minimum level of catches that would be required to develop a viable fishery.

(2) Biological information from comprehensive research/survey cruises, such as distribution, abundance, demographic data and information on stock identity.

(3) Details of dependent and associated species and the likelihood of them being affected by the proposed fishery.
