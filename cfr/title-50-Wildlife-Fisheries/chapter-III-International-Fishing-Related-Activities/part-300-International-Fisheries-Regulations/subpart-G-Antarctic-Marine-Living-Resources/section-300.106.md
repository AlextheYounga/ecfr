##### ยง 300.106 Exploratory fisheries. #####

(a) An exploratory fishery, for purposes of this section, is a fishery that was previously defined as a new fishery under ยง 300.105.

(b) A fishery will continue to be classified as an exploratory fishery until sufficient information is available to:

(1) Evaluate the distribution, abundance, and demography of the target species, leading to an estimate of the fishery's potential yield.

(2) Review the fishery's potential impacts on dependent and related species.

(3) Allow the CCAMLR Scientific Committee to formulate and provide advice to the Commission on appropriate harvest catch levels and fishing gear.

(c) The operator of any vessel engaging in an exploratory fishery must submit, by the date specified in the operator's harvesting permit, catch, effort, and related biological, ecological, and environmental data as required by a data collection plan for the fishery formulated by the CCAMLR Scientific Committee.

(d) In addition to the requirements in ยง 300.112, any individual planning to enter an exploratory fishery must notify the Assistant Administrator no later than 4 months in advance of the annual meeting of CCAMLR. The Assistant Administrator will not issue a permit to enter an exploratory fishery until after the requirements of ยง 300.112 have been met and the meeting of CCAMLR, which receives and considers the notice made to the Assistant Administrator, has been concluded.
