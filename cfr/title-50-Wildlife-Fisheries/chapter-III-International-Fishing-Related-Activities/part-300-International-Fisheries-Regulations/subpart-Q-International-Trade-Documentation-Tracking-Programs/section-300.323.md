Any person, including a resident agent for a nonresident entity (see 19 CFR 141.18), who imports as defined in ยง 300.321, exports, or re-exports fish or fish products regulated under this sub-part from any ocean area, must file all reports and documentation required under the AMLR trade program, HMS ITP, and TTVP as specified under this title and under other regulations that incorporate by reference the requirements of this subpart. For imports, specific instructions for electronic filing are found in Customs and Trade Automated Interface Requirements (CATAIR) Appendix PGA (*https://www.cbp.gov/document/guidance/appendix-pga*). For exports, specific instructions for electronic filing are found in Automated Export System Trade Interface Requirements (AESTIR) Appendix Q (*https://www.cbp.gov/document/guidance/aestir-draft-appendix-q-pga-record-formats*). For fish and fish products regulated under this subpart, an ACE entry filing or AES export filing, as applicable, is required regardless of value, except in cases where CBP provides alternate means of collecting NMFS-required data and/or document images.
