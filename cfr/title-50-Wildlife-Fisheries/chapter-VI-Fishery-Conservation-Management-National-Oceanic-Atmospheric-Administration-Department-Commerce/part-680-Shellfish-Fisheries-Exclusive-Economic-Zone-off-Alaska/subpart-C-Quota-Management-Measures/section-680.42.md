(2) A person may not use more than 60 percent of the IPQ issued in the BSS crab QS fishery with a North region designation during a crab fishing year except that a person who:

(i) Holds IPQ; and

(ii) Has a 10 percent or greater direct or indirect ownership interest in the shoreside crab processor or stationary floating crab processor where that IPQ crab is processed will not be considered to use any IPQ in the BSS crab QS fishery with a North region designation if that IPQ meets the requirements described in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.

(3) Non-individual persons holding PQS will be required to provide, on an annual basis, a list of persons with an ownership interest in the non-individual PQS holder. This list of owners shall be provided to the individual level and will include the percentage of ownership held by each individual. This annual submission of information must be submitted as part of the complete annual application for crab IFQ/IPQ permit. A person will be considered to be a holder of PQS for purposes of applying the PQS use caps in this paragraph if that person:

(i) Is the sole proprietor of an entity that holds PQS; or

(ii) Directly or indirectly owns a 10 percent or greater interest in an entity that holds PQS.

(4) Before July 1, 2007, IPQ for the BSS, BBR, PIK, SMB, and EAG crab QS fisheries may not be used to process crab derived from PQS based on activities in an ECC, except in the geographic boundaries established in paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, except that, before July 1, 2007:

(i) Ten percent of the IPQs that are issued for a crab QS fishery or an amount of IPQ that yields up to 500,000 raw crab pounds (226.7 mt) on an annual basis, whichever is less, may be leased for use in processing crab outside that ECC. The amount of IPQ that is issued on an annual basis for use in that ECC and the amount that may be leased outside that ECC will be established annually and will be divided on a pro rata basis among all PQS permit holders issued IPQ for use in that ECC for that year.

(ii) IPQ in excess of the amounts specified in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section may be used outside the ECC for which that IPQ is designated if an unavoidable circumstance prevents crab processing within that ECC. For purposes of this section, an unavoidable circumstance exists if the specific intent to conduct processing for a crab QS species in that ECC was thwarted by a circumstance that was:

(A) Unavoidable;

(B) Unique to the IPQ permit holder, or to the processing facility used by the IPQ permit holder in that ECC;

(C) Unforeseen and reasonably unforeseeable to the IPQ permit holder;

(D) The circumstance that prevented the IPQ permit holder from processing crab in that ECC actually occurred; and

(E) The IPQ permit holder took all reasonable steps to overcome the circumstance that prevented the IPQ permit holder from conducting processing for that crab QS fishery in that ECC.

(iii) This provision does not exempt any IPQ permit holder from any regional designation that may apply to that IPQ.

(iv) Geographic boundaries for use of IPQ outside ECCs for purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section:

(C) Adak: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the City of Adak as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska;

(D) Unalaska/Dutch Harbor: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the City of Unalaska as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska.

(E) St. George: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the City of St. George as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska.

(F) St. Paul: IPQ may not be used outside of the boundaries of the City of St. Paul as those boundaries are established by the State of Alaska.

(5) Any person harvesting crab under a Class A CVO or Class A CVC IFQ Permit, except as provided under paragraph (b)(4) of this section, must deliver that crab:

(i) Only to RCRs with unused IPQ for the same crab QS fishery; and

(ii) Only to an RCR in the region for which the QS and IFQ is designated.

(6) Any person harvesting crab under a Class B IFQ, CPO IFQ, CVC IFQ, or CPC IFQ permit may deliver that crab to any RCR.

(7) Any IPQ crab that is received by an RCR will not be considered use of IPQ by an IPQ holder who has a 10 percent or greater direct or indirect ownership interest in the shoreside crab processor or stationary floating crab processor where that IPQ crab is processed under ยง 680.7(a)(7) or paragraph (a)(8) of this section if:

(i) That RCR is not affiliated with an IPQ holder who has a 10 percent or greater direct or indirect ownership interest in the shoreside crab processor or stationary floating crab processor where that IPQ crab is processed; and

(ii) The IPQ crab meets the conditions in paragraphs (b)(7)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section or the IPQ crab meets the conditions in paragraph (b)(7)(ii)(C) of this section:

(A) The IPQ crab is:

(*1*) BSS IPQ crab with a North region designation;

(*2*) EAG IPQ crab;

(*3*) EBT IPQ crab;

(*4*) PIK IPQ crab;

(*5*) SMB IPQ crab;

(*6*) WAG IPQ crab provided that IPQ crab is processed west of 174 degrees west longitude;

(*7*) WAI IPQ crab; or

(*8*) WBT IPQ crab.

(B) That IPQ crab is processed at:

(*1*) Any shoreside crab processor located within the boundaries of a home rule, first class, or second class city in the State of Alaska in existence on June 29, 2009; or

(*2*) Any stationary floating crab processor that is:

(*i*) Located within the boundaries of a home rule, first class, or second class city in the State of Alaska in existence on June 29, 2009;

(*ii*) Moored at a dock, docking facility, or at a permanent mooring buoy, unless that stationary floating crab processor is located within the boundaries of the city of Atka in which case that stationary floating crab processor is not required to be moored at a dock, docking facility, or at a permanent mooring buoy; and

(*iii*) Located within a harbor, unless that stationary floating crab processor is located within the boundaries of the city of Atka on June 29, 2009, in which case that stationary floating crab processor is not required to be located within a harbor.

(C) The IPQ crab is:

(*1*) Derived from PQS that is, or was, subject to a ROFR as that term is defined at ยง 680.2;

(*2*) Derived from PQS that has been transferred from the initial recipient of those PQS to another person under the requirements described at ยง 680.41;

(*3*) Received by an RCR who is not the initial recipient of those PQS; and

(*4*) Received by an RCR within the boundaries of the ECC for which that PQS and IPQ derived from that PQS is, or was, designated in the ROFR.

(8) Any IPQ crab that is received by an RCR will not be considered use of IPQ by an IPQ holder for the purposes of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, if the IPQ is subject to an exemption pursuant to ยง 680.4(p).

(c) *Vessel limitations.* (1) Except for vessels that participate solely in a crab harvesting cooperative as described under ยง 680.21 and under the provisions described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, no vessel may be used to harvest CVO or CPO IFQ in excess of the following percentages of the TAC for that crab QS fishery for that crab fishing year:

(i) 2.0 percent for BSS;

(ii) 2.0 percent for BBR;

(iii) 2.0 percent for EBT;

(iv) 2.0 percent for WBT;

(v) 4.0 percent for PIK;

(vi) 4.0 percent for SMB;

(vii) 20.0 percent for EAG;

(viii) 20.0 percent for WAG; or

(ix) 20.0 percent for the WAI crab QS fishery west of 179ยฐ W. long.

(2) CVC or CPC IFQ used on a vessel will not be included in determining whether a vessel use cap is met.

(3) A single person who receives an initial allocation of QS that results in IFQ that is in excess of the vessel use caps, in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, that person may catch and retain crab harvested with the resulting IFQ with a single vessel. However, this provision does not apply to IFQ resulting from QS derived from transfer of an LLP crab license that occurred after June 10, 2002. Two or more persons may not catch and retain their IFQ with one vessel in excess of these limitations.

(4) A vessel use cap would not apply to a vessel if all of the CVO or CPO IFQ used on that vessel in a crab fishing year is held by a crab harvesting cooperative. This exemption is forfeited if that vessel is used to harvest any amount of CVO or CPO IFQ not held by a crab harvesting cooperative during the same crab fishing year.

(5) A person holding a CVC or CPC IFQ permit is required to be aboard the vessel upon which their IFQ is being harvested.

(6) A person holding CVO or CPO QS does not have to be aboard the vessel being used to harvest their IFQ if they hold at least a 10 percent ownership interest in the vessel upon which the IFQ is to be harvested and are represented on board the vessel by a crab IFQ hired master employed by that QS holder as authorized under ยง 680.4.

(7) Ownership of a vessel means, for purposes of this section:

(i) A sole proprietor; or

(ii) A person that directly or indirectly owns a 10 percent or greater interest in an entity that owns a vessel.
