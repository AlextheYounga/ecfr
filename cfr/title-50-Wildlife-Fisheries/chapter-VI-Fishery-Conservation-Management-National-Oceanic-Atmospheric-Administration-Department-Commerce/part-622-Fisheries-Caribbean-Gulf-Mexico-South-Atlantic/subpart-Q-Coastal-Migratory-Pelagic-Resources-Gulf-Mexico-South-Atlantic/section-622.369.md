Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 17394, Apr. 11, 2017.

(a) *Migratory groups of king mackerel.* In the EEZ, king mackerel are divided into the Gulf migratory group and the Atlantic migratory group. The Gulf migratory group is bound by a line extending east of the U.S./Mexico border and the summer/winter jurisdictional boundary. The Atlantic migratory group is bound by the summer/winter jurisdictional boundary and a line from the intersection point of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter). From April 1 through October 31, the summer jurisdictional boundary separates the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel by a line extending due west from the Monroe/Collier County, FL, boundary. From November 1 through March 31, the winter jurisdictional boundary separates the Gulf and Atlantic migratory groups of king mackerel by a line extending due east from the Volusia/Flagler County, FL, boundary. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figures 1 and 2 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.

(1) *Gulf migratory group.* The Gulf migratory group is divided into western and eastern zones separated by a line extending due south from the Alabama/Florida border. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figures 1 and 2 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.

(i) *Western zone.* The western zone encompasses an area of the EEZ north of a line extending east of the US/Mexico border, and west of a line extending due south of the Alabama/Florida border, including the EEZ off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This zone remains the same year round.

(ii) *Eastern zone.* The eastern zone is divided into the Florida west coast subzone and the Florida east coast subzone.

(A) *Florida west coast subzone.* The Florida west coast subzone is further divided into the northern and southern subzones by a line extending due west from the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary.

(*1*) *Northern subzone.* The northern subzone encompasses an area of the EEZ east of a line extending due south of the Florida/Alabama border, and north of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary, and remains the same area year round.

(*2*) *Southern subzone.* From November 1 through March 31, the southern subzone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary on the Florida west coast, and south of a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary on the Florida east coast, which includes the EEZ off Collier and Monroe Counties, FL. From April 1 through October 31, the southern subzone is reduced to the EEZ off Collier County, and the EEZ off Monroe County becomes part of the Atlantic migratory group area.

(B) *Florida east coast subzone.* From November 1 through March 31, the Florida east coast subzone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending due east of the Flagler/Volusia County, FL, boundary, and north of a line extending due east of the Miami-Dade/Monroe County, FL, boundary. From April 1 through October 31, the Florida east coast subzone is not part of the Gulf migratory group king mackerel area; it is part of the Atlantic migratory group king mackerel area.

(2) *Atlantic migratory group.* The Atlantic migratory group is divided into the northern and southern zones separated by a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figures 1 and 2 in Appendix G of this part for illustration. See § 622.385(a)(1) for a description of the areas for Atlantic migratory group king mackerel commercial trip limits.

(i) *Northern zone.* The northern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter), and north of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, including the EEZ off each state from North Carolina to New York. This zone remains the same year round.

(ii) *Southern zone.* From April 1 through October 31, the southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, and south of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary. From November 1 through March 31, the southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, and north of a line extending due east of the Flagler/Volusia County, FL, boundary.
