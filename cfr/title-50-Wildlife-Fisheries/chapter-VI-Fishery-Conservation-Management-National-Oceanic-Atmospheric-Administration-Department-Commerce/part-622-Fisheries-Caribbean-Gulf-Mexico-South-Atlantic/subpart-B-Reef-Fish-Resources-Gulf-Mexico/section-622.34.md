(a) *Closure provisions applicable to the Madison and Swanson sites and Steamboat Lumps, and the Edges* - (1) *Descriptions of Areas.* (i) The Madison and Swanson sites are bounded by rhumb lines connecting, in order, the following points:

|Point|North lat.|West long.|
|-----|----------|----------|
|  A  |  29°17′  |  85°50′  |
|  B  |  29°17′  |  85°38′  |

|  A  |  29°17′  |  85°50′  |

(ii) Steamboat Lumps is bounded by rhumb lines connecting, in order, the following points:

|Point|North lat.|West long.|
|-----|----------|----------|
|  B  |  28°14′  |  84°37′  |
|  C  |  28°03′  |  84°37′  |
|  D  |  28°03′  |  84°48′  |
|  A  |  28°14′  |  84°48′  |

(iii) The Edges is bounded by rhumb lines connecting, in order, the following points:

|Point|North lat.|West long.|
|-----|----------|----------|
|  A  |  28°51′  |  85°16′  |
|  B  |  28°51′  |  85°04′  |
|  C  |  28°14′  |  84°42′  |
|  D  |  28°14′  |  84°54′  |
|  A  |  28°51′  |  85°16′  |

(2) Within the Madison and Swanson sites and Steamboat Lumps, possession of Gulf reef fish is prohibited, except for such possession aboard a vessel in transit with fishing gear stowed as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.

(3) Within the Madison and Swanson sites and Steamboat Lumps during November through April, and within the Edges during January through April, all fishing is prohibited, and possession of any fish species is prohibited, except for such possession aboard a vessel in transit with fishing gear stowed as specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph, (a)(3), do not apply to highly migratory species.

(4) For the purpose of paragraph (a) of this section, transit means non-stop progression through the area; fishing gear appropriately stowed means -

(i) A longline may be left on the drum if all gangions and hooks are disconnected and stowed below deck. Hooks cannot be baited. All buoys must be disconnected from the gear; however, buoys may remain on deck.

(ii) A trawl net may remain on deck, but trawl doors must be disconnected from the trawl gear and must be secured.

(iii) A gillnet must be left on the drum. Any additional gillnets not attached to the drum must be stowed below deck.

(iv) A rod and reel must be removed from the rod holder and stowed securely on or below deck. Terminal gear (*i.e.,* hook, leader, sinker, flasher, or bait) must be disconnected and stowed separately from the rod and reel. Sinkers must be disconnected from the down rigger and stowed separately.

(5) Within the Madison and Swanson sites and Steamboat Lumps, during May through October, surface trolling is the only allowable fishing activity. For the purpose of this paragraph (a)(5), surface trolling is defined as fishing with lines trailing behind a vessel which is in constant motion at speeds in excess of four knots with a visible wake. Such trolling may not involve the use of down riggers, wire lines, planers, or similar devices.

(6) For the purpose of this paragraph (a), fish means finfish, mollusks, crustaceans, and all other forms of marine animal and plant life other than marine mammals and birds. Highly migratory species means tuna species, marlin (*Tetrapturus spp.* and *Makaira spp.*), oceanic sharks, sailfishes (*Istiophorus spp.*), and swordfish (*Xiphias gladius*).

(b) *Seasonal closure of the recreational sector for red snapper.* The recreational sector for red snapper in or from the Gulf EEZ is closed from January 1 through May 31, each year. During the closure, the bag and possession limit for red snapper in or from the Gulf EEZ is zero.

(c) *Seasonal closure of the recreational sector for greater amberjack.* The recreational sector for greater amberjack in or from the Gulf EEZ is closed from June 1 through July 31, each year. During the closure, the bag and possession limit for greater amberjack in or from the Gulf EEZ is zero.

(d) *Seasonal closure of the recreational sector for shallow-water grouper (SWG).* The recreational sector for SWG, in or from the Gulf EEZ, is closed each year from February 1 through March 31, in the portion of the Gulf EEZ seaward of rhumb lines connecting, in order, the points in the following table. During the closure, the bag and possession limit for SWG in or from the Gulf EEZ seaward of the following rhumb lines is zero.
