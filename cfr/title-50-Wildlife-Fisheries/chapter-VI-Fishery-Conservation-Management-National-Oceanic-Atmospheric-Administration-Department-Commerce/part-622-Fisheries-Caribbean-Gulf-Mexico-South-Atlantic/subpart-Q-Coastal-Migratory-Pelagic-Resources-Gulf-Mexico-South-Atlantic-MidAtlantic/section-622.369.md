##### § 622.369 Description of zones. #####

(a) *Migratory groups of king mackerel.* In the EEZ, king mackerel are divided into the Gulf migratory group and the Atlantic migratory group. The Gulf migratory group is bound by a line extending east of the U.S./Mexico border and a line extending east of the Miami-Dade/Monroe County, FL, boundary. The Atlantic migratory group is bound by a line extending east of the Miami-Dade/Monroe County, FL, boundary and a line from the intersection point of Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter). The zone boundaries remain in place year round. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 1 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.

(1) *Gulf migratory group.* The Gulf migratory group is divided into western, northern, and southern zones. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 1 in Appendix G of this part for illustration.

(i) *Western zone.* The western zone encompasses an area of the EEZ north of a line extending east of the US/Mexico border, and west of a line extending due south of the Alabama/Florida border, including the EEZ off Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

(ii) *Northern zone.* The northern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ east of a line extending due south of the Florida/Alabama border, and north of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary.

(iii) *Southern zone.* The southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending due west of the Lee/Collier County, FL, boundary on the FL west coast, and south of a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary on the FL east coast, which includes the EEZ off Collier and Monroe Counties, FL.

(2) *Atlantic migratory group.* The Atlantic migratory group is divided into the northern and southern zones separated by a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2. See Table 1 of this section for the boundary coordinates. See Figure 1 in Appendix G of this part for illustration. See § 622.385(a)(1) for a description of the areas for Atlantic migratory group king mackerel commercial trip limits.

(i) *Northern zone.* The northern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the intersection point of New York, Connecticut, and Rhode Island (as described in § 600.105(a) of this chapter), and north of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, including the EEZ off each state from North Carolina to New York. This zone remains the same year round.

(ii) *Southern zone.* The southern zone encompasses an area of the EEZ south of a line extending from the North Carolina/South Carolina border, as specified in § 622.2, and north of a line extending due east of the Monroe/Miami-Dade County, FL, boundary.
