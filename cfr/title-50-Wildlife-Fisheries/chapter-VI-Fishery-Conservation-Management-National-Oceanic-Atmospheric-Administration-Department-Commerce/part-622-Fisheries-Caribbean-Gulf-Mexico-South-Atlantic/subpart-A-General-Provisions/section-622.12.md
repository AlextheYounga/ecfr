##### ยง 622.12 Annual catch limits (ACLs) and accountability measures (AMs) for Caribbean island management areas/Caribbean EEZ. #####

Link to an amendment published at 87 FR 56216, Sept. 13, 2022.

(a) *Puerto Rico management area.* See appendix E of this part for specification of the Puerto Rico management area.

(1) *Queen conch.* See ยง 622.491 regarding seasonal and area closure provisions and ACL closure provisions applicable to queen conch.

(i) *Commercial ACL.* For the EEZ only, 0 lb (0 kg), round weight.

(ii) *Recreational ACL.* For the EEZ only, 0 lb (0 kg), round weight.

(2) *Reef fish.* Landings will be evaluated relative to the applicable ACL based on a moving multi-year average of landings, as described in the FMP. With the exceptions of goliath grouper, Nassau grouper, midnight parrotfish, blue parrotfish, and rainbow parrotfish, ACLs are based on the combined Caribbean EEZ and territorial landings for the Puerto Rico management area. As described in the FMP, for each species or species group in this paragraph (a)(2), any fishing season reduction required under paragraph (a)(2)(i) or (ii) of this section will be applied from September 30 backward, toward the beginning of the fishing year. If the length of the required fishing season reduction exceeds the time period of January 1 through September 30, any additional fishing season reduction will be applied from October 1 forward, toward the end of the fishing year.

(i) *Commercial sector.* If commercial landings, as estimated by the SRD, have exceeded the applicable species or species group commercial ACL, as specified in this paragraph (a)(2)(i), and the combined commercial and recreational landings have exceeded the applicable combined commercial and recreational sector ACL (total ACL), as specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section, the AA will file a notification with the Office of the Federal Register, at or near the beginning of the following fishing year, to reduce the length of the fishing season for the applicable species or species groups for the commercial sector that year by the amount necessary to ensure that commercial landings do not exceed the applicable commercial ACL for the species or species group. If NMFS determines that either the applicable commercial ACL or total ACL for a particular species or species group was exceeded because of enhanced data collection and monitoring efforts instead of an increase in catch of the species or species group, NMFS will not reduce the length of the commercial fishing season for the applicable species or species group the following fishing year. The commercial ACLs, in round weight, are as follows:

(A) *Parrotfishes* - 52,737 lb (23,915 kg).
