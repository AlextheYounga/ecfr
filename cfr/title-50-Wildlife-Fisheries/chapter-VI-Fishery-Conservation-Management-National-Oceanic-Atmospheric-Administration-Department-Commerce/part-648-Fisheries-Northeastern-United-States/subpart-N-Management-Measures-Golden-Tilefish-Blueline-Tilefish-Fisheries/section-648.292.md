##### § 648.292 Tilefish specifications. #####

Link to an amendment published at 83 FR 10806, Mar. 13, 2018.

(a) *Golden Tilefish.* The golden tilefish fishing year is the 12-month period beginning with November 1, annually.

(1) *Annual specification process.* The Tilefish Monitoring Committee shall review the ABC recommendation of the SSC, golden tilefish landings and discards information, and any other relevant available data to determine if the golden tilefish ACL, ACT, or total allowable landings (TAL) requires modification to respond to any changes to the golden tilefish stock's biological reference points or to ensure that the rebuilding schedule is maintained. The Monitoring Committee will consider whether any additional management measures or revisions to existing measures are necessary to ensure that the TAL will not be exceeded. Based on that review, the Monitoring Committee will recommend golden tilefish ACL, ACT, and TAL to the Tilefish Committee of the MAFMC. Based on these recommendations and any public comment received, the Tilefish Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC the appropriate golden tilefish ACL, ACT, TAL, and other management measures for a single fishing year or up to three years. The MAFMC shall review these recommendations and any public comments received, and recommend to the Regional Administrator, at least 120 days prior to the beginning of the next fishing year, the appropriate golden tilefish ACL, ACT, TAL, the percentage of TAL allocated to research quota, and any management measures to ensure that the TAL will not be exceeded, for the next fishing year, or up to three fishing years. The MAFMC's recommendations must include supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review these recommendations, and after such review, NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register specifying the annual golden tilefish ACL, ACT, TAL and any management measures to ensure that the TAL will not be exceeded for the upcoming fishing year or years. After considering public comments, NMFS will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to implement the golden tilefish ACL, ACT, TAL and any management measures. The previous year's specifications will remain effective unless revised through the specification process and/or the research quota process described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section. NMFS will issue notification in the Federal Register if the previous year's specifications will not be changed.

(2) *Total Allowable Landings (TAL).* (i) The TAL for each fishing year will be specified pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

(ii) The sum of the TAL and the estimated discards shall be less than or equal to the ACT.

(3) *TAL allocation.* For each fishing year, up to three percent of the golden tilefish TAL may be set aside for the purpose of funding research. Once a research amount, if any, is set aside, the golden tilefish TAL will first be reduced by 5 percent to adjust for the incidental catch. The remaining TAL will be allocated to the individual IFQ permit holders as described in § 648.294(a).

(4) *Adjustments to the quota.* If the incidental harvest exceeds 5 percent of the golden tilefish TAL for a given fishing year, the incidental trip limit specified at § 648.295(a)(1) may be reduced in the following fishing year. If an adjustment is required, a notification of adjustment of the quota will be published in the Federal Register.

(5) *Research quota.* See § 648.22(g).

(b) *Blueline tilefish.* The blueline tilefish fishing year is the calendar year beginning on January 1, annually.

(1) *Recommended measures.* Based on annual review, the Tilefish Monitoring Committee shall recommend to the Tilefish Committee of the MAFMC measures to ensure that the ACLs specified by the process outlined in § 648.290(b), including:

(i) Total Allowable Landings (TAL) for both the commercial and recreational sectors for each fishing year, where the sum of the TAL and sector-specific estimated discards shall be less than or equal to the sector ACT;

(ii) Research quota for both the commercial and recreational sectors set from a range of 0 to three percent of the TAL, as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;

(iii) Commercial trip limit;

(iv) Commercial minimum fish size;

(v) Recreational possession limit;

(vi) Recreational minimum fish size;

(vii) Recreational season;

(viii) Retention requirements; and/or

(ix) Any other measure needed to ensure the ACLs are not exceeded.

(2) *Annual specification process.* The Tilefish Committee of the MAFMC shall review the recommendations of the Tilefish Monitoring Committee. Based on these recommendations and any public comment received, the Tilefish Committee shall recommend to the MAFMC the appropriate ACL, ACT, TAL, and other management measures for the blueline tilefish commercial and recreational sectors for a single fishing year or up to three years. The MAFMC shall review these recommendations and any public comments received, and recommend to the Regional Administrator, at least 120 days prior to the beginning of the next fishing year, the appropriate blueline tilefish ACLs, ACTs, TALs, the percentage of TAL allocated to research quota, and any management measures to ensure that the sector ACLs will not be exceeded, for the next fishing year, or up to three fishing years. The MAFMC's recommendations must include supporting documentation, as appropriate, concerning the environmental and economic impacts of the recommendations. The Regional Administrator shall review these recommendations, and after such review, NMFS will publish a proposed rule in the Federal Register specifying the annual blueline tilefish ACL, ACT, TAL and any management measures for the blueline tilefish commercial and recreational sectors to ensure that the sector ACLs will not be exceeded for the upcoming fishing year or years. After considering public comments, NMFS will publish a final rule in the Federal Register to implement the blueline tilefish commercial and recreational ACLs, ACTs, TALs and any management measures. The previous year's specifications will remain effective unless revised through the specification process and/or the research quota process described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. NMFS will issue notification in the Federal Register if the previous year's specifications will not be changed.

(3) *Research quota.* See § 648.22(g).
