(b) *Blueline tilefish* - (1) *Private recreational vessels.* Any person fishing from a vessel that is not fishing under a tilefish commercial or charter/party vessel permit issued pursuant to § 648.4(a)(12), may land up to three blueline tilefish per trip.

(2) *Uninspected for-hire vessels.* Anglers fishing onboard a for-hire vessel under a tilefish charter/party vessel permit issued pursuant to § 648.4(a)(12), which has not been issued a valid U.S. Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection may land up to five blueline tilefish per person per trip.

(3) *Inspected for-hire vessels.* Anglers fishing onboard a for-hire vessel under a tilefish charter/party vessel permit issued pursuant to § 648.4(a)(12), which has been issued a valid U.S. Coast Guard Certificate of Inspection may land up to seven blueline tilefish per person per trip.

(c) *Enforcement.* Tilefish harvested by vessels subject to the possession limits with more than one person on board may be pooled in one or more containers. Compliance with the golden tilefish possession limit will be determined by dividing the number of golden tilefish on board by the number of persons on board. Compliance with the blueline tilefish possession limit will be determined by dividing the number of blueline tilefish on board by the number of persons on board. The captain and crew of a party or charter boat are not counted in determining the possession limit. If there is a violation of the possession limit on board a vessel carrying more than one person, the violation shall be deemed to have been committed by the owner and operator of the vessel.
