The MS Coop Program is composed of motherships with MS permits and catcher vessels registered to a limited entry permit with an MS/CV endorsement and a valid declaration for limited entry, midwater trawl, Pacific whiting mothership sector. The MS Coop Program also includes vessels registered to a limited entry permit without an MS/CV endorsement if the vessel is authorized to harvest the MS sector's allocation and has a valid declaration for limited entry, midwater trawl, Pacific whiting mothership sector.

*Mutual agreement exception* means, for the purpose of § 660.150, subpart D, an agreement that allows the owner of an MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit to withdraw the permit's obligation of its catch history assignment to a permitted mothership processor, when mutually agreed to with the mothership processor, and to obligate to a different permitted mothership processor.

QP have the same species/species group and area designations as the QS from which they are issued.

*Quota share (QS)* means the amount of fishing quota for an individual species/species group and area expressed as a percentage of the annual allocation of fish to the Shorebased IFQ Program. The QS is used as the basis for the annual calculation and allocation of a QS permit owner's QP in the Shorebased IFQ Program.
