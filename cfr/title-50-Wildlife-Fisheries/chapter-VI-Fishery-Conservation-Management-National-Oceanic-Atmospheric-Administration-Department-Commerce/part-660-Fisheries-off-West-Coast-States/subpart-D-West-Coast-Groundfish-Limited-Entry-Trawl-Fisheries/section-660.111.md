Ex-vessel value shall be determined before any deductions are made for transferred or leased allocation, or for any goods or services.

The MS Coop Program is composed of motherships with MS permits and catcher vessels registered to a limited entry permit with an MS/CV endorsement and a valid declaration for limited entry, midwater trawl, Pacific whiting mothership sector. The MS Coop Program also includes vessels registered to a limited entry permit without an MS/CV endorsement if the vessel is authorized to harvest the MS sector's allocation and has a valid declaration for limited entry, midwater trawl, Pacific whiting mothership sector.

*Mutual agreement exception* means, for the purpose of § 660.150, subpart D, an agreement that allows the owner of an MS/CV-endorsed limited entry permit to withdraw the permit's obligation of its catch history assignment to a permitted mothership processor, when mutually agreed to with the mothership processor, and to obligate to a different permitted mothership processor.

QP have the same species/species group and area designations as the QS from which they are issued.

*Quota share (QS)* means the amount of fishing quota for an individual species/species group and area expressed as a percentage of the annual allocation of fish to the Shorebased IFQ Program. The QS is used as the basis for the annual calculation and allocation of a QS permit owner's QP in the Shorebased IFQ Program. Both QS and IBQ may be listed on a QS permit and in the associated QS account. Species for which QS will be issued for the Shorebased IFQ Program are listed at § 660.140, subpart D.
