Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 83363, Nov. 29, 2023.Link to an amendment published at 88 FR 83859, Dec. 1, 2023.

(a) *General.* Federal recreational groundfish regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive state recreational groundfish regulations relating to federally-managed groundfish. The bag limits include fish taken in both state and Federal waters.

(b) *Gear restrictions.* The only types of fishing gear authorized for recreational fishing are hook-and-line and spear. Spears may be propelled by hand or by mechanical means. More fishery-specific gear restrictions may be required by state as noted in paragraph (c) of this section (e.g., California's recreational “other flatfish” fishery).

(c) *State-specific recreational fishery management measures.* Federal recreational groundfish regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive State recreational groundfish regulations relating to federally-managed groundfish. Off the coast of Washington, Oregon, and California, boat limits apply, whereby each fisher aboard a vessel may continue to use angling gear until the combined daily limits of groundfish for all licensed and juvenile anglers aboard has been attained (additional state restrictions on boat limits may apply).

(1) *Washington.* For each person engaged in recreational fishing off the coast of Washington, the groundfish bag limit is 9 groundfish per day, including rockfish, cabezon and lingcod. Within the groundfish bag limit, there are sub-limits for rockfish, lingcod, and cabezon outlined in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(D) of this section. In addition to the groundfish bag limit of 9, there will be a flatfish limit of 5 fish, not to be counted towards the groundfish bag limit but in addition to it. The recreational groundfish fishery will open the second Saturday in March through the third Saturday in October for all species. In the Pacific halibut fisheries, retention of groundfish is governed in part by annual management measures for Pacific halibut fisheries, which are published in the Federal Register. The following seasons, closed areas, sub-limits and size limits apply:

(i) *Recreational groundfish conservation areas off Washington*—(A) *North coast recreational yelloweye rockfish conservation area.* Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is prohibited within the North Coast Recreational Yelloweye Rockfish Conservation Area (YRCA). It is unlawful for recreational fishing vessels to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the North Coast Recreational YRCA. A vessel fishing in the North Coast Recreational YRCA may not be in possession of any groundfish. Recreational vessels may transit through the North Coast Recreational YRCA with or without groundfish on board. The North Coast Recreational YRCA is defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at § 660.70, subpart C.

(B) *South coast recreational yelloweye rockfish conservation area.* Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is allowed within the South Coast Recreational YRCA. The South Coast Recreational YRCA is defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at § 660.70, subpart C.

(C) *Westport offshore recreational yelloweye rockfish conservation area.* Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is allowed within the Westport Offshore Recreational YRCA. The Westport Offshore Recreational YRCA is defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at § 660.70, subpart C.

(D) *Recreational rockfish conservation area.* Fishing for groundfish with recreational gear is prohibited within the recreational RCA unless otherwise stated. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the recreational RCA unless otherwise stated. A vessel fishing in the recreational RCA may not be in possession of any groundfish unless otherwise stated. [For example, if a vessel participates in the recreational salmon fishery within the RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of groundfish while in the RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip fish for and retain groundfish shoreward of the RCA on the return trip to port.] Coordinates approximating boundary lines at the 10-fm (18-m) through 100-fm (183-m) depth contours can be found at § 660.71 through § 660.73. The Washington recreational fishing season structure is as follows:

(ii) *Rockfish.* In areas of the EEZ seaward of Washington (Washington Marine Areas 1-4) that are open to recreational groundfish fishing, there is a 7 rockfish per day bag limit. Taking and retaining yelloweye rockfish is prohibited in all Marine Areas. Taking and retaining copper rockfish, quillback rockfish, and vermilion rockfish is prohibited in all Marine Areas during May, June and July.

(iii) *Cabezon.* In areas of the EEZ seaward of Washington (Washington Marine Areas 1-4) that are open to recreational groundfish fishing, there is a 1 cabezon per day bag limit.

(iv) *Lingcod.* In areas of the EEZ seaward of Washington (Washington Marine Areas 1-4) that are open to recreational groundfish fishing and when the recreational season for lingcod is open, there is a bag limit of 2 lingcod per day. The recreational fishing seasons for lingcod is open from the second Saturday in March through the third Saturday in October.

(2) *Oregon*—(i) *Recreational groundfish conservation areas off Oregon*—(A) *Stonewall Bank yelloweye rockfish conservation area.* Recreational fishing for groundfish and halibut is prohibited within the Stonewall Bank YRCA. It is unlawful for recreational fishing vessels to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the Stonewall Bank YRCA. A vessel fishing in the Stonewall Bank YRCA may not be in possession of any groundfish. Recreational vessels may transit through the Stonewall Bank YRCA with or without groundfish on board. The Stonewall Bank YRCA, and two possible expansions that are available through inseason adjustment, are defined by latitude and longitude coordinates specified at § 660.70, subpart C.

(B) *Recreational rockfish conservation area (RCA).* Fishing for groundfish with recreational gear is prohibited within the recreational RCA, a type of closed area or groundfish conservation area, except with long-leader gear (as defined at § 660.351). It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with recreational gear within the recreational RCA, except with long-leader gear (as defined at § 660.351). A vessel fishing in the recreational RCA may not be in possession of any groundfish unless otherwise stated. [For example, if a vessel fishes in the recreational salmon fishery within the recreational RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of groundfish while within the recreational RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip fish for and retain groundfish shoreward of the recreational RCA on the return trip to port.] Off Oregon, from January 1 through December 31, recreational fishing for groundfish is allowed in all depths. Coordinates approximating boundary lines at the 10-fm (18-m) through 100-fm (183-m) depth contours can be found at § 660.71 through § 660.73.

(C) *Essential fish habitat conservation areas.* The Essential Fish Habitat Conservation Areas (EFHCAs) are closed areas, defined by specific latitude and longitude coordinates at §§ 660.76 through 660.79, where specified types of fishing are prohibited. Prohibitions applying to specific EFHCAs are found at § 660.12.

(ii) *Seasons.* Recreational fishing for groundfish is open from January 1 through December 31, subject to the closed areas described in paragraph (c) of this section.

(iii) *Bag limits, size limits.* For each person engaged in recreational fishing off the coast of Oregon, the following bag limits apply:

(A) *Marine fish.* The bag limit is 10 marine fish per day, which includes rockfish, kelp greenling, cabezon and other groundfish species; except the daily bag limit in the long-leader gear fishery is 15 fish per day. The bag limit of marine fish excludes Pacific halibut, salmonids, tuna, perch species, sturgeon, sanddabs, flatfish, lingcod, striped bass, hybrid bass, offshore pelagic species and baitfish (herring, smelt, anchovies and sardines). The minimum size for cabezon retained in the Oregon recreational fishery is 16 in (41 cm) total length.

(B) *Lingcod.* There is a 3 fish limit per day for lingcod from January 1 through December 31. The minimum size for lingcod retained in the Oregon recreational fishery is 22 in (56 cm) total length. For vessels using long-leader gear (as defined in § 660.351) and fishing inside the recreational RCA, possession of lingcod is prohibited.

(C) *Flatfish.* There is a 25 fish limit per day for all flatfish, excluding Pacific halibut, but including all soles, flounders and Pacific sanddabs, from January 1 through December 31.

(D) *In the Pacific halibut fisheries.* Retention of groundfish is governed in part by annual management measures for Pacific halibut fisheries, which are published in the Federal Register. Between the Columbia River and Humbug Mountain, during days open to the “all-depth” sport halibut fisheries, when Pacific halibut are onboard the vessel, no groundfish, except sablefish, Pacific cod, and other species of flatfish (sole, flounder, sanddab), may be taken and retained, possessed or landed, except with long-leader gear (as defined at § 660.351). “All-depth” season days are established in the annual management measures for Pacific halibut fisheries, which are published in the Federal Register and are announced on the NMFS Pacific halibut hotline, 1-800-662-9825.

(E) Taking and retaining yelloweye rockfish is prohibited at all times and in all areas.

(3) *California.* Seaward of California, for groundfish species not specifically mentioned in this paragraph, fishers are subject to the overall 20-fish bag limit for all species of finfish, of which no more than 10 fish of any one species may be taken or possessed by any one person. Petrale sole, Pacific sanddab, and starry flounder are not subject to a bag limit. Recreational spearfishing for all federally-managed groundfish, is exempt from closed areas and seasons, consistent with Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations. This exemption applies only to recreational vessels and divers provided no other fishing gear, except spearfishing gear, is on board the vessel. California state law may provide regulations similar to Federal regulations for kelp greenlings. Retention of cowcod, yelloweye rockfish, quillback rockfish, and bronzespotted rockfish, is prohibited in the recreational fishery seaward of California all year in all areas. Retention of species or species groups for which the season is closed is prohibited in the recreational fishery seaward of California all year in all areas, unless otherwise authorized in this section. For each person engaged in recreational fishing in the EEZ seaward of California, the following closed areas, seasons, bag limits, and size limits apply:

(i) *Recreational groundfish conservation areas off California.* A Groundfish Conservation Area (GCA), a type of closed area, is a geographic area defined by coordinates expressed in degrees latitude and longitude. The following GCAs apply to participants in California's recreational fishery.

(A) *Recreational rockfish conservation areas.* The recreational RCAs are areas that are closed to recreational fishing for certain groundfish. Fishing for the California rockfish, cabezon, greenling complex (RCG Complex), as defined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, and lingcod with recreational gear is prohibited within the recreational RCA. It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land the RCG Complex and lingcod taken with recreational gear within the recreational RCA, unless otherwise authorized in this section. A vessel fishing in the recreational RCA may not be in possession of any species prohibited by the restrictions that apply within the recreational RCA. For example, if a vessel fishes in the recreational salmon fishery within the recreational RCA, the vessel cannot be in possession of the RCG Complex and lingcod while in the recreational RCA. The vessel may, however, on the same trip fish for and retain rockfish shoreward of the recreational RCA on the return trip to port. If the season is closed for a species or species group, fishing for that species or species group is prohibited both within the recreational RCA and outside of the recreational RCA, unless otherwise authorized in this section. In times and areas where a recreational RCA is closed shoreward of a recreational RCA line (*i.e.,* when an “off-shore only” fishery is active in that management area) possession or retention of nearshore rockfish (defined as black rockfish, blue rockfish, black and yellow rockfish, brown rockfish, China rockfish, copper rockfish, calico rockfish, gopher rockfish, kelp rockfish, grass rockfish, olive rockfish, quillback rockfish, and treefish), cabezon, and greenlings is prohibited in all depths throughout the area; and possession and retention of all rockfish, cabezon, greenlings, and lingcod is prohibited shoreward of the recreational RCA boundary line, except that vessels may transit through waters shoreward of the recreational RCA line with no fishing gear in the water. Coordinates approximating boundary lines at the 30 fm (55 m) through 100 fm (183 m) depth contours can be found at § 660.71 through § 660.73.
