##### § 660.16 Groundfish observer program. #####

(a) *General.* Vessel owners, operators, and managers are jointly and severally responsible for their vessel's compliance with observer requirements specified in this section and within §§ 660.140, 660.150, 660.160, 660.216, or 660.316.

(b) *Purpose.* The purpose of the Groundfish Observer Program is to collect fisheries data necessary and appropriate for, among other relevant purposes, management, compliance monitoring, and research in the groundfish fisheries and for the conservation of living marine resources.

(c) *Observer coverage requirements.* The following table provides references to the paragraphs in the Pacific coast groundfish subparts that contain fishery specific requirements.
