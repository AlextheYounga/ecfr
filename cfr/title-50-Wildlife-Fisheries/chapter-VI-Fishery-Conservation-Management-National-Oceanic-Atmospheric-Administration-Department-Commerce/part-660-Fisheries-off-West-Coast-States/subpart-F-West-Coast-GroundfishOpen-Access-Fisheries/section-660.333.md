##### § 660.333 Open access non-groundfish trawl fishery—management measures. #####

(a) *General.* Groundfish taken with non-groundfish trawl gear by vessels engaged in fishing for pink shrimp, ridgeback prawns, California halibut, or sea cucumbers. Trip limits for groundfish retained in the ridgeback prawn, California halibut, or sea cucumber fisheries are in the open access trip limit table, Table 3 (South) of this subpart. Trip limits for groundfish retained in the pink shrimp fishery are in Tables 3 (North) and 3 (South) of this subpart. The table also generally describes the RCAs for vessels participating in these fisheries.

(b) *Participation in the ridgeback prawn fishery.* A trawl vessel will be considered participating in the open access, non-groundfish trawl ridgeback prawn fishery if:

(1) It is declared “non-groundfish trawl gear for ridgeback prawn” under § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A)(*10*), regardless of whether it is registered to a Federal limited entry trawl-endorsed permit; and

(2) The landing includes ridgeback prawns taken in accordance with California Fish and Game Code, section 8595, which states: “Prawns or shrimp may be taken for commercial purposes with a trawl net, subject to Article 10 (commencing with Section 8830) of Chapter 3.”

(c) *Participation in the California halibut fishery.* A trawl vessel will be considered participating in the open access, non-groundfish trawl California halibut fishery if:

(1) It is declared “non-groundfish trawl gear for California halibut” under § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A)(*11*), regardless of whether it is registered to a Federal limited entry trawl-endorsed permit;

(2) All fishing on the trip takes place south of Pt. Arena, CA (38°57.50′ N. lat.); and

(3) The landing includes California halibut of a size required by California Fish and Game Code section 8392, which states: “No California halibut may be taken, possessed or sold which measures less than 22 in (56 cm) in total length. Total length means the shortest distance between the tip of the jaw or snout, whichever extends farthest while the mouth is closed, and the tip of the longest lobe of the tail, measured while the halibut is lying flat in natural repose, without resort to any force other than the swinging or fanning of the tail.”

(d) *Participation in the sea cucumber fishery.* A trawl vessel will be considered to be participating in the open access, non-groundfish trawl sea cucumber fishery if:

(1) It is declared “non-groundfish trawl gear for sea cucumber” under § 660.13(d)(4)(iv)(A)(*12*), regardless of whether it is registered to a Federal limited entry trawl-endorsed permit;

(2) All fishing on the trip takes place south of Pt. Arena, CA (38°57.50′ N. lat.); and

(3) The landing includes sea cucumbers taken in accordance with California Fish and Game Code, section 8405, which requires a permit issued by the State of California.

(e) *Groundfish taken with non-groundfish trawl gear by vessels engaged in fishing for pink shrimp.* Notwithstanding § 660.60(h)(7), a vessel that takes and retains pink shrimp and also takes and retains groundfish in either the limited entry or another open access fishery during the same applicable cumulative limit period that it takes and retains pink shrimp (which may be 1 month or 2 months, depending on the fishery and the time of year), may retain the larger of the two limits, but only if the limit(s) for each gear or fishery are not exceeded when operating in that fishery or with that gear. The limits are not additive; the vessel may not retain a separate trip limit for each fishery.
