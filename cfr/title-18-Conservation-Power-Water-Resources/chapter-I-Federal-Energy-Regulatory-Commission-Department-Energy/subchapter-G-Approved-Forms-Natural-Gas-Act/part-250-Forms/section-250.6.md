(c) Location and designation of each point of connection of your proposed transmission facilities with proposed pipeline supplier;

(d) And if known, location, length and size of facilities to be installed by the proposed supplier.

*Exhibit B.* A flow diagram showing the maximum daily capacity of the proposed connecting pipeline to carry gas from the supplier to the community to be served. The diagram should show expected operating pressures on the connecting pipeline at the point of connection with the supplier and at the other terminal of the connecting pipeline flow of gas through the connecting pipeline in Mcf per day; length of the connecting pipeline and its inside and outside diameter.
