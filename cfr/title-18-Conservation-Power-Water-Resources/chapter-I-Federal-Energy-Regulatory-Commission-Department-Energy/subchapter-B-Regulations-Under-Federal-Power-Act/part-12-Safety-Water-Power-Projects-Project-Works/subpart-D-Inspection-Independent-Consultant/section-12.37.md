(ii) A map of the region indicating the location of the project development;

(iii) Plans, elevations, and sections of the principal project works;

(iv) A summary of the design assumptions, design analyses, spillway design flood, and the factors of safety used to evaluate the structural adequacy and stability of the project works; and

(v) A summary of the geological conditions that may affect the safety of the project works.

(2) To the extent that the information and analyses required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, are contained in a report of an independent consultant prepared and filed in compliance with Commission regulations in effect before March 1, 1981 the information and analyses may be incorporated by specific reference into the first report prepared and filed under this subpart.

(1) *Monitoring information.* The report must contain monitoring information that includes time-versus-reading graphs depicting data compiled from any existing critical or representative monitoring instruments that measure the behavior, movement, deflection, or loading of project works or from which the stability, performance, or functioning of the structures may be determined.

(i) Any monitoring data plotted on graphs must be presented in a manner that will facilitate identification and analysis of trends. The data may be summarized to facilitate graphical representation.

(ii) Plan and sectional drawings of project structures sufficient to show the location of all critical or representative existing monitoring instruments must be included. If these drawings have been included in a previous report prepared and filed by an independent consultant, they may be incorporated by specific reference to that earlier report.

(2) *Analyses.* The report must:

(i) Analyze the safety of the project works and the maintenance and methods of operation of the development fully in light of the independent consultant's reviews, field inspections, assessments, and evaluations described in ยง 12.35;

(ii) Identify any changes in the information and analyses required by paragraph (b) of this section that have occurred since the last report by an independent consultant under this subpart and analyze the implications of those changes; and

(iii) Analyze the adequacy of existing monitoring instruments, periodic observation programs, and other methods of monitoring project works and conditions effecting the safety of the project or project works with respect to the development.

(3) *Incorporation by reference.* To the extent that conditions, assumptions, and available information have not changed since the last previous report by an independent consultant under this subpart, the analyses required under paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section may be incorporated by specific reference to the last previous report.

(i) Any corrective measures necessary for the structures or for the maintenance or surveillance procedures or methods of operation of the project works;

(ii) A reasonable time to carry out each corrective measure; and

(iii) Any new or additional monitoring instruments, periodic observations, or other methods of monitoring project works or conditions that may be required.

(5) *Dissenting views.* If the inspection and report were conducted and prepared by more than one independent consultant, the report must clearly indicate any dissenting views concerning the analyses or recommendations of the report that might be held by any individual consultant.

(6) *List of participants.* The report must identify all professional personnel who have participated in the inspection of the project or in preparation of the report and the independent consultant who directed those activities.
