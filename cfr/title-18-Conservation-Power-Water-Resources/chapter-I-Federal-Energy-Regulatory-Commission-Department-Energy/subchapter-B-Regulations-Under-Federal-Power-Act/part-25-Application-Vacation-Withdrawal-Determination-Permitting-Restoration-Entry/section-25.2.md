##### § 25.2 Hearings. #####

A hearing upon such an application may be ordered by the Commission in its discretion and shall be in accordance with the provisions of subpart E of part 385 of this chapter.

Note 1:

On April 17, 1922, the Commission made the following general determination:

(a) That where lands of the United States have heretofore been, or hereafter may be, reserved or classified as power sites, such reservation or classification being made solely because such lands are either occupied by power transmission lines or their occupancy and use for such purposes has been applied for or authorized under appropriate laws of the United States, and such lands have otherwise no value for power purposes, and are not occupied in trespass, the Commission determines that the value of such lands so reserved or classified, or so applied for or authorized, will not be injured or destroyed for the purposes of power development by location, entry, or selection under the public land laws, subject to the reservation of section 24 of the Federal Water Power Act (41 Stat. 1075; 16 U.S.C. 818).

(b) That when notice is given to the Secretary of the Interior of reservations made under the provisions of section 24 of the Federal Water Power Act, such notice shall indicate what lands so reserved, if any, may, in accordance with the determination of the preceding paragraph, be declared open to location, entry, or selection, subject to the reservation of said section 24. Second Annual Report, page 128.

Note 2:

On February 16, 1937, the Commission took the following action:

Consent to Establishment of Grazing Districts, Issuance of Grazing Permits, and Leasing for Grazing Purposes Under the Act of June 28, 1934, as Amended, Government Lands Reserved for Power Purposes

Upon request under date of November 2, 1936, by the acting director, Division of Grazing, Department of the Interior, for consent of the Commission, pursuant to the act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269), to the establishment of grazing districts and the issuance of grazing permits on lands of the United States withdrawn, classified, or otherwise reserved for power purposes, except in those instances where grazing will interfere with such purposes; and

Upon request under date of December 7, 1936, by the Acting Secretary of the Interior for consent of the Commission, pursuant to the Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269), as amended by the Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1976), to the leasing under section 15 of said Act as amended, of isolated tracts of lands of the United States, withdrawn for power purposes:

The Commission upon consideration of the matter finds and determines: That the establishment of grazing districts, the issuance of grazing permits, and the leasing for grazing purposes, under said Act as amended, of lands of the United States theretofore or thereafter withdrawn, classified or otherwise reserved for power purposes, but not including lands embraced within the project area of any power project theretofore licensed by the Commission or otherwise authorized by the United States, will not injure or destroy the value of such lands for the purposes of power development nor otherwise abridge the jurisdiction of the Commission; Provided, That such grazing districts shall be established and such permits and leases for grazing permits issued subject to the following conditions:

(1) That the establishment of the grazing district or the issuance of the grazing permit or lease for grazing purposes shall in no wise diminish or affect the jurisdiction of the Commission at any time to issue permits or licenses pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Power Act (49 Stat. 838; 16 U.S.C., Sup., 791-819); and that the issuance by the Commission of a license shall immediately and automatically terminate such grazing district, permit, or lease for grazing purposes as to all lands within the project area described in such license;

(2) That the establishment of the grazing district or the issuance of the grazing permit or lease for grazing purposes involving lands withdrawn for power purposes shall in no wise diminish or affect the jurisdiction of the Commission at any time to make further determinations that the value of any such lands for the purposes of power development will not be injured or destroyed by location entry or selection, as provided by section 24 of the Act and none of such lands shall be declared open, otherwise than as hereinbefore provided, to location, entry or selection except upon such further determination by the Commission; and any such further determination shall immediately and automatically terminate such grazing district, permit, or lease for grazing purposes as to any lands involved in such further determination.

Now, therefore, the Commission consents to the establishment of such grazing districts and the issuance of grazing permits and leases for grazing purposes of lands of the United States reserved for power purposes subject to the conditions hereinabove set out;

Provided, however, That this determination and consent shall be effective for lands embraced within grazing districts, as of the date of the establishment of such districts, and for isolated tracts of lands leased for grazing purposes, it shall be in effect when such leases are issued, provided that notice thereof is received by this Commission from the Bureau of Land Management, Department of the Interior, within 30 days thereafter, such notice to include full legal description of the lands, withdrawn for power purposes which are involved.
