(1) A detailed description of any conduits and associated consumptive water supply facilities, intake facilities, powerhouses, and any other structures associated with the facility;

(2) The purposes for which the conduit is used;

(3) The number, type, generating capacity (kW or MW), and estimated average annual generation (kWh or MWh) of the generating units and brief description of any plans for future units; and,

(4) A description of the nature and extent of the dam that would occur in association with construction of the proposed qualifying conduit hydroelectric facility, including a statement of the normal maximum surface area and normal maximum surface elevation of any existing impoundment before and after that construction; and any evidence that the construction of the dam would occur for agricultural, municipal, or industrial consumptive purposes even if the hydropower generating facilities were not installed.

(f) *Drawings, maps, diagrams.* Include a set of drawings/maps/diagrams showing the structures and equipment of the hydropower facility in relation to the existing conduit. Drawings of the facility must include:
