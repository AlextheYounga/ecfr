(b) *Exhibit B—State authorization.* For each State where the applicant is authorized to do business, a statement showing the date of authorization, the scope of the business the applicant is authorized to carry on and all limitations, if any, including expiration dates and renewal obligations. A conformed copy of applicant's authorization to do business in each State affected must be supplied upon request.

(c) *Exhibit C—Company officials.* A list of the names and business addresses of the applicant's officers and directors, or similar officials if the applicant is not a corporation.

(d) *Exhibit D—Other pending applications and filings.* A list of other applications and filings submitted by the applicant that are pending before the Commission at the time of the filing of an application and that directly and significantly affect the proposed project, including an explanation of any material effect the grant or denial of those other applications and filings will have on the application and of any material effect the grant or denial of the application will have on those other applications and filings.

(e) *Exhibit E—Maps of general location of facilities.* The general location map required under § 50.5(c) must be provided as Exhibit E. Detailed maps required by other exhibits must be filed in those exhibits, in a format determined during the pre-filing process in § 50.5.

(f) *Exhibit F—Environmental report.* An environmental report as specified in §§ 380.3 and 380.16 of this chapter. The applicant must submit all appropriate revisions to Exhibit F whenever route or site changes are filed. These revisions must identify the locations by mile post and describe all other specific differences resulting from the route or site changes, and should not simply provide revised totals for the resources affected. The format of the environmental report filing will be determined during the pre-filing process required under § 50.5.

(i) Number of circuits, with identification as to whether the circuit is overhead or underground;

(ii) The operating voltage and frequency; and

(iii) Conductor size, type and number of conductors per phase.

(i) The wind and ice loading design parameters;

(ii) A full description and drawing of a typical supporting structure including strength specifications;

(iii) Structure spacing with typical ruling and maximum spans;

(iv) Conductor (phase) spacing; and

(v) The designed line-to-ground and conductor-side clearances.

(6) If an underground or underwater interconnection is proposed, the following additional information also must be provided:

(i) Burial depth;

(ii) Type of cable and a description of any required supporting equipment, such as insulation medium pressurizing or forced cooling;

(iii) Cathodic protection scheme; and

(iv) Type of dielectric fluid and safeguards used to limit potential spills in waterways.

(7) Technical diagrams that provide clarification of any of the above items should be included.

(8) Any other data or information not previously identified that has been identified as a minimum requirement for the siting of a transmission line in the State in which the facility will be located.

(h) *Exhibit H—System analysis data.* An analysis evaluating the impact the proposed facilities will have on the existing electric transmission system performance, including:

(1) An analysis of the existing and expected congestion on the electric transmission system.

(2) Power flow cases used to analyze the proposed and future transmission system under anticipated load growth, operating conditions, variations in power import and export levels, and additional transmission facilities required for system reliability. The cases must:

(i) Provide all files to model normal, single contingency, multiple contingency, and special protective systems, including the special protective systems' automatic switching or load shedding system; and

(ii) State the assumptions, criteria, and guidelines upon which they are based and take into consideration transmission facility loading; first contingency incremental transfer capability (FCITC); normal incremental transfer capability (NITC); system protection; and system stability.
