##### § 50.8 Acceptance/rejection of applications. #####

(a) Applications will be docketed when received and the applicant so advised.

(b) If an application patently fails to comply with applicable statutory requirements or with applicable Commission rules, regulations, and orders for which a waiver has not been granted, the Director may reject the application as provided by § 385.2001(b) of this chapter. This rejection is without prejudice to an applicant's refiling a complete application. However, an application will not be rejected solely on the basis that the environmental reports are incomplete because the company has not been granted access by affected landowners to perform required surveys.

(c) An application that relates to a proposed project or modification for which a prior application has been filed and rejected, will be docketed as a new application.
