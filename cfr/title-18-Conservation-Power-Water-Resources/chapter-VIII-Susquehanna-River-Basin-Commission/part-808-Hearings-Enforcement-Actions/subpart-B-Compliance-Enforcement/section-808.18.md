(a) An alleged violator may offer to settle an enforcement proceeding by agreement. The Executive Director shall submit to the Commission any offer of settlement proposed by an alleged violator. No settlement will be submitted to the Commission by the Executive Director unless the alleged violator has indicated, in writing, acceptance of the terms of the agreement and the intention to comply with all requirements of the settlement agreement, including advance payment of any settlement amount or completion of any abatement or remedial action within the time period provided or both. If the Commission determines not to approve a settlement agreement, the Commission may proceed with an enforcement action in accordance with this subpart.

(b) In the event the violator fails to carry out any of the terms of the settlement agreement, the Commission may reinstitute a civil penalty action and any other applicable enforcement action against the alleged violator.
