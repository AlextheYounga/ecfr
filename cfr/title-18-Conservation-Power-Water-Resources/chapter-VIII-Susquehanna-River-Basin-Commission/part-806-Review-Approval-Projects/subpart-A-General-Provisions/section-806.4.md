##### § 806.4 Projects requiring review and approval. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 29390, June 29, 2017.

(a) Except for activities relating to site evaluation or those authorized under § 806.34, no person shall undertake any of the following projects without prior review and approval by the Commission. The project sponsor shall submit an application in accordance with subpart B and shall be subject to the applicable standards in subpart C.

(1) *Consumptive use of water.* Any consumptive use project described below shall require an application to be submitted in accordance with § 806.13, and shall be subject to the standards set forth in § 806.22, and, to the extent that it involves a withdrawal from groundwater or surface water, shall also be subject to the standards set forth in § 806.23. Except to the extent that they involve the diversion of the waters of the basin, public water supplies shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding consumptive use; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt individual consumptive users connected to any such public water supply from the requirements of this section. Provided the commission determines that low flow augmentation projects sponsored by the commission's member states provide sufficient mitigation for agricultural water use to meet the standards set forth in § 806.22, and except as otherwise provided below, agricultural water use projects shall not be subject to the requirements of this paragraph (a)(1). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an agricultural water use project involving a diversion of the waters of the basin shall be subject to such requirements unless the property, or contiguous parcels of property, upon which the agricultural water use project occurs is located at least partially within the basin.

(i) Any project initiated on or after January 23, 1971, involving a consumptive water use of an average of 20,000 gallons per day (gpd) or more in any consecutive 30-day period.

(ii) With respect to projects previously approved by the Commission for consumptive use, any project that will involve an increase in a consumptive use above that amount which was previously approved.

(iii) With respect to projects that existed prior to January 23, 1971, any project that increases its consumptive use by an average of 20,000 gpd or more in any consecutive 30-day period above its pre-compact consumptive use.

(iv) Any project, regardless of when initiated, involving a consumptive use of an average of 20,000 gpd or more in any 30-day period, and undergoing a change of ownership, unless such project satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section or the existing Commission approval for such project is transferred pursuant to § 806.6.

(2) *Withdrawals.* Any project described below shall require an application to be submitted in accordance with § 806.13, and shall be subject to the standards set forth in § 806.23. Hydroelectric projects, except to the extent that such projects involve a withdrawal, shall be exempt from the requirements of this section regarding withdrawals; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as exempting hydroelectric projects from review and approval under any other category of project requiring review and approval as set forth in this section, § 806.5, or 18 CFR part 801. The taking or removal of water by a public water supplier indirectly through another public water supply system or another water user's facilities shall constitute a withdrawal hereunder.

(i) Any project initiated on or after the applicable dates specified in paragraph (a)(2)(iv) below, withdrawing a consecutive 30-day average of 100,000 gpd or more from a groundwater or surface water source, or a combination of such sources.

(ii) With respect to projects previously approved by the Commission, any project that increases a withdrawal above that amount which was previously approved and any project that will add a source or increase withdrawals from an existing source which did not require approval prior to January 1, 2007.

(iii) Any project which involves a withdrawal from a groundwater or surface water source and which is subject to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section regarding consumptive use.

(iv) With respect to groundwater projects in existence prior to July 13, 1978, and surface water projects in existence prior to November 11, 1995, any project that will increase its withdrawal from any source, or initiate a withdrawal from a new source, or combination of sources, by a consecutive 30-day average of 100,000 gpd or more, above that maximum consecutive 30-day amount which the project was withdrawing prior to the said applicable date.

(v) Any project, regardless of when initiated, involving a withdrawal of a consecutive 30-day average of 100,000 gpd or more, from either groundwater or surface water sources, or in combination from both, and undergoing a change of ownership, unless such project satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section or the existing Commission approval for such project is transferred pursuant to § 806.6.

(3) *Diversions.* Except with respect to agricultural water use projects not subject to the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the projects described in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (a)(3)(iv) of this section shall require an application to be submitted in accordance with § 806.13, and shall be subject to the standards set forth in § 806.24. The project sponsors of out-of-basin diversions shall also comply with all applicable requirements of this part relating to consumptive uses and withdrawals. The projects identified in paragraphs (a)(3)(v) and (a)(3)(vi) of this section shall be subject to regulation pursuant to § 806.22(f).

(i) Any project initiated on or after January 23, 1971, involving the diversion of water into the basin, or involving a diversion of water out of the basin of an average of 20,000 gallons of water per day or more in any consecutive 30-day period.

(ii) With respect to diversions previously approved by the Commission, any project that will increase a diversion above the amount previously approved.

(iii) With respect to diversions initiated prior to January 23, 1971, any project that will increase a diversion into the basin by any amount, or increase the diversion of water out of the basin by an average of 20,000 gpd or more in any consecutive 30-day period.

(iv) Any project, regardless of when initiated, involving the diversion of water into the basin or involving a diversion of an average of 20,000 gallons of water per day or more in any consecutive 30-day period out of the basin, and undergoing a change of ownership, unless such project satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b) or (c) of this section or the Commission approval for such project is transferred pursuant to § 806.6.

(v) The interbasin diversion of any flowback or production fluids from hydrocarbon development projects from one drilling pad site to another drilling pad site for use in hydrofracture stimulation, provided it is handled, transported and stored in compliance with all standards and requirements of the applicable member jurisdiction, shall not be subject to separate review and approval as a diversion under this paragraph if the generating or receiving pad site is subject to an Approval by Rule issued pursuant to § 806.22(f) and provided all monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to such approval are met.

(vi) The diversion of flowback or production fluids from a hydrocarbon development project for which an Approval by Rule has been issued pursuant to § 806.22(f), to an out-of-basin treatment or disposal facility authorized under separate governmental approval to accept flowback or production fluids, shall not be subject to separate review and approval as a diversion under this paragraph, provided all monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to the Approval by Rule are met and it is handled, transported and stored in compliance with all standards and requirements of the applicable member jurisdiction.

(4) Any project on or crossing the boundary between two member states.

(5) Any project in a member state having a significant effect on water resources in another member state.

(6) Any project which has been or is required to be included by the Commission in its comprehensive plan, or will have a significant effect upon the comprehensive plan.

(7) Any other project so determined by the commissioners or Executive Director pursuant to § 806.5 or 18 CFR part 801. Such project sponsors shall be notified in writing by the Executive Director.

(8) Any unconventional natural gas development project in the basin involving a withdrawal, diversion or consumptive use, regardless of the quantity.

(9) Any project subject to coverage under a general permit issued under § 806.17.

(b) Any project that did not require Commission approval prior to January 1, 2007, and undergoing a change of ownership, shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(iv), (a)(2)(v) or (a)(3)(iv) of this section if it satisfies any of the following categories:

(1) A corporate reorganization of the following types:

(i) Where property is transferred to a corporation by one or more corporations solely in exchange for stock or securities of the transferee corporation, provided that immediately after the exchange the transferor corporation(s) own 80 percent of the voting stock and 80 percent of all other stock of the transferee corporation.

(ii) Where the corporate reorganization is merely a result of a change of the name, identity, internal corporate structure or place of organization and does not affect ownership or control.

(2) Transfer of a project to the transferor's spouse or one or more lineal descendents, or any spouse of such lineal descendents, or to a corporation owned or controlled by the transferor, or the transferor's spouse or lineal descendents, or any spouse of such lineal descendents, for so long as the combined ownership interest of the transferor, the transferor's spouse and/or the transferor's lineal descendent(s) and their spouses, continues to be 51 percent or greater.

(3) Transfer of land used primarily for the raising of food, fiber or forage crops, trees, flowers, shrubs, turf products, livestock, or poultry, or for aquaculture, to the extent that, and for so long as, the project's water use continues to be for such agricultural water use purposes.

(c) Any project that did not require Commission approval prior to January 1, 2007, and not otherwise exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a)(1)(iv), (a)(2)(v), or (a)(3)(iv) of this section, pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section, may be undertaken by a new project sponsor upon a change of ownership pending action on a transfer application under § 806.6.
