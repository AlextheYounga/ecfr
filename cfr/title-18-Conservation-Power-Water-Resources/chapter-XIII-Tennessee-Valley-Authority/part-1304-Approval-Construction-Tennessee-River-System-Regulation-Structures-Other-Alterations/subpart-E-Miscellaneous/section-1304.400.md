Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 50636, Sept. 10, 2021.

(a) All flotation for docks, boat mooring buoys, and other water-use structures and facilities, shall be of materials commercially manufactured for marine use. Flotation materials shall be fabricated so as not to become water-logged, crack, peel, fragment, or be subject to loss of beads. Flotation materials shall be resistant to puncture, penetration, damage by animals, and fire. Any flotation within 40 feet of a line carrying fuel shall be 100 percent impervious to water and fuel. Styrofoam floatation must be fully encased. Reuse of plastic, metal, or other previously used drums or containers for encasement or flotation purpose is prohibited, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section for certain metal drums already in use. Existing flotation (secured in place prior to September 8, 2003) in compliance with previous rules is authorized until in TVA's judgment the flotation is no longer serviceable, at which time it shall be replaced with approved flotation upon notification from TVA. For any float installed after September 8, 2003, repair or replacement is required when it no longer performs its designated function or exhibits any of the conditions prohibited by this subpart.

(b) Because of the possible release of toxic or polluting substances, and the hazard to navigation from metal drums that become partially filled with water and escape from docks, boathouses, houseboats, floats, and other water-use structures and facilities for which they are used for flotation, the use of metal drums in any form, except as authorized in paragraph (c) of this section, for flotation of any facilities is prohibited.

(c) Only metal drums which have been filled with plastic foam or other solid flotation materials and welded, strapped, or otherwise firmly secured in place prior to July 1, 1972, on existing facilities are permitted. Replacement of any metal drum flotation permitted to be used by this paragraph must be with a commercially manufactured flotation device or material specifically designed for marine applications (for example, pontoons, boat hulls, or other buoyancy devices made of steel, aluminum, fiberglass, or plastic foam, as provided for in paragraph (a) of this section).

(d) Every flotation device employed in the Tennessee River system must be firmly and securely affixed to the structure it supports with materials capable of withstanding prolonged exposure to wave wash and weather conditions.
