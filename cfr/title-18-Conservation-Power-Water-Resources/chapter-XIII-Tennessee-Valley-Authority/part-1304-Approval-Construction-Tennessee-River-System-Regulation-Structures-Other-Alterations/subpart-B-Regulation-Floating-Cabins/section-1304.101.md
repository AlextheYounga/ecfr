##### § 1304.101 Floating cabins. #####

(a)(1) Floating cabins include nonnavigable houseboats approved by TVA on or before December 16, 2016, and other floating structures moored on the Tennessee River System as of this date, and determined by TVA in its sole discretion to be designed and used primarily for human habitation or occupation and not designed and used primarily for navigation or transportation on the water. TVA's judgment will be guided by, but not limited to, the following factors:

(i) Whether the structure is usually kept at a fixed mooring point;

(ii) Whether the structure is actually used on a regular basis for transportation or navigation;

(iii) Whether the structure has a permanent or continuous connection to the shore for electrical, plumbing, water, or other utility service;

(iv) Whether the structure has the performance characteristics of a vessel typically used for navigation or transportation on water;

(v) Whether the structure can be readily removed from the water;

(vi) Whether the structure is used for intermittent or extended human-habitation or occupancy;

(vii) Whether the structure clearly has a means of propulsion, and appropriate power/size ratio;

(viii) Whether the structure is safe to navigate or use for transportation purposes.

(2) That a structure could occasionally move from place to place, or that it qualifies under another federal or state regulatory program as a vessel or boat, are factors that TVA also will consider but would not be determinative. Floating cabins are not recreational vessels to which § 1304.409 applies.

(b)(1) Owners of floating cabins are required to register the floating cabin with TVA before January 1, 2020. Floating cabin owners must submit certain required information with their registration. Registration shall include the following information: Clear and current photographs of the structure; a drawing or drawings showing in reasonable detail the size and shape of the floating cabin (length, width, and height) and attached structures, such as decks or slips (length, width, and height); and a completed and signed TVA registration form. The completed TVA registration form shall include the mailing and contact information of the owner(s); the TVA permit or TVA-issued numbers (when applicable); the mooring location of the floating cabin; how the floating cabin is moored; how electrical service is provided; how waste water and sewage is managed; and an owner's signature.

(2) Existing floating cabins may remain on TVA reservoirs provided they stay in compliance with the rules contained in this part and pay any necessary and reasonable fees levied by TVA to ensure compliance with TVA's regulations. Existing floating cabins must be moored at one of the following locations:

(i) To the bank of the reservoir at locations where the owner of the floating cabin is the owner or lessee (or the licensee of such owner or lessee) of the proposed mooring location provided the floating cabin was moored at such location prior to December 16, 2016;

(ii) At locations described by § 1304.201(a)(1), (2), and (3) provided the floating cabin was moored at such location prior to December 16, 2016;

(iii) To the bank of the reservoir at locations where the owner of the floating cabin obtained written approval from TVA pursuant to subpart A of this part authorizing mooring at such location on or before December 16, 2016; or

(iv) Within the designated and approved harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404. As provided in § 1304.404, TVA may adjust harbor limits and require relocation of an existing floating cabin within the harbor limits. Accordingly, in the case of relocations that occur after December 16, 2016, an existing floating cabin can relocate only to the harbor limits of a commercial marina that complies with § 1304.404.

(3) All floating cabins must be moored in such a manner as to:

(i) Avoid obstruction of or interference with navigation, flood control, public lands or reservations;

(ii) Avoid adverse effects on public lands or reservations;

(iii) Prevent the preemption of public waters when moored in permanent locations outside of the approved harbor limits of commercial marinas;

(iv) Protect land and landrights owned by the United States alongside and subjacent to TVA reservoirs from trespass and other unlawful and unreasonable uses; and

(v) Maintain, protect, and enhance the quality of the human environment.

(c) All approved floating cabins with toilets must be equipped as follows with a properly installed and operating Marine Sanitation Device (MSD) or Sewage Holding Tank and pumpout capability:

(1) Floating cabins moored on “Discharge Lakes” must be equipped with a Type I or Type II MSD.

(2) Floating cabins moored in: “No Discharge Lakes” must be equipped with holding tanks and pumpout capability. If a floating cabin moored in a “No Discharge Lake” is equipped with a Type I or Type II MSD, it must be secured to prevent discharge into the lake.

(d) Existing floating cabins shall be maintained in a good state of repair and may be maintained without additional approval from TVA. Existing floating cabins may be rebuilt to the same configuration, total footprint, and dimensions (length, width, and height) as permitted without additional TVA approval. Owners are required to notify TVA thirty days in advance and submit their proposed plans for rebuilding the floating cabin. Within thirty days of completion, owners must submit a photo of the rebuilt floating cabin for TVA's records. Any expansion in length, width, or height is prohibited, except as approved in writing by TVA and necessary to comply with health, safety, and environmental requirements.

(e) All floating cabins shall comply with the requirements for flotation devices contained in § 1304.400.

(f) Applications for mooring of a floating cabin outside of designated harbor limits will be disapproved if TVA determines that the proposed mooring location would be contrary to the intent of this subpart.

(g) All floating cabins not in compliance with this part are subject to the applicable removal provisions of § 1304.406 and Section 9b of the TVA Act.
