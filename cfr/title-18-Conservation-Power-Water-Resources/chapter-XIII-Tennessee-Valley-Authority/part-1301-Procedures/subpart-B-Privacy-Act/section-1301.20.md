##### § 1301.20 Disclosure of record to persons other than individual to whom it pertains. #####

For purposes of §§ 1301.11 to 1301.24, the parent of any minor or the legal guardian of any individual who has been declared incompetent due to physical or mental incapacity or age by a court of competent jurisdiction may act on behalf of the individual. TVA may require proof of the relationship prior to allowing such action. The parent or legal guardian may not act where the individual concerned objects to the action of the parent or legal guardian, unless a court otherwise orders.
