##### § 1301.76 Notice-and-comment procedures. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all proposed TVA guidance documents determined to be a “significant guidance document” shall be subject to the following informal notice-and-comment procedures. TVA shall publish a document in the Federal Register announcing that a draft of the proposed significant guidance document is publicly available, shall post the draft significant guidance document on the TVA guidance portal site, shall invite public comment on the draft document for at least 30 days, and shall prepare and post a public response to significant concerns raised in the comments, as appropriate, on the TVA guidance portal site, either before or when the guidance document is finalized and issued.

(b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section will not apply to any significant guidance document or categories of significant guidance documents for which OGC finds, in consultation with OIRA, and the vice president of the proposing TVA BU, good cause that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (and incorporates the finding of good cause and a brief statement of reasons therefor in the guidance issued).

(c) Where appropriate, OGC and the vice president of the proposing TVA BU may recommend to the TVA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) that a particular guidance document that is otherwise of importance to TVA's interests shall also be subject to the informal notice-and-comment procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section.
