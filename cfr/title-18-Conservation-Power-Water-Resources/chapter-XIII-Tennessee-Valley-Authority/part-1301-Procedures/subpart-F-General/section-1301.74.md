##### ยง 1301.74 Good faith cost estimates. #####

Even though not legally binding, some TVA guidance documents could result in significant economic impact. For example, guidance documents could induce private parties to alter their conduct to conform to recommended standards or practices, thereby incurring costs beyond the costs of complying with existing statutes and regulations. While it may be difficult to predict with precision the economic impact of guidance documents, the proposing TVA BU shall, to the extent practicable, make a good faith effort to estimate the likely economic cost impact of the guidance document to determine whether the document might meet the definition of a significant guidance document. When the proposing TVA BU is assessing or explaining whether it believes a guidance document is a significant guidance document, it shall comply with the analytic requirements that would otherwise be required for a major determination under the Congressional Review Act.
