##### ยง 1301.7 Exempt records. #####

(a) *Records available.* TVA's records will be made available for inspection and copying upon request as provided in this section, except that records are exempt and are not made available if they are:

(1)(i) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and

(ii) Are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;

(2) Related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of TVA;

(3) Specifically exempted from disclosure by statute;

(4) Trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from any person and privileged or confidential;

(5) Inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with TVA, including without limitation records relating to control and accounting for special nuclear material and to the physical security plans for the protection of TVA's nuclear facilities;

(6) Personnel and medical files and similar files, the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;

(7) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:

(i) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings,

(ii) Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication,

(iii) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,

(iv) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source,

(v) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or

(vi) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;

(8) Contained in or related to examination, operation, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of any agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institution; or

(9) Geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.

(b) The availability of certain classes of nonexempt records is deferred for such time as TVA may determine is reasonably necessary to avoid interference with the accomplishment of its statutory responsibilities. Such records include bids and information concerning the identity and number of bids received prior to bid opening; all nonexempt records relating to bids between the time of bid opening and award; and all nonexempt records relating to negotiations in progress involving contracts or agreements for the acquisition or disposal of real or personal property by TVA prior to the conclusion of such negotiations. Any reasonably segregable portion of an available record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this paragraph.
