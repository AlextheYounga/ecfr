Buy American Act Supply Contracts

(a) In TVA's acquisition of end products, the Buy American Act (41 U.S.C. 10a-10d) provides that preference be given to domestic end products. A domestic end product means:

(1) An unmanufactured end product which has been mined or produced in the United States; and

(2) An end product manufactured in the United States if the cost of components thereof which are mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components.

(b) Contractor agrees that there will be delivered under this contract only domestic end products, except end products:

(1) Which are for use outside the United States;

(2) Which TVA determines are not mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities and of a satisfactory quality;

(3) As to which TVA determines the domestic preference to be inconsistent with the public interest; or

(4) As to which TVA determines the cost to be unreasonable.
