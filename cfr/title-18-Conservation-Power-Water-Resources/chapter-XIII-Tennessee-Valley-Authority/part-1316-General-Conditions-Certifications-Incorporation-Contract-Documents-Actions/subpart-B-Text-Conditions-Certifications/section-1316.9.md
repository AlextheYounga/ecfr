##### § 1316.9 Nuclear energy hazards and nuclear incidents. #####

When so indicated in TVA contract documents or actions, the following clause is included by reference in such documents or actions:

Nuclear Energy Hazards and Nuclear Incidents

(Applicable only to contracts for goods or services delivered to nuclear plants.)

(a) Prior to, or at the time of shipment of the first nuclear fuel to the TVA nuclear facility, TVA will furnish nuclear liability protection in accordance with Section 170 of the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2210) and applicable regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Should this system of protection be repealed or changed, TVA would undertake to maintain in effect during the period of operation of the plant, to the extent available on reasonable terms, liability protection which would not result in a material impairment of the protection afforded to Contractor and its suppliers under existing system.

(b) TVA waives any claim it might have against Contractor or its subcontractors because of damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any property at the site of the TVA nuclear facility resulting from nuclear energy hazards or nuclear incidents. This provision shall not affect Contractor's obligation under the “Warranty” provision of this contract.

(c) TVA will indemnify Contractor and its subcontractors and save them harmless from any claims, losses, or liability arising as a result of damage to, loss of, or loss of use of any property at the site of the TVA nuclear facility resulting from nuclear energy hazards or nuclear incidents. In return for this indemnification, Contractor waives any claim it might have against any third party because of damage to, loss of, or loss of use of its property at the site of the TVA nuclear facility resulting from nuclear energy hazards or nuclear incidents.

(d) The foregoing waiver and indemnification provisions will apply to the full extent permitted by law and regardless of fault. The subcontractors referred to above include any of Contractor's suppliers of material, equipment, or services for the work, regardless of tier.

(e) For purposes of these provisions, the following definitions shall apply: Nuclear energy hazards shall mean the hazardous properties of nuclear material. Hazardous properties shall include radioactive, toxic, or explosive properties of nuclear material. Nuclear material shall include source material, special nuclear material or by-product material as those are defined in the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2014). Nuclear incident shall have the meaning given that term in the Atomic Energy Act (42 U.S.C. 2014(q)).
