##### § 1316.5 Clean Air and Water Acts. #####

When so indicated in TVA contract documents or actions, the following clause is included by reference in such documents or actions:

Clean Air and Water Acts

(a) If performance of this contract would involve the use of facilities which have given rise to a conviction under section 113(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7413) or section 309(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1319), offeror shall include in its offer a statement clearly setting forth the facts and circumstances of said conviction and shall list the facilities which gave rise to said conviction. If no such statement is submitted, submission of an offer constitutes certification by the offeror that performance of this contract will not involve the use of facilities which have given rise to a conviction under section 113(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act or section 309(c) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. As used in this clause “facilities” shall have the meaning set forth in 40 CFR 15.4.

(b) TVA will not award a contract to any offeror whose performance would involve the use of any facility or facilities which have given rise to a conviction as set forth in paragraph (a) of this clause except to the extent TVA, in its sole judgment, determines that such contract is exempt at the time of contract award from the provisions of 40 CFR part 15 as set forth therein.

(c) A condition of award of this contract is that contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the receipt of any communication from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicating that a facility to be utilized for this contract is under consideration to be listed on the EPA List of Violating Facilities. Prompt notification shall be required prior to contract award.
