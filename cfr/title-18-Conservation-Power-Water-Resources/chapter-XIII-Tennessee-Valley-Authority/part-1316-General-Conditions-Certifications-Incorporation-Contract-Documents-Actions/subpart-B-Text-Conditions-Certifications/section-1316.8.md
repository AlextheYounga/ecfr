##### § 1316.8 Employee protected activities. #####

When so indicated in TVA contract documents or actions, the following clause is included by reference in such documents or actions:

Employee Protected Activities

(Applicable to contracts for goods or services delivered to nuclear facilities or otherwise relating to Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensed activities.)

(a) Contractor shall comply with Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5851), as amended, which prohibits discrimination against employees for engaging in certain protected activities. The Secretary of Labor has determined that “discrimination” means discharge or any other adverse actions that relate to compensation, terms, conditions, and privileges of employment; the term “protected activities” includes, among other things, employees raising nuclear safety or quality controls complaints either internally to their employer or to the NRC. Contractor shall aggressively pursue any employee allegation of discrimination and shall fully investigate such allegations. Contractor shall notify the TVA Concerns Resolution Staff Site Representative of such allegation or complaint in writing, together with a copy of any complaint. Contractor shall provide TVA any investigative reports that it may prepare and shall also provide to TVA a full written description of any management action taken in response to any such allegation or complaint. In circumstances where any such allegation or complaint also charges TVA employees with involvement in any discriminatory activities, contractor shall cooperate fully with TVA counsel in its representation.

(b) Contractor shall ensure that no agreement affecting compensation, terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, including, but not limited to, any agreement to settle a complaint filed by an employee or former employee of the Contractor with the Department of Labor pursuant to Section 211 of the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended, may contain any provision which would prohibit, restrict, or otherwise discourage an employee or former employee from participating in any protected activity as described in the “Employee Protection” regulations of NRC, 10 CFR 50.7, including, but not limited to, providing information to NRC on potential violations of the NRC's regulations or other matters within NRC's regulatory responsibilities.

(c) Any breach of this provision shall be a material breach of the contract. In the event NRC imposes a civil penalty against TVA as a result of a breach of this provision, such a civil penalty is considered by the parties to be direct and not special or consequential damages.

(d) Contractor agrees to place this provision, along with the flow-down requirement of this sentence, in all subcontracts of any tier entered into pursuant to this contract.
