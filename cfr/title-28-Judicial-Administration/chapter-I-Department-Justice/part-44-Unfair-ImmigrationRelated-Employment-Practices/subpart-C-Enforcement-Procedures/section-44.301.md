(b) The notice to the charging party shall specify the date on which the charge was received, state that the charging party, other than an officer of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, may file a complaint before an administrative law judge if the Special Counsel does not do so within 120 days of receipt of the charge, and state the last date on which such a complaint may be filed.

(c)(1) Subject to paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if a charging party's submission is inadequate to constitute a charge as defined in § 44.101(a), the Special Counsel shall notify the charging party that specified additional information is needed.

(2) In the Special Counsel's discretion, the Special Counsel may deem a submission to be a filed charge as of the date of its receipt even though it is inadequate to constitute a charge as defined in § 44.101(a).

(d)(1) If the Special Counsel receives a charge after 180 days of the alleged occurrence of an unfair immigration-related employment practice, the Special Counsel shall dismiss the charge with prejudice.

(ii) Any additional information requested by the Special Counsel pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section is provided in writing to the Special Counsel within the 180-day period or within 45 days of the date on which the charging party received the Special Counsel's notification pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, whichever is later.

(e) The Special Counsel shall serve notice of the charge on the respondent by certified mail within 10 days of receipt of the charge. The notice shall include the date, place, and circumstances of the alleged unfair immigration-related employment practice.
