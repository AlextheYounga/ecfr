##### ยง 50.28 Prohibition on settlement payments to non-governmental third parties. #####

(a) The goals of a settlement agreement between the Department of Justice and a private party are to compensate victims, redress harm, or punish and deter unlawful conduct. It is generally not appropriate to use a settlement agreement to require, as a condition of settlement, payment to non-governmental, third-party organizations who are not victims or parties to the lawsuit.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, Department attorneys shall not enter into any agreement on behalf of the United States in settlement of federal claims or charges, including agreements settling civil litigation, accepting plea agreements, or deferring or declining prosecution in a criminal matter, that directs or provides for a payment or loan, in cash or in kind, to any non-governmental person or entity that is not a party to the dispute.

(c) Department attorneys may only enter into such agreements in four specific situations:

(1) When the otherwise lawful payment or loan, in cash or in kind, provides restitution or compensation to a victim, though in no case shall any such agreements require defendants in environmental cases, in lieu of payment to the Federal Government, to expend funds to provide goods or services to third parties for Supplemental Environmental Projects;

(2) When, in cases of foreign official corruption, a trusted third party is required to facilitate the repatriation and use of funds to directly benefit those harmed by the foreign corruption;

(3) When payment is for legal or other professional services rendered in connection with the case; or

(4) When payment is expressly authorized by statute or regulation, including restitution and forfeiture.

(d) This policy applies to all civil and criminal cases litigated under the direction of the Attorney General and includes civil settlement agreements, *cy pres* agreements or provisions, plea agreements, non-prosecution agreements, and deferred prosecution agreements.
