\*\* Adjusted penalty capped at 2.5 times the penalty amount in effect on November 2, 2015, the date of enactment of the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act Improvements Act of 2015, Public Law 114-74, sec. 701 (“2015 Amendments”). See id. § 701(b)(2) (amending section 5(b)(2)(C) of the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (28 U.S.C. 2461 note) to provide that the amount of the first inflation adjustment after the date of enactment of the 2015 Amendments “shall not exceed 150 percent of the amount of that civil monetary penalty on the date of enactment of the [2015 Amendments].”).

<sup>1</sup> The figures set forth in this column represent the penalty as last adjusted by Department of Justice regulation or statute as of November 2, 2015.

<sup>2</sup> All figures set forth in this table are maximum penalties, unless otherwise indicated.

<sup>3</sup> Section 3729(a)(1) of Title 31 states that any person who violates this section “is liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000, as adjusted by the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, plus 3 times the amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the act of that person.” 31 U.S.C. 3729(a)(1) (2012) (citation omitted). Section 3729(a)(2) permits the court to reduce the damages under certain circumstances to “not less than 2 times the amount of damages which the Government sustains because of the act of that person.” Id. § 3729(a)(2). The adjustment made by this regulation is only applicable to the specific statutory penalty amounts stated in subsection (a)(1), which is only one component of the civil penalty imposed under section 3729(a)(1).

<sup>4</sup> Section 8706(a)(1) of Title 41 states that “[t]he Federal Government in a civil action may recover from a person - (1) that knowingly engages in conduct prohibited by section 8702 of this title a civil penalty equal to - (A) twice the amount of each kickback involved in the violation; and (B) not more than $10,000 for each occurrence of prohibited conduct . . . .” 41 U.S.C. 8706(a)(1) (2012). The adjustment made by this regulation is only applicable to the specific statutory penalty amount stated in subsection (a)(1)(B), which is only one component of the civil penalty imposed under section 8706.

<sup>5</sup> Section 216(b) of Title 18 states the civil penalty should be no “more than $50,000 for each violation or the amount of compensation which the person received or offered for the prohibited conduct, whichever amount is greater.” 18 U.S.C. 216(b) (2012). Therefore, the adjustment made by this regulation is only applicable to the specific statutory penalty amount stated in subsection (b), which is only one aspect of the possible civil penalty imposed under § 216(b).

<sup>6</sup> Section 2105(b) of Title 41 states, “(b) Civil penalties. - The Attorney General may bring a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States against a person that engages in conduct that violates section 2102, 2103, or 2104 of this title. On proof of that conduct by a preponderance of the evidence - (1) an individual is liable to the Federal Government for a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 for each violation plus twice the amount of compensation that the individual received or offered for the prohibited conduct; and (2) an organization is liable to the Federal Government for a civil penalty of not more than $500,000 for each violation plus twice the amount of compensation that the organization received or offered for the prohibited conduct.” 41 U.S.C. 2105(b) (2012). The adjustments made by this regulation are only applicable to the specific statutory penalty amounts stated in subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), which are each only one component of the civil penalties imposed under sections 2105(b)(1) and (b)(2).

<sup>7</sup> The Attorney General has authority to bring a civil action when a person has violated or is about to violate a provision under this statute. 42 U.S.C. 5157(b) (2012)). The Federal Emergency Management Agency has promulgated regulations regarding this statute and has adjusted the penalty in its regulation. 44 CFR 206.14(d) (2015). The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has also promulgated a regulation regarding the penalty under this statute. 42 CFR 38.8 (2015).

<sup>8</sup> Section 1956(b)(1) of Title 18 states that “[w]hoever conducts or attempts to conduct a transaction described in subsection (a)(1) or (a)(3), or section 1957, or a transportation, transmission, or transfer described in subsection (a)(2), is liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than the greater of - (A) the value of the property, funds, or monetary instruments involved in the transaction; or (B) $10,000.” 18 U.S.C. 1956(b)(1) (2012). The adjustment made by this regulation is only applicable to the specific statutory penalty amount stated in subsection (b)(1)(B), which is only one aspect of the possible civil penalty imposed under section 1956(b).

<sup>9</sup> Section 842(c)(2)(C) of Title 21 states that “[i]n addition to the penalties set forth elsewhere in this subchapter or subchapter II of this chapter, any business that violates paragraph (11) of subsection (a) of this section shall, with respect to the first such violation, be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $250,000, but shall not be subject to criminal penalties under this section, and shall, for any succeeding violation, be subject to a civil fine of not more than $250,000 or double the last previously imposed penalty, whichever is greater.” 21 U.S.C. 842(c)(2)(C) (2012). The adjustment made by this regulation regarding the penalty for a succeeding violation is only applicable to the specific statutory penalty amount stated in subsection (c)(2)(C), which is only one aspect of the possible civil penalty for a succeeding violation imposed under section 842(c)(2)(C).

<sup>10</sup> Section 856(d)(1) of Title 21 states that “(1) Any person who violates subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than the greater of - (A) $250,000; or (B) 2 times the gross receipts, either known or estimated, that were derived from each violation that is attributable to the person.” 21 U.S.C. 856(d)(1) (2012). The adjustment made by this regulation is only applicable to the specific statutory penalty amount stated in subsection (d)(1)(A), which is only one aspect of the possible civil penalty imposed under section 856(d)(1).
