##### ยง 38.6 Procedures. #####

(a) *Effect on State and local funds.* If a State or local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement activities carried out under the applicable programs, the State or local government has the option to separate out the Federal funds or commingle them. If the funds are commingled, the provisions of this section shall apply to all of the commingled funds in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the provisions apply to the Federal funds.

(b) To the extent otherwise permitted by Federal law, the restrictions on explicitly religious activities set forth in this section do not apply to indirect Federal financial assistance.

(c) *Beneficiary protections: written notice.* (1) Faith-based or religious organizations providing social services to beneficiaries under a program supported by direct Federal financial assistance from the Department must give written notice to beneficiaries and prospective beneficiaries of certain protections. Such notice must be given in a manner prescribed by the Office for Civil Rights. This notice must state the following:

(i) The organization may not discriminate against beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries on the basis of religion, a religious belief, a refusal to hold a religious belief, or a refusal to attend or participate in a religious practice;

(ii) The organization may not require beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries to attend or participate in any explicitly religious activities that are offered by the organization, and any participation by beneficiaries in such activities must be purely voluntary;

(iii) The organization must separate in time or location any privately funded explicitly religious activities from activities supported by direct Federal financial assistance;

(iv) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary objects to the religious character of the organization, the organization will undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary has no objection; and

(v) Beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries may report an organization's violation of these protections, including any denials of services or benefits by an organization, by contacting or filing a written complaint with the Office for Civil Rights or the intermediary that awarded funds to the organization.

(2) This written notice must be given to prospective beneficiaries prior to the time they enroll in the program or receive services from the program. When the nature of the service provided or exigent circumstances make it impracticable to provide such written notice in advance of the actual service, organizations must advise beneficiaries of their protections at the earliest available opportunity.

(3) The notice that a faith-based or religious organization may use to notify beneficiaries or prospective beneficiaries of their protections under paragraph (g)(1) of this section is specified in appendix A to this part.

(d) *Beneficiary protections: referral requirements.* (1) If a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary of a social service program supported by direct Federal financial assistance from the Department objects to the religious character of an organization that provides services under the program, that organization must promptly undertake reasonable efforts to identify and refer the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to an alternative provider to which the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary has no objection based on the organization's religious character. See appendix B to this part.

(2) An organization may refer a beneficiary or prospective beneficiary to another faith-based or religious organization that provides comparable services, if the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary has no objection to that provider based on the organization's religious character. But if the beneficiary or prospective beneficiary requests a secular provider, and a secular provider is available, then a referral must be made to that provider.

(3) Except for services provided by telephone, Internet, or similar means, the referral must be to an alternative provider that is in reasonable geographic proximity to the organization making the referral and that offers services that are similar in substance and quality to those offered by the organization. The alternative provider also must have the capacity to accept additional clients.

(4) When the organization makes a referral to an alternative provider, the organization shall maintain a record of that referral for review by the awarding entity. When the organization determines that it is unable to identify an alternative provider, the organization shall promptly notify and maintain a record for review by the awarding entity. If the organization is unable to identify an alternative provider, the awarding entity shall determine whether there is any other suitable alternative provider to which the beneficiary may be referred. An intermediary that receives a request for assistance in identifying an alternative provider may request assistance from the Department.
