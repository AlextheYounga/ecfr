##### ยง 2.63 Quorum. #####

(a) Any Commission action authorized by law may be taken on a majority vote of the Commissioners holding office at the time the action is taken.

(b)(1) In the event of a tie vote of the Commission's membership on a matter, the matter that is the subject of the vote is not adopted by the Commission.

(2) If the matter that is the subject of the tie vote is the disposition of an offender's case, then the result of the tie vote is the offender's status quo ante, *i.e.,* no action is taken that is more favorable or more adverse regarding the offender. If in an earlier decision the Commission has given an offender a presumptive release date or a date for a 15-year reconsideration hearing, then the result of the tie vote is no change in the presumptive date or the date of the 15-year reconsideration hearing. If an offender is facing possible parole rescission or revocation, the result of the tie vote is the offender's retention of the parole effective date or the offender's return to supervision. *Exception:* If there is a tie vote in making one of the findings required by ยง 2.53 in a mandatory parole determination, the result of the tie vote is that the prisoner must be granted mandatory parole.

(3) The Commission may re-vote on a case disposition to resolve a tie vote or other impasse in satisfying a voting requirement of these rules.
