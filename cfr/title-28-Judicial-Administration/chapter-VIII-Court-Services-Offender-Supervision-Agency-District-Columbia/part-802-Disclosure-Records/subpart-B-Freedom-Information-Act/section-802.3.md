##### ยง 802.3 Guidelines for disclosure. #####

(a) The authority to release or deny access to records and information under the FOIA is limited to the General Counsel and his or her designee.

(b) An agency record will be released in response to a written request, unless a valid legal exemption to disclosure is asserted.

(1) Any applicable exemption to disclosure which is provided under the FOIA in 5 U.S.C. 552 may be asserted.

(2) A record must exist and be in the possession and control of the agency at the time of the request to be considered subject to this part and the FOIA. There is no obligation to create, compile, or obtain a record to satisfy a FOIA request.

(3) Hard copy of electronic records that are subject to FOIA requests under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3), and that are available to the public through an established distribution system or through the Federal Register or the Internet, normally need not be processed under the provisions of the FOIA. However, if the requester insists that the request be processed under the FOIA, then the request shall be processed under the FOIA.
