##### ยง 802.6 Documents from other agencies. #####

(a) *Documents from or relating to Federal agencies.* (1) When a request for records includes a document from another Federal agency, the document will be referred to the originating Federal agency for a determination of its releasability. The requester will be informed of the referral. This is not a denial of a FOIA request; thus no appeal rights accrue to the requester.

(2) When a FOIA request is received for a record created by the Agency that includes information originated by another federal agency, the record will be referred to the originating agency for review and recommendation on disclosure. The Agency will not release any such record without prior consultation with the originating agency.

(b) *Documents from non-Federal agencies.* When a request for records includes a document from a non-Federal agency, CSOSA staff must make a determination of its releasability.
