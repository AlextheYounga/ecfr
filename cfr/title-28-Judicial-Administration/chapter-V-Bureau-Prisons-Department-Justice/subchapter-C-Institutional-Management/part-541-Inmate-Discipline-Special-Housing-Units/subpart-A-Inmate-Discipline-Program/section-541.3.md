##### ยง 541.3 Prohibited acts and available sanctions. #####

(a) *Prohibited acts.* The list of prohibited acts are divided into four separate categories based on severity: Greatest; High; Moderate; and Low. We describe the prohibited acts in Table 1 - Prohibited Acts and Available Sanctions. Aiding, attempting, abetting, or making plans to commit any of the prohibited acts is treated the same as committing the act itself.

(b) *Available sanctions.* The list of available sanctions for committing prohibited acts is listed in Table 1 - Prohibited Acts and Available Sanctions. If you commit repetitive prohibited acts, we can impose increased sanctions, as listed in Table 2 - Additional Available Sanctions for Repeated Prohibited Acts Within the Same Severity Level.
