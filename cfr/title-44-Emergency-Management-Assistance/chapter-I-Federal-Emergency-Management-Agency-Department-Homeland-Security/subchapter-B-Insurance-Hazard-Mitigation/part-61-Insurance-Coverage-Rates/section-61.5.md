##### ยง 61.5 Special terms and conditions. #####

(a) No new flood insurance or renewal of flood insurance policies shall be written for properties declared by a duly constituted State or local zoning or other authority to be in violation of any flood plain, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood-related erosion area management or control law, regulation, or ordinance.

(b) In order to reduce the administrative costs of the Program, of which the Federal Government pays a major share, payment of the full policyholder premium must be made at the time of application.

(c) Because of the seasonal nature of flooding, refunds of premiums upon cancellation of coverage by the insured are permitted only if the insurer ceases to have an ownership interest in the covered property at the location described in the policy. Refunds of premiums for any other reason are subject to the conditions set forth in ยง 62.5 of this subchapter.
