##### ยง 64.3 Flood Insurance Maps. #####

(a) The following maps may be prepared by the Federal Insurance Administrator for use in connection with the sale of flood insurance:

(1) Flood Insurance Rate Map: This map is prepared after the flood hazard study for the community has been completed and the risk premium rates have been established. The FIRM indicates the risk premium rate zones applicable in the community and when those rates are effective. The FIRM also may indicate, at the request of the community, zones to identify areas of future-conditions flood hazards. The symbols used to designate the risk premium rate zones and future-conditions zones are as follows:
