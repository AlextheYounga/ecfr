##### ยง 79.9 Grant administration. #####

(a) The Grantee must follow FEMA grant requirements, including submission of performance and financial status reports, and shall follow adequate competitive procurement procedures. In addition, grantees are responsible for ensuring that all subgrantees are aware of and follow the requirements contained in 2 CFR parts 200 and 3002.

(b) During the implementation of an approved grant, the State POC may find that actual costs are exceeding the approved award amount. While there is no guarantee of additional funding, FEMA will only consider requests made by the State POC to pay for such overruns if:

(1) Funds are available to meet the requested increase in funding;

(2) The amended grant award meets the cost-share requirements identified in this section; and

(3) The total amount obligated to the State does not exceed the maximum funding amounts set in ยง 79.4(a)(2).

(c) Grantees may use cost underruns from ongoing subgrants to offset overruns incurred by another subgrant(s) awarded under the same grant. All costs for which funding is requested must have been included in the original application's cost estimate.

(d) For all cost overruns that exceed the amount approved under the grant, and which require additional Federal funds, the State POC shall submit a written request with a recommendation, including a justification for the additional funding to the Regional Administrator for a determination. If approved, the Regional Administrator shall increase the grant through an amendment to the original award document.

(e) At the time of closeout, FEMA will recapture any funds provided to a State or a community under these programs if the applicant has not provided the appropriate matching funds, the approved project has not been completed within the timeframes specified in the grant agreement, or the completed project does not meet the criteria specified in this part.
