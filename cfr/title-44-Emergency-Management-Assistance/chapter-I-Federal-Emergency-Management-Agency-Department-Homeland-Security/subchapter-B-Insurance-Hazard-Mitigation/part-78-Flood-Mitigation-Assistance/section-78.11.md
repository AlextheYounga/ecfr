##### ยง 78.11 Minimum project eligibility criteria. #####

The identification of a project or activity in an approved Flood Mitigation Plan does not mean it meets FMA eligibility criteria. Projects must:

(a) Be cost-effective, not costing more than the anticipated value of the reduction in both direct damages and subsequent negative impacts to the area if future floods were to occur. Both costs and benefits are computed on a net present value basis.

(b) Be in conformance with 44 CFR part 9, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands; Executive Order 12699, Seismic Safety of Federal and Federally Assisted or Regulated New Building Construction; and any applicable environmental laws and regulations.

(c) Be technically feasible.

(d) Be in conformance with the minimum standards of the NFIP Floodplain Management Regulations at 44 CFR part 60.

(e) Be in conformance with the Flood Mitigation Plan; the type of project being proposed must be identified in the plan.

(f) Be located physically in a participating NFIP community that is not on probation or must benefit such community directly by reducing future flood damages.
