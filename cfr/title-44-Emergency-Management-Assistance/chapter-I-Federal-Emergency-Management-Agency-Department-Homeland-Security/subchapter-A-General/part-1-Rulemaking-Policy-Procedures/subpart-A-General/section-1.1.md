##### § 1.1 Purpose. #####

(a) This part contains the basic policies and procedures of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for adoption of rules. These policies and procedures incorporate those provisions of section 4 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553) which FEMA will follow. This part and internal FEMA Manuals implement Executive Order 12291.

(b) Rules which must be published are described in section 3(a) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. 552(a). FEMA implementation of paragraph (a) is contained in 44 CFR part 5, subpart B.

(c) This part contains policies and procedures for implementation of the Regulatory Flexibility Act which took effect January 1, 1981.

(d) A FEMA Manual No. 1140.1, “The Formulation, Drafting, Clearance, and Publication of Federal Register Documents” has been issued describing the internal procedures including policy level oversight of FEMA for:

(1) Publishing the semiannual agenda of significant regulations under development and review;

(2) Making initial determinations with respect to significance of proposed rulemaking;

(3) Determining the need for regulatory analyses; and

(4) Reviewing existing regulations, including the reviews required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

(e) As the FEMA Manual deals with internal management it is not subject to the requirements either of 5 U.S.C. 552 or 553. Its provisions are not part of this rule and reference to it is informative only.
