##### § 1.9 Regulatory impact analyses. #####

(a) FEMA shall, in connection with any major rule, prepare and consider a Regulatory Impact Analysis. Such analysis may be combined with the Regulatory Flexibility Analysis described in §§ 1.12(f) and 1.16(c) of this part.

(b) FEMA shall initially determine whether a rule it intends to propose or to issue is a major rule and, if a major rule, shall prepare Regulatory Impact Analyses and transmit them, along with all notices of proposed rulemaking and all final rules, to the Director, Office of Management and Budget, as follows:

(1) If no notice of proposed rulemaking is to be published for a proposed major rule that is not an emergency rule, the agency shall prepare only a final Regulatory Impact Analysis, which shall be transmitted, along with the proposed rule, to the Director, Office of Management and Budget, at least 60 days prior to the publication of the major rule as a final rule;

(2) With respect to all other major rules, FEMA shall prepare a preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis, which shall be transmitted, along with a notice of proposed rulemaking, to the Director, Office of Management and Budget, at least 60 days prior to the publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, and a final Regulatory Impact Analysis, which shall be transmitted along with the final rule at least 30 days prior to the publication of the major rule as a final rule;

(3) For all rules other than major rules, FEMA shall, unless an exemption has been granted, submit to the Director, Office of Management and Budget, at least 10 days prior to publication, every notice of proposed rulemaking and final rule.

(c) To permit each major rule to be analyzed in light of the requirements stated in section 2 of Executive Order 12291, each preliminary and final Regulatory Impact Analysis shall contain the following information:

(1) A description of the potential benefits of the rule, including any beneficial effects that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to receive the benefits;

(2) A description of the potential costs of the rule, including any adverse effects that cannot be quantified in monetary terms, and the identification of those likely to bear the costs;

(3) A determination of the potential net benefits of the rule, including an evaluation of effects that cannot be quantified in monetary terms;

(4) A description of alternative approaches that could substantially achieve the same regulatory goal at lower cost, together with an analysis of this potential benefit and costs and a brief explanation of the legal reasons why such alternatives, if proposed, could not be adopted; and

(5) Unless covered by the description required under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, an explanation of any legal reasons why the rule cannot be based on the requirements set forth in section 2 of Executive Order 12291.
