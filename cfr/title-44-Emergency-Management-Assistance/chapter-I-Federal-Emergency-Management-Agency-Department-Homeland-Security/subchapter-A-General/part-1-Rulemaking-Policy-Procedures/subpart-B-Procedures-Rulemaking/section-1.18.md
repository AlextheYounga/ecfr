##### ยง 1.18 Petition for rulemaking. #####

(a) Any interested person may petition the Administrator for the issuance, amendment, or repeal of a rule. For purposes of this section the term *person* includes a Federal, State or local government or government agency. Each petition shall:

(1) Be submitted to the Rules Docket Clerk;

(2) Set forth the substance of the rule or amendment proposed or specify the rule sought to be repealed or amended;

(3) Explain the interest of the petitioner in support of the action sought; and

(4) Set forth all data and arguments available to the petitioner in support of the action sought.

(b) No public procedures will be held directly on the petition before its disposition. If the Administrator finds that the petition contains adequate justification, a rulemaking proceeding will be initiated or a final rule will be issued as appropriate. If the Administrator finds that the petition does not contain adequate justification, the petition will be denied by letter or other notice, with a brief statement of the ground for denial. The Administrator may consider new evidence at any time; however, repetitious petitions for rulemaking will not be considered.
