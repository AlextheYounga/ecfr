##### § 1.15 Hearings. #####

(a) The provisions of 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557, which govern formal hearings in adjudicatory proceedings, do not apply to informal rulemaking proceedings described in this part. When opportunity is afforded for oral presentation, the informal “hearing” is a nonadversary, fact-finding proceeding. Any rule issued in a proceeding under this part in which a hearing is held need not be based exclusively on the record of such hearing.

(b) When a hearing is provided, the Administrator will designate a representative to conduct the hearing.
