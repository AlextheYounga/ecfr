##### § 328.103 Designation of covered materials. #####

(a) The Administrator has designated the following materials as “covered materials” under this part:

(1) Surgical N95 Filtering Facepiece Respirators, including devices that are disposable half-face-piece non-powered air-purifying particulate respirators intended for use to cover the nose and mouth of the wearer to help reduce wearer exposure to pathogenic biological airborne particulates;

(2) PPE surgical masks as described by 21 CFR 878.4040, including masks that cover the user's nose and mouth providing a physical barrier to fluids and particulate materials, that meet fluid barrier protection standards pursuant to -

(i) ASTM F 1862; and

(ii) Class I or Class II flammability tests under CPSC CS 191-53, NFPA Standard 702-1980, or UL 2154 standards;

(3) PPE nitrile gloves, specifically those defined at 21 CFR 880.6250 (exam gloves) and 878.4460 (surgical gloves) and such nitrile gloves intended for the same purposes;

(4) Level 3 and 4 Surgical Gowns and Surgical Isolation Gowns that meet all of the requirements in ANSI/AAMI PB70 and ASTM F2407-06 and are classified by Surgical Gown Barrier Performance based on AAMI PB70; and

(5) Syringes and hypodermic needles (whether distributed separately or attached together) that are either:

(i) Piston syringes that allow for the controlled and precise flow of liquid as described by 21 CFR 880.5860, that are compliant with ISO 7886-1:2017 and use only Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) processes; or

(ii) Hypodermic single lumen needles that have engineered sharps injury protections as described in the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, Pub. L. 106-430, 114 Stat. 1901 (Nov. 6, 2000).

(b) Upon determination that additional items are scarce and necessary for national defense, and that consideration under the allocation order in this part is the only way to meet national defense requirements without significant disruption to the domestic markets, the Administrator may designate additional materials as “covered materials” in the list provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The Administrator will publish notice of these additional “covered materials” in the Federal Register.
