##### ยง 328.102 Requirements. #####

(a) *Allocation order and requirement for the Administrator's approval.* All shipments of covered materials, as designated in ยง 328.103, shall be allocated for domestic use, and may not be exported from the United States without explicit approval by FEMA.

(b) *Procedures.* U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in coordination with such other officials as may be appropriate, will notify FEMA of an intended export of covered materials. CBP must temporarily detain any shipment of such covered materials, pending the Administrator's determination whether to return for domestic use or issue a rated order for part or all of the shipment, pursuant to the Administrator's delegated authorities. The Administrator will make such a determination within a reasonable timeframe after notification of an intended export.

(c) *Administrator's determination.* In making the determination described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Administrator may consult other agencies and will consider the totality of the circumstances, including the following factors:

(1) The need to ensure that scarce or threatened items are appropriately allocated for domestic use;

(2) Minimization of disruption to the supply chain, both domestically and abroad;

(3) The circumstances surrounding the distribution of the materials and potential hoarding or price-gouging concerns;

(4) The quantity and quality of the materials;

(5) Humanitarian considerations; and

(6) International relations and diplomatic considerations.

(d) *Exemption.* (1) The Administrator has determined in the interest of promoting the national defense to generally allow the export of covered materials from shipments made by or on behalf of U.S. manufacturers with continuous export agreements with customers in other countries since at least January 1, 2020, so long as at least 80 percent of such manufacturer's domestic production of such covered materials, on a per item basis, was distributed in the United States in the preceding 12 months. If FEMA determines that a shipment of covered materials falls within the exemption in this paragraph (d), such materials may be exported without further review by FEMA, provided that the Administrator may waive the exemption in this paragraph (d) and fully review shipments of covered materials under paragraph (b) of this section, if the Administrator determines that doing so is necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense. FEMA will communicate to CBP regarding the application of the exemption in this paragraph (d) to shipments identified by CBP.

(2) The Administrator may establish, in his or her discretion, additional exemptions that he or she determines necessary or appropriate to promote the national defense and will announce any such exemptions by notice in the Federal Register.

(e) *Exportations prohibited.* The exportation of covered materials other than in accordance with this section is prohibited.
