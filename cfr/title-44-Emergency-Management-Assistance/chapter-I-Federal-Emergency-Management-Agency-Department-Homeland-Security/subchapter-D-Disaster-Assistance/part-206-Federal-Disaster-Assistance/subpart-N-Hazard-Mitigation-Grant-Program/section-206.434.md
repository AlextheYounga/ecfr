(a) *Applicants.* The following are eligible to apply for the Hazard Mitigation Program Grant:

(1) State and local governments;

(2) Private nonprofit organizations that own or operate a private nonprofit facility as defined in § 206.221(e). A qualified conservation organization as defined at § 80.3(h) of this chapter is the only private nonprofit organization eligible to apply for acquisition or relocation for open space projects;

(3) Indian tribes or authorized tribal organizations and Alaska Native villages or organizations, but not Alaska native corporations with ownership vested in private individuals.

(b) *Plan requirement.* (1) Local and Indian Tribal government applicants for project subgrants must have an approved local or Tribal Mitigation Plan in accordance with 44 CFR part 201 before receipt of HMGP subgrant funding for projects.

(2) Regional Administrators may grant an exception to this requirement in extraordinary circumstances, such as in a small and impoverished community when justification is provided. In these cases, a plan will be completed within 12 months of the award of the project grant. If a plan is not provided within this timeframe, the project grant will be terminated, and any costs incurred after notice of grant's termination will not be reimbursed by FEMA.

(c) *Minimum project criteria.* To be eligible for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, a project must:

(1) Be in conformance with the State Mitigation Plan and Local or Tribal Mitigation Plan approved under 44 CFR part 201; or for Indian Tribal governments acting as grantees, be in conformance with the Tribal Mitigation Plan approved under 44 CFR 201.7;

(2) Have a beneficial impact upon the designated disaster area, whether or not located in the designated area;

(3) Be in conformance with 44 CFR part 9, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, and other applicable environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, Executive Orders, and agency policy;

(4) Solve a problem independently or constitute a functional portion of a solution where there is assurance that the project as a whole will be completed. Projects that merely identify or analyze hazards or problems are not eligible;

(5) Be cost-effective and substantially reduce the risk of future damage, hardship, loss, or suffering resulting from a major disaster. The grantee must demonstrate this by documenting that the project;

(i) Addresses a problem that has been repetitive, or a problem that poses a significant risk to public health and safety if left unsolved,

(ii) Will not cost more than the anticipated value of the reduction in both direct damages and subsequent negative impacts to the area if future disasters were to occur,

(iii) Has been determined to be the most practical, effective, and environmentally sound alternative after consideration of a range of options,

(iv) Contributes, to the extent practicable, to a long-term solution to the problem it is intended to address,

(v) Considers long-term changes to the areas and entities it protects, and has manageable future maintenance and modification requirements.

(d) *Eligible activities* - (1) *Planning.* Up to 7% of the State's HMGP grant may be used to develop State, tribal and/or local mitigation plans to meet the planning criteria outlined in 44 CFR part 201.

(2) *Types of projects.* Projects may be of any nature that will result in protection to public or private property. Activities for which implementation has already been initiated or completed are not eligible for funding. Eligible projects include, but are not limited to:

(i) Structural hazard control or protection projects;

(ii) Construction activities that will result in protection from hazards;

(iii) Retrofitting of facilities;

(iv) Property acquisition or relocation, as defined in paragraph (e) of this section;

(v) Development of State or local mitigation standards;

(vi) Development of comprehensive mitigation programs with implementation as an essential component;

(vii) Development or improvement of warning systems.

(e) *Property acquisitions and relocation requirements.* Property acquisitions and relocation projects for open space proposed for funding pursuant to a major disaster declared on or after December 3, 2007 must be implemented in accordance with part 80 of this chapter. For major disasters declared before December 3, 2007, a project involving property acquisition or the relocation of structures and individuals is eligible for assistance only if the applicant enters into an agreement with the FEMA Regional Administrator that provides assurances that:

(1) The following restrictive covenants shall be conveyed in the deed to any property acquired, accepted, or from which structures are removed (hereafter called in section (d) the property):

(i) The property shall be dedicated and maintained in perpetuity for uses compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management practices; and

(ii) No new structure(s) will be built on the property except as indicated below:

(A) A public facility that is open on all sides and functionally related to a designated open space or recreational use;

(B) A rest room; or

(C) A structure that is compatible with open space, recreational, or wetlands management usage and proper floodplain management policies and practices, which the Administrator approves in writing before the construction of the structure begins.

(iii) After completion of the project, no application for additional disaster assistance will be made for any purpose with respect to the property to any Federal entity or source, and no Federal entity or source will provide such assistance.

(2) In general, allowable open space, recreational, and wetland management uses include parks for outdoor recreational activities, nature reserves, cultivation, grazing, camping (except where adequate warning time is not available to allow evacuation), temporary storage in the open of wheeled vehicles which are easily movable (except mobile homes), unimproved, previous parking lots, and buffer zones.

(3) Any structures built on the property according to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall be floodproofed or elevated to the Base Flood Elevation plus one foot of freeboard.

(f) *Duplication of programs.* Section 404 funds cannot be used as a substitute or replacement to fund projects or programs that are available under other Federal authorities, except under limited circumstances in which there are extraordinary threats to lives, public health or safety or improved property.

(g) *Packaging of programs.* Section 404 funds may be packaged or used in combination with other Federal, State, local, or private funding sources when appropriate to develop a comprehensive mitigation solution, though section 404 funds cannot be used as a match for other Federal funds.
