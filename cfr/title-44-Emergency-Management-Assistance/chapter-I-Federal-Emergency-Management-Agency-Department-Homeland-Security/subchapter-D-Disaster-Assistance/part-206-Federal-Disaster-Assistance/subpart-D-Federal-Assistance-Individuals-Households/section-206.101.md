##### § 206.101 Temporary housing assistance for emergencies and major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002. #####

Link to an amendment published at 89 FR 4118, Jan. 22, 2024.

(a) *Purpose.* This section prescribes the policy to be followed by the Federal Government or any other organization when implementing section 408 of the Stafford Act for Presidentially-declared emergencies and major disasters declared on or before October 14, 2002 (Note that the reference to section 408 of the Stafford Act refers to prior legislation amended by the Disaster Mitigation Act 2000).

(b) *Program intent.* Assistance under this program is made available to applicants who require temporary housing as a result of a major disaster or emergency that is declared by the President. Eligibility for assistance is based on need created by disaster-related unlivability of a primary residence or other disaster-related displacement, combined with a lack of adequate insurance coverage. Eligible applicants may be paid for authorized accommodations and/or repairs. In the interest of assisting the greatest number of people in the shortest possible time, applicants who are able to do so will be encouraged to make their own arrangements for temporary housing. Although numerous instances of minor damage may cause some inconvenience to the applicant, the determining eligibility factor must be the livability of the primary residence. FEMA has also determined that it is reasonable to expect applicants or their landlords to make some repairs of a minor nature. Temporary housing will normally consist of a check to cover housing-related costs wherever possible.

(c) *Definitions*—(1) *Adequate alternate housing* means housing that:

(i) Accommodates the needs of the occupants.

(ii) Is within reasonable commuting distance of work, school, or agricultural activities which provide over 25% of the household income.

(iii) Is within the financial ability of the occupant in the realization of a permanent housing plan.

(2) *Effective date of assistance* means the date the eligible applicant received temporary housing assistance but, where applicable, only after appropriate insurance benefits are exhausted.

(3) *Essential living area* means that area of the residence essential to normal living, i.e., kitchen, one bathroom, dining area, living room, entrances and exits, and essential sleeping areas. It does not include family rooms, guest rooms, garages, or other nonessential areas, unless hazards exist in these areas which impact the safety of the essential living area.

(4) *Fair market rent* means a reasonable amount to pay in the local area for the size and type of accommodations which meets the applicant's needs.

(5) *Financial ability* is the determination of the occupant's ability to pay housing costs. The determination is based upon the amount paid for housing before the disaster, provided the household income has not changed subsequent to or as a result of the disaster or 25 percent of gross post disaster income if the household income changed as a result of the disaster. When computing financial ability, extreme or unusual financial circumstances may be considered by the Regional Administrator.

(6) *Household* means all residents of the predisaster residence who request temporary housing assistance, plus any additions during the temporary housing period, such as infants, spouses, or part-time residents who were not present at the time of the disaster but who are expected to return during the temporary housing period.

(7) *Housing costs* means shelter rent and mortgage payments including principal, interest, real estate taxes, real property insurance, and utility costs, where appropriate.

(8) *Occupant* means an eligible applicant residing in temporary housing provided under this section.

(9) *Owner-occupied* means that the residence is occupied by: the legal owner; a person who does not hold formal title to the residence and pays no rent but is responsible for the payment of taxes, or maintenance of the residence; or a person who has lifetime occupancy rights with formal title vested in another.

(10) *Primary residence* means the dwelling where the applicant normally lives during the major portion of the calendar year, a dwelling which is required because of proximity to employment, or to agricultural activities as referenced in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.

(d) *Duplication of benefits*—(1) *Requirement to avoid duplication.* Temporary housing assistance shall not be provided to an applicant if such assistance has been provided by any other source. If any State or local government or voluntary agency has provided temporary housing, the assistance under this section begins at the expiration of such assistance, and may continue for a period not to exceed l8 months from the date of declaration, provided the criteria for continued assistance in paragraph (k)(3) of this section are met. If it is determined that temporary housing assistance will be provided under this section, notification shall be given those agencies which have the potential for duplicating such assistance. In the instance of insured applicants, temporary housing assistance shall be provided only when:

(i) Payment of the applicable benefits has been significantly delayed;

(ii) Applicable benefits have been exhausted;

(iii) Applicable benefits are insufficient to cover the temporary housing need; or

(iv) Housing is not available on the private market.

(2) *Recovery of funds.* Prior to provision of assistance, the applicant must agree to repay to FEMA from insurance proceeds or recoveries from any other source an amount equivalent to the value of the temporary housing assistance provided. In no event shall the amount repaid to FEMA exceed the amount recovered by the applicant. All claims shall be collected in accordance with agency procedures for debt collection.

(e) *Applications*—(1) *Application period.* The standard FEMA application period is the 60 days following the date the President declares an incident a major disaster or an emergency. The Regional Administrator may, however, extend the application period, when we anticipate that we need more time to collect applications from the affected population or to establish the same application deadline for contiguous Counties or States. After the application period has ended, FEMA will accept and process applications for an additional 60 days only from persons who can provide an acceptable explanation (and documentation to substantiate their explanation) for why they were not able to contact FEMA before the application period ended.

(2) *Household composition.* Members of a household shall be included on a single application and be provided one temporary housing residence unless it is determined by the Regional Administrator that the size of the household requires that more than one residence be provided.

(f) *General eligibility guidelines.* Temporary housing assistance may be made available to those applicants who, as a result of a major disaster or emergency declared by the President, are qualified for such assistance.

(1) *Conditions of eligibility.* Temporary housing assistance may be provided only when *both* of the following conditions are met:

(i) The applicant's primary residence has been made unlivable or the applicant has been displaced as the result of a major disaster or emergency because:

(A) The residence has been destroyed, essential utility service has been interrupted, or the essential living area has been damaged as a result of the disaster to such an extent as to constitute a serious health or safety hazard which did not exist prior to the disaster. The Regional Administrator shall prepare additional guidelines when necessary to respond to a particular disaster;

(B) The residence has been made inaccessible as a result of the incident to the extent that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to gain entry due to the disruption or destruction of transportation routes, other impediments to access, or restrictions placed on movement by a responsible official due to continued health and safety problems;

(C) The owner of the applicant's residence requires the residence to meet their personal needs because the owner's predisaster residence was made unlivable as a result of the disaster;

(D) Financial hardship resulting from the disaster has led to eviction or dispossession; or

(E) Other circumstances resulting from the disaster, as determined by the Regional Administrator, prevent the applicant from occupying their predisaster primary residence.

(ii) Insured applicants have made every reasonable effort to secure insurance benefits, and the insured has agreed to repay FEMA from whatever insurance proceeds are later received, pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

(2) *Conditions of ineligibility.* Except as provided for in section 408(b), Temporary Housing Assistance shall not be provided:

(i) To an applicant who is displaced from other than their primary residence; or

(ii) When the residence in question is livable, i.e., only minor damage exists and it can reasonably be expected to be repaired by the applicant/owner or the landlord; or

(iii) When the applicant owns a secondary or vacation residence, or unoccupied rental property which meets their temporary housing needs; or

(iv) To an applicant who has adequate rent-free housing accommodations; or

(v) To an applicant who has adequate insurance coverage and there is no indication that benefits will be delayed; or

(vi) When a late application is not approved for processing by the Regional Administrator; or

(vii) To an applicant who evacuated the residence in response to official warnings solely as a precautionary measure, and who is able to return to the residence immediately after the incident (i.e., the applicant is not otherwise eligible for temporary housing assistance).

(g) *Forms of Temporary Housing Assistance.* All proceeds received or receivable by the applicant under § 206.101 shall be exempt from garnishment, seizure, encumbrance, levy, execution, pledge, attachment, release, or waiver. No rights under this provision are assignable or transferable.

(1) Temporary Housing Assistance is normally provided in the form of a check to cover the cost of rent or essential home repairs. The exceptions to this are when existing rental resources are not available and repairs to the home will not make it livable in a reasonable period of time, or when the eligible applicant is unable to physically leave the home due to the need to tend crops or livestock.

(i) *Government-owned, private, and commercial properties.* When an eligible applicant is unable to obtain an available temporary housing unit, FEMA may enter into a leasing agreement for the eligible applicant. Rent payments shall be in accordance with the fair market rent (FMR) rates established for each operation for the type and size residence.

(ii) *Transient accommodations.* Immediately following a Presidentially declared major disaster or emergency, disaster victims are expected to stay with family or friends without FEMA assistance, or to make use of mass shelters to the fullest extent possible for short-term housing. Transient accommodations may be provided when individual circumstances warrant such assistance for only a short period of time or pending provision of other temporary housing resources. Transient accommodations may be provided for up to 30 days unless this period is extended by the Regional Administrator. Authorized expenditures for transient accommodations shall be restricted to the rental cost including utilities except for those which are separately metered. Payment for food, telephone, or other similar services is not authorized under this section.

(2) Mobile homes, travel trailers, and other manufactured housing units. Government-owned or privately owned mobile homes, travel trailers, and other manufactured housing units may be placed on commercial, private, or group sites. The placement must comply with applicable State and local codes and ordinances as well as FEMA'S regulations at 44 CFR part 9, Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands, and the regulations at 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations.

(i) A commercial site is a site customarily leased for a fee because it is fully equipped to accommodate a housing unit. In accordance with section 408(a)(2)(B), the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has determined that leasing commercial sites at Federal expense is in the public interest. When the Regional Administrator determines that upgrading of commercial sites or installation of utilities on such sites will provide more cost-effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources, they may authorize such action at Federal expense.

(ii) A private site is a site provided or obtained by the applicant at no cost to the Federal Government. Also in accordance with section 408(a)(2)(B), the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has determined that the cost of installation or repairs of essential utilities on private sites is authorized at Federal expense when such actions will provide more cost-effective, timely, and suitable temporary housing than other types of resources.

(iii) A group site is a site which accommodates two or more units. In accordance with section 408(a)(2)(A), locations for group sites shall be provided by State or local government complete with utilities. However, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may authorize development of group sites, including installation of essential utilities, by the Federal Government, based on a recommendation from the Regional Administrator; provided, however, that the Federal expense is limited to 75 percent of the cost of construction and development (including installation of utilities). In accordance with section 408(a)(4) of the Stafford Act, the State or local government shall pay any cost which is not paid for from the Federal share, including long-term site maintenance such as snow removal, street repairs and other services of a governmental nature.

(3) *Temporary mortgage and rental payments.* Assistance in the form of mortgage or rental payments may be paid to or be provided on behalf of eligible applicants who, as a result of a major disaster or emergency, have received written notice of dispossession or eviction from their primary residence by foreclosure of any mortgage or lien, cancellation of any contract of sale, or termination of any lease entered into prior to the disaster. Written notice, for the purpose of this paragraph, means a communication in writing by a landlord, mortgage holder, or other party authorized under State law to file such notice. The purpose of such notice is to notify a person of impending termination of a lease, foreclosure of a mortgage or lien, or cancellation of any contract of sale, which would result in the person's dispossession or eviction. Applications for this type of assistance may be filed for up to 6 months following the date of declaration. This assistance may be provided for a period not to exceed 18 months or for the duration of the period of financial hardship, as determined by the Regional Administrator, whichever is less. The location of the residence of an applicant for assistance under this section shall not be a consideration of eligibility.

(4) *Home repairs.* Repairs may be authorized to quickly repair or restore to a livable condition that portion of or areas affecting the essential living area of, or private access to, an owner-occupied primary residence which was damaged as a result of the disaster. Installation of utilities or conveniences not available in the residence prior to the disaster shall not be provided. However, repairs which are authorized shall conform to applicable local and/or State building codes; upgrading of existing damaged utilities may be authorized when required by these codes.

(i) *Options for repairs.* Eligible applicants approved for repairs may be assisted through one or a combination of the following methods:

(A) *Cash payment.* Payment shall be limited to the reasonable costs for the repairs and replacements in the locality, as determined by the Regional Administrator. This will be the method normally used, unless unusual circumstances warrant the methods listed under paragraph (g)(4), (i) (B) or (C) of this section.

(B) Provision of materials and replacement items.

(C) Government awarded repair contracts when authorized by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.

(ii) *Feasibility.* Repairs may be provided to those eligible applicants:

(A) Who are owner-occupants of the residence to be made livable;

(B) Whose residence can be made livable by repairs to the essential living area within 30 days following the feasibility determination. The Regional Administrator may extend this period for extenuating circumstances by determining that this type of assistance is still more cost effective, timely and otherwise suitable than other forms for temporary housing; and

(C) Whose residence can be made livable by repairs to the essential living area, the cost of which do not exceed the dollar limitations established by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The Regional Administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, waive the dollar limitations when repairs are more cost effective and appropriate than other forms of housing assistance or when extenuating circumstances warrant.

(iii) *Scope of work.* The type of repair or replacement authorized may vary depending upon the nature of the disaster. Items will be repaired where feasible or replaced only when necessary to insure the safety or health of the occupant. Replacement items shall be of average quality, size, and capacity taking into consideration the needs of the occupant. Repairs shall be disaster related and shall be limited to:

(A) Repairs to the plumbing system, including repairs to or replacement of fixtures, providing service to the kitchen and one bathroom;

(B) Repairs to the electrical system providing service to essential living areas, including repairs to or replacement of essential fixtures;

(C) Repairs to the heating unit, including repairs to duct work, vents, and integral fuel and electrical systems. If repair or replacement through other forms of assistance cannot be accomplished before the start of the season requiring heat, home repairs may be authorized by the Regional Administrator when an inspection shows that the unit has been damaged beyond repair, or when the availability of necessary parts or components makes repair impossible;

(D) Repairs to or replacement of essential components of the fuel system to provide for cooking;

(E) Pumping and cleaning of the septic system, repairs to or replacement of the tank, drainfield, or repairs to sewer lines;

(F) Flushing and/or purifying the water well, and repairs to or replacement of the pump, controls, tank, and pipes;

(G) Repairs to or replacement of exterior doors, repair of windows and/or screens needed for health purposes;

(H) Repairs to the roof, when the damages affect the essential living area;

(I) Repairs to interior floors, when severe buckling or deterioration creates a serious safety hazard;

(J) Blocking, leveling, and anchoring of a mobile home; and reconnecting and/or resetting mobile home sewer, water, electrical and fuel lines, and tanks;

(K) Emergency repairs to private access routes, limited to those repairs that meet the minimum safety standards and using the most economical materials available. Such repairs are provided on a one-time basis when no alternative access facilities are immediately available and when the repairs are more cost effective, timely or otherwise suitable than other forms of temporary housing.

(L) Repairs to the foundation piers, walls or footings when the damages affect the structural integrity of the essential living area;

(M) Repairs to the stove and refrigerator, when feasible; and

(N) Elimination of other health and safety hazards or performance of essential repairs which are authorized by the Regional Administrator as not available through emergency services provided by voluntary or community agencies, and cannot reasonably be expected to be completed on a timely basis by the occupant without FEMA assistance.

(iv) Requirements of the Flood Disaster Protection Act. FEMA has determined that flood insurance purchase requirements need not be imposed as a condition of receiving assistance under paragraph (g)(4) of this section. Repair recipients will normally receive assistance for further repairs from other programs which will impose the purchase and maintenance requirements. Home repairs may not be provided in Zones A or V of a sanctioned or suspended community except for items that are not covered by flood insurance.

(h) *Appropriate form of temporary housing.* The form of temporary housing provided should not exceed occupants' minimum requirements, taking into consideration items such as timely availability, cost effectiveness, permanent housing plans, special needs (handicaps, the location of crops and livestock, etc.) of the occupants, and the requirements of FEMA'S floodplain management regulations at 44 CFR part 9. An eligible applicant shall receive one form of temporary housing, except for transient accommodations or when provision of an additional form is in the best interest of the Government. An eligible applicant is expected to accept the first offer of temporary housing; unwarranted refusal shall result in forfeiture of temporary housing assistance. Existing rental resources and home repairs shall be utilized to the fullest extent practicable prior to provision of government-owned mobile homes.

(i) *Utility costs and security deposits.* All utility costs shall be the responsibility of the occupant except where utility services are not metered separately and are therefore a part of the rental charge. Utility use charges and deposits shall always be the occupants responsibility. When authorized by the Regional Administrator, the Federal Government may pay security deposits; however, the owner or occupant shall reimburse the full amount of the security deposit to the Federal Government before or at the time that the temporary housing assistance is terminated.

(j) *Furniture.* An allowance for essential furniture may be provided to occupants when such assistance is required to occupy the primary or temporary housing residence. However, loss of furniture does not in and of itself constitute eligibility for temporary housing assistance. Luxury items shall not be provided.

(k) *Duration of assistance*—(1) *Commencement.* Temporary housing assistance may be provided as of the date of the incident of the major disaster or emergency as specified in the Federal Register notice and may continue for 18 months from the date of declaration. An effective date of assistance shall be established for each applicant.

(2) *Continued assistance.* Predisaster renters normally shall be provided no more than 1 month of assistance unless the Regional Administrator determines that continued assistance is warranted in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section. All other occupants of temporary housing shall be certified eligible for continued assistance in increments not to exceed 3 months. Recertification of eligibility for continued assistance shall be in accordance with paragraph (k)(3) of this section, taking into consideration the occupant's permanent housing plan. A realistic permanent housing plan shall be established for each occupant requesting additional assistance no later than at the time of the first recertification.

(3) *Criteria for continued assistance.* A temporary housing occupant shall make every effort to obtain and occupy permanent housing at the earliest possible time. A temporary housing occupant will be required to provide receipts documenting disaster related housing costs and shall be eligible for continued assistance when:

(i) Adequate alternate housing is not available;

(ii) The permanent housing plan has not been realized through no fault of the occupant; or

(iii) In the case of FEMA-owner leases, the occupant is in compliance with the terms of the lease/rental agreement.

(l) *Period of assistance.* Provided the occupant is eligible for continued assistance, assistance shall be provided for a period not to exceed 18 months from the declaration date.

(m) *Appeals.* Occupants shall have the right to appeal a program determination in accordance with the following:

(1) An applicant declared ineligible for temporary housing assistance, an applicant whose application has been cancelled for cause, an applicant whose application has been refused because of late filing, and an occupant who received a direct housing payment but is not eligible for continued assistance in accordance with paragraph (k) of this section, shall have the right to dispute such a determination within 60 calendar days following notification of such action. The Regional Administrator shall reconsider the original decision within 15 calendar days after its receipt. The appellant shall be given a written notice of the disposition of the dispute. The decision of the Regional Administrator is final.

(2) An occupant who has been notified that his/her request to purchase a mobile home or manufactured housing unit or that a request for an adjustment to the sales price has been denied shall have the right to dispute such a determination within 60 business days after receipt of such notice. The Regional Administrator shall reconsider the original decision within 15 calendar days after receipt of the appeal. The appellant shall receive written notice of the disposition of the dispute. The decision of the Regional Administrator is final.

(3) Termination of assistance provided through a FEMA lease agreement shall be initiated with a 15-day written notice after which the occupant shall be liable for such additional charges as are deemed appropriate by the Regional Administrator including, but not limited to, the fair market rental for the temporary housing residence.

(i) *Grounds for termination.* Temporary housing assistance may be terminated for reasons including, but not limited to the following:

(A) Adequate alternate housing is available to the occupant(s);

(B) The temporary housing assistance was obtained either through misrepresentation or fraud; or

(C) Failure to comply with any term of the lease/rental agreement.

(ii) *Termination procedures.* These procedures shall be utilized in all instances except when a State is administering the Temporary Housing Assistance program. States shall be subject to their own procedures provided they afford the occupant(s) with due process safeguards described in paragraph (m)(2)(v)(B) of this section.

(A) *Notification to occupant.* Written notice shall be given by FEMA to the occupant(s) at least 15 days prior to the proposed termination of assistance. This notice shall specify: the reasons for termination of assistance/occupancy; the date of termination, which shall be not less than 15 days after receipt of the notice; the administrative procedure available to the occupant if they wish to dispute the action; and the occupant's liability after the termination date for additional charges.

(B) *Filing of appeal.* If the occupant desires to dispute the termination, upon receipt of the written notice specified in paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section, he/she shall present an appeal in writing to the appropriate office in person or by mail within 60 days from the date of the termination notice. The appeal must be signed by the occupant and state the reasons why the assistance or occupancy should not be terminated. If a hearing is desired, the appeal should so state.

(C) *Response to appeal.* If a hearing pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section has not been requested, the occupant has waived the right to a hearing. The appropriate program official shall deliver or mail a written response to the occupant within 5 business days after the receipt of the appeal.

(D) *Request for hearing.* If the occupant requests a hearing pursuant to paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, FEMA shall schedule a hearing date within 10 business days from the receipt of the appeal, at a time and place reasonably convenient to the occupant, who shall be notified promptly thereof in writing. The notice of hearing shall specify the procedure governing the hearing.

(E) *Hearing*—(*1*) *Hearing officer.* The hearing shall be conducted by a Hearing Officer, who shall be designated by the Regional Administrator, and who shall not have been involved with the decision to terminate the occupant's temporary housing assistance, nor be a subordinate of any individual who was so involved.

(*2*) *Due process.* The occupant shall be afforded a fair hearing and provided the basic safeguards of due process, including cross-examination of the responsible official(s), access to the documents on which FEMA is relying, the right to counsel, the right to present evidence, and the right to a written decision.

(*3*) *Failure to appear.* If an occupant fails to appear at a hearing, the Hearing Officer may make a determination that the occupant has waived the right to a hearing, or may, for good cause shown, postpone the hearing for no more than 5 business days.

(*4*) *Proof.* At the hearing, the occupant must first attempt to establish that continued assistance is appropriate; thereafter, FEMA must sustain the burden of proof in justifying that termination of assistance is appropriate. The occupant shall have the right to present evidence and arguments in support of their complaint, to controvert evidence relied on by FEMA, and to cross examine all witnesses on whose testimony or information FEMA relies. The hearing shall be conducted by the Hearing Officer, and any evidence pertinent to the facts and issues raised may be received without regard to its admissibility under rules of evidence employed in formal judicial proceedings.

(F) *Decision.* The decision of the Hearing Officer shall be based solely upon applicable Federal and State law, and FEMA regulations and requirements promulgated thereunder. The Hearing Officer shall prepare a written decision setting forth a statement of findings and conclusions together with the reasons therefor, concerning all material issues raised by the complainant within 5 business days after the hearing. The decision of the Hearing Officer shall be binding on FEMA, which shall take all actions necessary to carry out the decision or refrain from any actions prohibited by the decision.

(*1*) The decision shall include a notice to the occupant that he/she must vacate the premises within 3 days of receipt of the written notice or on the termination date stated in the original notice of termination, as required in paragraph (m)(2)(i) of this section, whichever is later. If the occupant does not quit the premises, appropriate action shall be taken and, if suit is brought, the occupant may be required to pay court costs and attorney fees.

(*2*) If the occupant is required to give a specific number of days' notice which exceeds the number of days in the termination notice, the Regional Administrator may approve the payment of rent for this period of time if requested by the occupant.

(n) *Disposition of temporary housing units*—(1) *Acquisition.* The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may purchase mobile homes or other manufactured housing units for those who require temporary housing. After such temporary housing is vacated, it shall be returned to one of the FEMA-operated Strategic Storage Centers for refurbishment and storage until needed in a subsequent major disaster or emergency. When returning the unit to a Strategic Storage Center is not feasible or cost effective, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may prescribe a different method of disposition in accordance with applicable Federal statutes and regulations.

(2) *Sales*—(i) *Eligibility.* When adequate alternate housing is not available, the Regional Administrator shall make available for sale directly to a temporary housing occupant(s) any mobile home or manufactured housing unit acquired by purchase, in accordance with the following:

(A) The unit is to be used as a primary residence;

(B) The purchaser has a site that complies with local codes and ordinances as well as FEMA's floodplain management regulations at 44 CFR part 9 (in particular § 9.13(e)); and

(C) The purchaser has sufficient funds to purchase and, if necessary, relocate the unit. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may approve the sale of a mobile home or manufactured housing unit to a temporary housing occupant when adequate alternate housing is available but only when such sales are clearly in the best interest of the Government.

(ii) *Sales price.* Units shall be sold at prices that are fair and equitable to the purchaser and to the Government, as determined by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate. The purchaser shall pay the total sales price at the time of sale.

(iii) Adjustment to the sales price.

(A) Adjustments to the sales price may be provided only when both of the following conditions are met:

(*1*) There is a need to purchase the unit for use as the purchaser's primary residence because other adequate alternate housing is unavailable. Adequate alternate housing must meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and may consist of:

(*i*) Existing housing;

(*ii*) Additional resources such as disaster-damaged rental accommodations which can reasonably be expected to be repaired and become available in the near future;

(*iii*) New housing construction or housing to be made available through Government subsidy which is included in the immediate recovery plans for the area; and

(*iv*) Residences which can be repaired by the predisaster owner/occupant through funds available from insurance, other disaster assistance programs, or through their own resources.

(*2*) In addition to his/her resources, the purchaser cannot obtain sufficient funds through insurance proceeds, disaster loans, grants, and commercial lending institutions to cover the sales price.

(B) To determine the adjusted sales price, the current available financial resources of the purchaser shall be calculated. If the financial resources are equal to or greater than the basic sales price, then no adjustment shall be approved. If the purchaser's financial resources are less than the basic sales price, the sales price shall be adjusted to take into consideration the financial resources available but shall include some consideration. Deviations from this rule may be reviewed on a case-by-case basis by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate.

(C) The Regional Administrator must approve all adjustments to the sales price of a mobile home.

(iv) Other conditions of sale.

(A) A unit shall be sold “as is, where is” except for repairs necessary to protect health or safety, which are to be completed prior to sale. There shall be no implied warranties. In addition, the purchaser must be informed that he/she may have to bring the unit up to codes and standards which are applicable at the proposed site.

(B) In accordance with the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, Public Law 93-234, as amended, the sale of a unit for the purpose of meeting the permanent housing need of an individual or family may not be approved where the unit would be placed in a designated special flood hazard area which has been identified by the Administrator for at least 1 year as floodprone unless the community in which the unit is to be located after the sale is, at the time of approval, participating in the National Flood Insurance Program. The purchaser must agree to buy and maintain an adequate flood insurance policy for as long as the unit is occupied by the purchaser. An adequate policy for purposes of this paragraph shall mean one which provides coverage for the basic sales price of the unit. The purchaser must provide proof of purchase of the initial flood insurance policy.

(3) *Transfer.* The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may lend temporary housing units purchased under section 408(a) of the Act directly to States, other Governmental entities, or voluntary organizations. Such transfers may be made only in connection with a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency. Donations may be made only when it is in the best interest of the Government, such as when future re-use by the Federal Government would not be economically feasible. As a condition of such transfers, the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate shall require that the recipient:

(i) Utilize the units for the purpose of providing temporary housing for victims of major disasters or emergencies in accordance with the written agreement; and

(ii) Comply with the current applicable FEMA policies and regulations, including this section; 44 CFR part 9 (especially §§ 9.13 and 9.14), Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands; 44 CFR part 10, Environmental Considerations. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may order returned any temporary housing unit made available under this section which is not used in accordance with the terms of transfer.

(o) *Reports.* The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, Regional Administrator, or Federal Coordinating Officer may require from field operations such reports, plans, and evaluations as they deem necessary to carry out their responsibilities under the Act and these regulations.

(p) *Federal responsibility.* The Federal financial and operational responsibility for the Temporary Housing Assistance program shall not exceed 18 months from the date of the declaration of the major disaster or emergency. This period may be extended in writing by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate, based on a determination that an extension is necessary and in the public interest. The Regional Administrator may authorize continued use on a non-reimbursable basis of Government property, office space, and equipment by a State, other Government entity, or voluntary organization after the 18 month period.

(q) *Applicant notification*—(1) *General.* All applicants for temporary housing assistance will be notified regarding the type and amount of assistance for which they are qualified. Whenever practicable, such notification will be provided within 7 days of their application and will be in writing.

(2) Eligible applicants for temporary housing assistance will be provided information regarding:

(i) All forms of housing assistance available;

(ii) The criteria which must be met to qualify for each type of assistance;

(iii) Any limitations which apply to each type of assistance; and

(iv) The address and telephone number of offices responsible for responding to appeals and requests for changes in the type or amount of assistance provided.

(r) *Location.* In providing temporary housing assistance, consideration will be given to the location of:

(1) The eligible applicants' home and place of business;

(2) Schools which the eligible applicant or members of the household attend; and

(3) Agricultural activities which provide 25 percent or more of the eligible applicants' annual income.

(s) *NonFederal administration of temporary housing assistance.* A State may request authority to administer all or part of the temporary housing assistance program in the Governor's request for a declaration or in a subsequent written request to the Regional Administrator from the Governor or his/her authorized representative. The Associate Director shall approve such a request based on the Regional Administrator's recommendation and based on a finding that State administration is both in the interest of the Federal Government and those needing temporary housing assistance. The State must have an approved plan prior to the incident and an approved operational annex within 3 days of the declaration in order to administer the program.
