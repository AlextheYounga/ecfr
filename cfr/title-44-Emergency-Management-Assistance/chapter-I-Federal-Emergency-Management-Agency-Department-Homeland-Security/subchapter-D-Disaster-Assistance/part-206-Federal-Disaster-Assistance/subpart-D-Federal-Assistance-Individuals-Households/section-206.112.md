(b) *Extension of the registration period.* The regional administrator or his/her designee may extend the registration period when the State requests more time to collect registrations from the affected population. The Regional Administrator or his/her designee may also extend the standard registration period when necessary to establish the same registration deadline for contiguous counties or States.
