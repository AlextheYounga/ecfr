##### § 1204.305 Approved procedures for guidance documents identified as “significant” or “otherwise of importance to the NASA's interests.” #####

(a) For guidance proposed by a NASA responsible office, if there is a reasonable possibility the guidance may be considered “significant” or “otherwise of importance to NASA's interests” within the meaning of § 1204.306 or if the NASA responsible office is uncertain whether the guidance may qualify as such, the NASA responsible office should email a copy of the proposed guidance document (or a summary of it) to OGC for review and further direction before issuance. Unless exempt, each proposed NASA guidance document determined to be significant or otherwise of importance to NASA's interests must be approved by the NASA Administrator before issuance. In such instances, the NASA Mission Support Directorate (MSD) will:

(1) Request that the proposing NASA responsible office obtain a RIN to report what NASA is planning to issue;

(2) Coordinate the guidance document with OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for the interagency review, final significance determination, and clearance; and

(3) Advise the NASA responsible office on coordinating the guidance document for an internal NASA review before submitting it to the NASA Administrator for approval.

(b) If the guidance document is determined not to be either significant or otherwise of importance to NASA's interests within the meaning of § 1204.306, OGC will advise the NASA responsible office to proceed with issuance of the guidance through the NASA MSD for publication in the Federal Register. For each guidance document coordinated through the NASA MSD, the issuing NASA responsible office should include a statement in the action memorandum indicating that the guidance document has been reviewed and cleared in accordance with this process.
