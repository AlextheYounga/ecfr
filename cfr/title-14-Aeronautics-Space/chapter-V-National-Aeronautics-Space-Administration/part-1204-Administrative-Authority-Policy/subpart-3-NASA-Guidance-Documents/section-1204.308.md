##### § 1204.308 Notice-and-comment procedures. #####

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all proposed NASA guidance documents determined to be a “significant guidance document” within the meaning of § 1204.306 are subject to notice-and-comment procedures. The issuing NASA responsible office shall publish an advance notice in the Federal Register of the proposed guidance document and invite public comments for a minimum of 30 days, then publish a response to major concerns raised in the comments when the final guidance document is published.

(b) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section will not apply to any significant guidance document or categories of significant guidance documents for which OGC finds, in consultation with OIRA, the proposing NASA responsible office, and the NASA Administrator, good cause that notice-and-comment procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest (and incorporates the finding of good cause and a brief statement of reasons in the guidance issued). Unless the NASA responsible office, in consultation with OGC, advises otherwise in writing, the categories of guidance exempted pursuant to an agreement between NASA and OIRA will be exempt from the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Where appropriate, the NASA responsible office, in consultation with OGC, may recommend to the NASA Administrator that a particular guidance document that is otherwise of importance to NASA's interests shall also be subject to the informal notice-and-comment procedures described in paragraph (a) of this section.
