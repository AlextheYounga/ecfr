##### § 1204.307 Designation procedures. #####

(a) OGC may request a NASA responsible office to prepare a designation request for their respective guidance document. Designation requests must include the following information:

(1) A summary of the guidance document; and

(2) The NASA responsible office's recommended designation of “not significant,” “significant,” or “economically significant,” as well as a justification for that designation.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the NASA MSD will seek significance determinations from OIRA. Prior to publishing these guidance documents, and with sufficient time to allow OIRA to review the document in the event that a significance determination is made, the NASA MSD should provide OIRA with an opportunity to review the designation request or the guidance document, if requested, to determine if it meets the definition of “significant” or “economically significant” under Executive Order 13891.

(c) Unless they present novel issues, significant risks, interagency considerations, unusual circumstances, or other unique issues, the categories of guidance documents exempted pursuant to an agreement between NASA and OIRA do not require designation by OIRA.
