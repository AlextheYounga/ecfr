##### § 1204.1403 Available airport facilities. #####

Link to an amendment published at 86 FR 50624, Sept. 10, 2021.

The facilities available vary at each NASA Installation having an airfield. The airport facilities available are:

(a) *Shuttle Landing Facility* - (1) *Runways.* Runway 15-33 is 15,000 feet long and 300 feet wide with 1,000-foot overruns. The first 3,500 feet at each end of the runway have been modified for smoothness. The center 8,000 feet of the runway is grooved for improved braking under wet conditions.

(2) *Parking Areas and Hangar Space.* No hangar space is available. Limited available concrete parking ramp space makes precoordination necessary.

(3) *Control Tower.* The control tower is normally in operation from 0800 to 1600 local time, Monday through Friday. Additional hours of operation are filed with the St. Petersburg Flight Service Station (FSS). The tower may be contacted on 128.55 MHz or 284.0 MHz. FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports with an operating control tower (§ 91.87 of this title) will apply. When the tower is not in operation, the FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports without an operating control tower (§ 91.89 of this title) will apply.

(4) *Navigation aids.* A Microwave Scanning Beam Landing System (MSBLS) and a Tactical Airborne Navigation System (TACAN) are installed at the Facility. There are two published TACAN approaches and an approved and published nondirectional beacon (NDB) approach available from Titusville. Runway approach lighting (similar to Category II ALSF-2) and edge lights are available by prior arrangement.

(5) *Hazards.* There are towers and buildings south, southeast, and northeast of the facility as high as 550 feet that could pose hazards to air navigation. All are marked with obstruction lights.

(6) *Emergency Equipment.* Aircraft Rescue and Fire-fighting (ARFF) equipment will be provided in accordance with 14 CFR part 139.

(b) *Wallops Airport* - (1) *Runways.* There are three hard surfaced runways in satisfactory condition. The runways and taxiways are concrete and/or asphalt. Runway 10-28 is 8,000 feet long, 200 feet wide with maximum wheel load of 57,500 pounds; runway 04-22 is 8,750 feet long, 150 feet wide with maximum wheel load of 57,500 pounds; and runway 17-35 is 4,820 feet long, 150 feet wide with maximum wheel load of 14,700 pounds.

(2) *Parking Areas and Hangar Space.* No hangar space is available. However, limited concrete parking ramp space is available as directed by the control tower.

(3) *Control Tower.* This control tower is normally in operation from 0630 to 1830 local time, Monday through Friday, excluding Federal holidays. The tower may be contacted on 126.5 MHz or 394.3 MHz. When the tower is in operation, FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports with an operating tower (§ 91.87 of this title) will apply. When the tower is not in operation, all aircraft operations will be handled by Wallops UNICOM on the tower frequency, and FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports without an operating control tower (§ 91.89 of this title) will apply. In addition to Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR's) (s 91 of this title), Wallops requires that pilots obtain clearances from the Wallops UNICOM before landings, takeoffs, and taxiing. Civil aircraft operations are normally confined to daylight hours.

(4) *Navigation Aids.* All runways, 04-22, 10-28, and 17-35 are lighted. Both active taxiways, parallels 04-22 and 10-28, are lighted. Airfield lighting is available upon request. All runway approaches are equipped with operating precision approach path indicator (PAPI) systems and are available on request. All airfield obstructions are equipped with red obstruction lights.

(5) *Hazards.* Numerous towers in airport vicinity up to 241 feet above ground level. Existing tree obstructions are located 1500 feet west of runway 10 threshold. High shore bird population exists in the Wallops area. Deer occasionally venture across runways. Light-controlled traffic crossovers are in existence. Potential radio frequency (RF) hazards exist from tracking radars. Hazards involving aircraft and rocket launch operations exist when Restricted Area R-6604 is active.

(6) *Emergency Equipment.* Aircraft rescue and fire-fighting equipment is normally available on a continuous basis.

(c) *Moffett Federal Airfield* - (1) *Runways.* There are two parallel runways, 32-14, both in satisfactory to good condition. The runways and taxiways are concrete and/or asphalt. Runway 32R-14L is 9,200 feet long, 200 feet wide; 32L-14R is 8,125 feet long, 200 feet wide with a 600 foot displaced threshold on 32L.

(2) *Parking areas and hangar space.* Hangar space is not available; concrete parking ramp space is available as directed by the control tower.

(3) *Control tower.* The control tower normally operates from 0700 to 2300 local time, 7 days a week, excluding Federal holidays. The tower frequencies are 126.2 Mhz, 353.2 Mhz, and 340.2 Mhz. When the tower is operating, FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports with an operating tower (§ 91.87 of this title) will apply. When the tower is not in operation, all aircraft operations will be conducted by Moffett UNICOM on the tower frequency. FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports without an operating control tower (§ 91.89 of this title) will apply.

(4) *Navigation aids.* An Instrument Landing System (ILS) is installed. An ILS/DME approach to runway 32R and an LOC/DME approach to runway 14L are published in DOD Flight Information Publication (Terminal), Low Altitude United States, Volume 2. ILS frequency is 110.35 Mhz, identifiers are Runway 32R, I-NUQ; Runway 14L, I-MNQ; Tactical Airborne Navigation (TACAN) (DME) is Channel 123, identifier is NUQ. Precision Approach Path Indicators (PAPI) are to be installed by July 1, 1995, to provide visual reference for the ILS and LOC approaches to runways 32R and 14L. A TACAN with approved and published approaches is operational at the facility (identification is NUQ, Channel 123). A Radio Controlled Lighting System (RCLS) is operational for the runway lights on 32R-14L; 3 clicks within 5 seconds, low intensity; 5 clicks, medium intensity; 7 clicks, high intensity (tower frequency, 126.2 Mhz). Lights automatically extinguish after 15 minutes.

(5) *Hazards.* Large blimp hangars (approximately 200 feet high) bracket the parallel runways, one on the west side, two on the east side. A freeway at the approach end of 32L displaces the threshold 600 feet.

(6) *Emergency equipment.* Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) equipment is provided by the California Air National Guard continuously in accordance with U.S. Air Force Regulations.

(d) *Crows Landing Airport* - (1) *Runways.* There are two concrete runways, 35-17 and 30-12, both in satisfactory condition. Parallel taxiways are asphalt overlay or concrete. Runway 35-17 is 7,950 feet long, 200 feet wide; runway 30-12 is 6,975 feet long, 200 feet wide.

(2) *Parking areas and hangar space.* Hangars/hangar space do not exist; concrete parking ramp space is available as directed by the control tower.

(3) *Control tower.* The control tower normally operates only when research flight is scheduled by NASA-Ames. The airfield is closed at all other times except as arranged by other Federal users with the Chief, Airfield Management Office, Moffett Federal Airfield. The tower frequencies are 125.05 Mhz, 126.2 Mhz, 328.1 Mhz, and 337.8 Mhz. When the tower is operating, FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports with an operating tower (§ 91.87 of this title) will apply. When the tower is not operating, all aircraft operations will be conducted with Crows Landing UNICOM on the primary tower frequency. FAA regulations pertaining to the operation of aircraft at airports without an operating control tower (§ 91.89 of this title) will apply.

(4) *Navigation aids.* Crows Landing Airport is a VFR facility. No certified NAVAIDS or published approach procedures exist.

(5) *Hazards.* Crows Landing Airport is located in an agricultural area. No obstructions exist within or immediately adjacent to the airspace. The most persistent potential hazard is that of agricultural aircraft (crop dusters) without radios which transit the airspace.

(6) *Emergency equipment.* Aircraft Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) equipment and services are provided by the California Air National Guard only during published hours of operation.

(e) *Other facilities.* No facilities or services other than those described above are available except on an individual emergency basis to any user.

(f) *Status of facilities.* Changes to the status of the KSC, WFF, MFA, and CLFF facilities will be published in appropriate current FAA or DOD aeronautical publications.
