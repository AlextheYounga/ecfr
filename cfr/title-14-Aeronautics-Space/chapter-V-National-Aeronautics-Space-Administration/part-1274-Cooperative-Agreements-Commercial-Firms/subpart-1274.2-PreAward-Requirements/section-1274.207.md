##### ยง 1274.207 Extended agreements. #####

(a) Multiple year cooperative agreements are encouraged, but normally they should span no more than three years.

(b) Cooperative agreements that will exceed $5 million and have a period of performance in excess of 5 years shall require the approval of the Assistant Administrator for Procurement prior to award. Requests for approval shall include a justification for exceeding 5 years and evidence that the extended years can be reasonably priced. Requests for approval are not required when the 5-year limitation is exceeded due to a no cost extension.

(c) Cooperative agreement renewals provide for the continuation of research beyond the original scope, period of performance and funding levels; therefore, new proposals, certifications, and technical evaluations are required prior to the execution of a cooperative agreement renewal. Renewals will be awarded as new cooperative agreements. Continued performance within a period specified under a multiple year cooperative agreement provision does not constitute a renewal.

(d) The provisions set forth in ยง 1274.901 are generally considered appropriate for agreements not exceeding 3 years and/or a Government cash contribution not exceeding $20M. For cooperative agreements expected to be longer than 3 years and/or involve Government cash contributions exceeding $20M, consideration should be given to provisions which place additional restrictions on the recipient in terms of validating performance and accounting for funds expended.
