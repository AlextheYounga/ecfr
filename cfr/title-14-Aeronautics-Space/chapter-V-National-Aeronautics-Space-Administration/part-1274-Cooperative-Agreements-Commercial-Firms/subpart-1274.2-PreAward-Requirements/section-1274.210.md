(1) Be innovative and unique;

(2) Be independently originated and developed by the recipient;

(b) For each unsolicited proposal selected for award, the cognizant technical office will prepare and furnish to the Agreement Officer, a justification for acceptance of an unsolicited proposal (JAUP). The JAUP shall be submitted for the approval of the agreement officer after review and concurrence at a level above the technical officer.
