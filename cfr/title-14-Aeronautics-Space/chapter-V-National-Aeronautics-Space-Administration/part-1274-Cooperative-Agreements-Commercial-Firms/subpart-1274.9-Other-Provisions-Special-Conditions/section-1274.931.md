Payments under this cooperative agreement will be made by the Government by electronic funds transfer through the Treasury Fedline Payment System (FEDLINE) or the Automated Clearing House (ACH), at the option of the Government.

(2) The American Bankers Association 9-digit identifying number for wire transfers of the financing institution receiving payment if the institution has access to the Federal Reserve Communication System.

(3) Payee's account number at the financial institution where funds are to be transferred.

(4) If the financial institution does not have access to the Federal Reserve Communications System, name, address, and telegraphic abbreviation of the correspondent financial institution through which the financial institution receiving payment obtains wire transfer activity. Provide the telegraphic abbreviation and American Bankers Association identifying number for the correspondent institution.

(1) Routing transit number of the financial institution receiving payment (same as American Bankers Association identifying number used for FEDLINE).

(2) Number of account to which funds are to be deposited.

(3) Type of depositor account (“C” for checking, “S” for savings).

(4) If the Recipient is a new enrollee to the ACH system, a “Payment Information Form,” SF 3881, must be completed before payment can be processed.

(c) In the event the Recipient, during the performance of this cooperative agreement, elects to designate a different financial institution for the receipt of any payment made using electronic funds transfer procedures, notification of such change and the required information specified above must be received by the appropriate Government official 30 days prior to the date such change is to become effective.

(d) The documents furnishing the information required in this clause must be dated and contain the signature, title, and telephone number of the Recipient official authorized to provide it, as well as the Recipient's name and contract number.

(e) Failure to properly designate a financial institution or to provide appropriate payee bank account information may delay payments of amounts otherwise properly due.
