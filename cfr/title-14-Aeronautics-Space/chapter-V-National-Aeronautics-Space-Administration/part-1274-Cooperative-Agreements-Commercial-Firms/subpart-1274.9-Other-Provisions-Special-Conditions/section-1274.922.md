Suspension or TerminationJuly 2002

(a) This cooperative agreement may be suspended or terminated in whole or in part by the Recipient or by NASA after consultation with the other party. With prior written notice, NASA may terminate the agreement, for example, if the Recipient is not making anticipated technical progress, if the Recipient materially fails to comply with the terms of the agreement, if the Recipient materially changes the objective of the agreement, or if appropriated funds are not available to support the program.

(b) Upon fifteen (15) days written notice to the other party, either party may temporarily suspend the cooperative agreement, pending corrective action or a decision to terminate the cooperative agreement. The notice should express the reasons why the agreement is being suspended.

(c) In the event of termination by either party, the Recipient shall not be entitled to additional funds or payments except as may be required by the Recipient to meet NASA's share of commitments which had in the judgment of NASA become firm prior to the effective date of termination and are otherwise appropriate. In no event, shall these additional funds or payments exceed the amount of the next payable milestone billing amount.
