##### § 1261.409 Contracting for collection services. #####

Link to an amendment published at 82 FR 29385, June 29, 2017.

(a) When NASA determines that there is a need to contract for collection services, the following conditions must attach:

(1) The authority to resolve disputes, compromise claims, suspend or terminate collection action, and refer the matter for litigation must be retained by NASA.

(2) The contractor shall be subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, to the extent specified in 5 U.S.C. 552a(m), and to applicable Federal and State laws and regulations pertaining to debt collection practices - for example, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. 1692), and 26 U.S.C. 6103(p)(4) and applicable regulations of the Internal Revenue Service;

(3) The contractor must be required to account strictly for all amounts collected; and

(4) The contractor must agree to provide any data contained in its files relating to collection actions and related reports, current address of debtor, and reasonably current credit information upon returning an account to NASA for subsequent referral to the Department of Justice for litigation.

(b) Funding of collection service contracts:

(1) NASA may fund a collection service contract on a fixed-fee basis - that is, payment of a fixed fee determined without regard to the amount actually collected under the contract. However, such contract may be entered into only if and to the extent provided in the appropriation act or other legislation, except that this requirement does not apply to the use of a revolving fund authorized by statute. Accordingly, payment of the fixed-fee must be charged to available agency appropriations. See 4 CFR 102.6(b)(1) and (3).

(2) NASA may also fund a collection service contract on a contingent-fee basis - that is, by including a provision in the contract permitting the contractor to deduct its fee from amounts collected under the contract. The fee should be based on a percentage of the amount collected, consistent with prevailing commercial practice. See 4 CFR 102.6(b)(2).

(3) Except as authorized under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, or unless otherwise specifically provided by law, NASA must deposit all amounts recovered under collection service contracts (or by NASA employees on behalf of the agency) in the Treasury Department as miscellaneous receipts pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3302. See 4 CFR 102.6(b)(4).
