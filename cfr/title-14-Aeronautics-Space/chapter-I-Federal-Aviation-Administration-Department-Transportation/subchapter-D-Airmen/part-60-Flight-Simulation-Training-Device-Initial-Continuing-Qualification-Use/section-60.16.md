(i) Consisting of all the elements of an initial evaluation for qualification in those circumstances where the NSPM has determined that all the elements of an initial evaluation for qualification is necessary; or

(ii) Consisting of those elements of an initial evaluation for qualification designated as necessary by the NSPM.

(c) The FSTD is qualified for the additional uses when the NSPM issues an amended Statement of Qualification in accordance with § 60.15(h).

(d) The sponsor may not modify the FSTD except as described in § 60.23.
