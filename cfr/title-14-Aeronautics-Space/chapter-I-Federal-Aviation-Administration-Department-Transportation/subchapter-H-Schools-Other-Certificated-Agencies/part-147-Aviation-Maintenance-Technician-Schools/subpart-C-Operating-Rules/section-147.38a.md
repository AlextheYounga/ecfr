##### § 147.38a Quality of instruction. #####

Each certificated aviation maintenance technician school shall provide instruction of such quality that, of its graduates of a curriculum for each rating who apply for a mechanic certificate or additional rating within 60 days after they are graduated, the percentage of those passing the applicable FAA written tests on their first attempt during any period of 24 calendar months is at least the percentage figured as follows:

(a) For a school graduating fewer than 51 students during that period - the national passing norm minus the number 20.

(b) For a school graduating at least 51, but fewer than 201, students during that period - the national passing norm minus the number 15.

(c) For a school graduating more than 200 students during that period - the national passing norm minus the number 10.

As used in this section, “national passing norm” is the number representing the percentage of all graduates (of a curriculum for a particular rating) of all certificated aviation maintenance technician schools who apply for a mechanic certificate or additional rating within 60 days after they are graduated and pass the applicable FAA written tests on their first attempt during the period of 24 calendar months described in this section.[Amdt. 147-2, 35 FR 5534, Apr. 3, 1970, as amended by Amdt. 147-3, 41 FR 47230, Oct. 28, 1976]
