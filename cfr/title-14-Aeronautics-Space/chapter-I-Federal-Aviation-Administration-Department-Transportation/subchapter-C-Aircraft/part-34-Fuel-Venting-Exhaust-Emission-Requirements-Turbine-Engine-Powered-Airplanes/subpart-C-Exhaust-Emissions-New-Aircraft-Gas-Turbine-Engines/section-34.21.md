Hydrocarbons: 140 (0.92)rPR g/kN rO.

(e) Smoke exhaust emissions from each gas turbine engine shall not exceed:

(1)(A) For Class TF of rated output less than 26.7 kN (6,000 lbf) manufactured on or after August 9, 1985, and before July 18, 2012:

SN = 83.6(rO)−0.274 (rO is in kN) not to exceed a maximum of SN = 50.

(f) The standards set forth in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section refer to a composite gaseous emission sample representing the operation cycles and exhaust smoke emission emitted during operation of the engine as specified in the applicable sections of subpart G of this part, and measured and calculated in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart G.

(g) Where a gaseous emission standard is specified by a formula, calculate and round the standard to three significant figures or to the nearest 0.1 g/kN (for standards at or above 100 g/kN). Where a smoke standard is specified by a formula, calculate and round the standard to the nearest 0.1 SN. Engines comply with an applicable standard if the testing results show that the engine type certificate family's characteristic level does not exceed the numerical level of that standard, as described in § 34.60.
