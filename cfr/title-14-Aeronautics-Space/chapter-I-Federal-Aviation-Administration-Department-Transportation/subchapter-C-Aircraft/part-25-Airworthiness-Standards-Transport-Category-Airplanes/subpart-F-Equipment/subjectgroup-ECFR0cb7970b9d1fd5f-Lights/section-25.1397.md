##### § 25.1397 Color specifications. #####

Each position light color must have the applicable International Commission on Illumination chromaticity coordinates as follows:

(a) *Aviation red*—

*y* is not greater than 0.335; and *z* is not greater than 0.002.

(b) *Aviation green*—

*x* is not greater than 0.440−0.320*y* ; *x* is not greater than *y*−0.170; and *y* is not less than 0.390−0.170*x*.

(c) *Aviation white*—

*x* is not less than 0.300 and not greater than 0.540; *y* is not less than *x*−0.040; or *y*0−0.010, whichever is the smaller; and *y* is not greater than *x* + 0.020 nor 0.636−0.400*x*; Where *y*0 is the *y* coordinate of the Planckian radiator for the value of *x* considered.[Doc.
