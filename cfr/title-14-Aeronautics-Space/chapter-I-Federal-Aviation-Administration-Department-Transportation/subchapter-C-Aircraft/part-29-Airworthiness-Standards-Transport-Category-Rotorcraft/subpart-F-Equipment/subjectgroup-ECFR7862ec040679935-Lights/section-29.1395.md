##### § 29.1395 Maximum intensities in overlapping beams of forward and rear position lights. #####

No position light intensity may exceed the applicable values in the following table, except as provided in § 29.1389(b)(3).

|           Overlaps           |Maximum intensity|   |
|------------------------------|-----------------|---|
|       Area A (candles)       |Area B (candles) |   |
|  Green in dihedral angle L   |       10        | 1 |
|   Red in dihedral angle R    |       10        | 1 |
|  Green in dihedral angle A   |        5        | 1 |
|   Red in dihedral angle A    |        5        | 1 |
|Rear white in dihedral angle L|        5        | 1 |
|Rear white in dihedral angle R|        5        | 1 |

Where—

(a) Area A includes all directions in the adjacent dihedral angle that pass through the light source and intersect the common boundary plane at more than 10 degrees but less than 20 degrees; and

(b) Area B includes all directions in the adjacent dihedral angle that pass through the light source and intersect the common boundary plane at more than 20 degrees.
