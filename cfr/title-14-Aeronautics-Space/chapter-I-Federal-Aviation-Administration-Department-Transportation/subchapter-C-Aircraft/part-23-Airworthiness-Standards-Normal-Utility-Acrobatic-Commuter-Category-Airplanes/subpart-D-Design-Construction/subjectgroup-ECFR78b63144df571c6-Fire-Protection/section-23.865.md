##### ยง 23.865 Fire protection of flight controls, engine mounts, and other flight structure. #####

Flight controls, engine mounts, and other flight structure located in designated fire zones, or in adjacent areas that would be subjected to the effects of fire in the designated fire zones, must be constructed of fireproof material or be shielded so that they are capable of withstanding the effects of a fire. Engine vibration isolators must incorporate suitable features to ensure that the engine is retained if the non-fireproof portions of the isolators deteriorate from the effects of a fire.
