(a) Each landing gear wheel must have a tire whose approved tire ratings (static and dynamic) are not exceeded -

(1) By a load on each main wheel tire) to be compared to the static rating approved for such tires) equal to the corresponding static ground reaction under the design maximum weight and critical center of gravity; and

(2) By a load on nose wheel tires (to be compared with the dynamic rating approved for such tires) equal to the reaction obtained at the nose wheel, assuming the mass of the airplane to be concentrated at the most critical center of gravity and exerting a force of 1.0 W downward and 0.31 W forward (where W is the design maximum weight), with the reactions distributed to the nose and main wheels by the principles of statics and with the drag reaction at the ground applied only at wheels with brakes.

(b) If specially constructed tires are used, the wheels must be plainly and conspicuously marked to that effect. The markings must include the make, size, number of plies, and identification marking of the proper tire.

(c) Each tire installed on a retractable landing gear system must, at the maximum size of the tire type expected in service, have a clearance to surrounding structure and systems that is adequate to prevent contact between the tire and any part of the structure of systems.
