(a) Each pilot compartment must be -

(1) Arranged with sufficiently extensive, clear and undistorted view to enable the pilot to safely taxi, takeoff, approach, land, and perform any maneuvers within the operating limitations of the airplane.

(2) Free from glare and reflections that could interfere with the pilot's vision. Compliance must be shown in all operations for which certification is requested; and

(3) Designed so that each pilot is protected from the elements so that moderate rain conditions do not unduly impair the pilot's view of the flight path in normal flight and while landing.

(b) Each pilot compartment must have a means to either remove or prevent the formation of fog or frost on an area of the internal portion of the windshield and side windows sufficiently large to provide the view specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Compliance must be shown under all expected external and internal ambient operating conditions, unless it can be shown that the windshield and side windows can be easily cleared by the pilot without interruption of normal pilot duties.
