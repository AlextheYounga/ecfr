##### ยง 23.787 Baggage and cargo compartments. #####

(a) Each baggage and cargo compartment must:

(1) Be designed for its placarded maximum weight of contents and for the critical load distributions at the appropriate maximum load factors corresponding to the flight and ground load conditions of this part.

(3) Have a means to protect occupants from injury by the contents of any compartment, located aft of the occupants and separated by structure, when the ultimate forward inertial load factor is 9g and assuming the maximum allowed baggage or cargo weight for the compartment.

(b) Designs that provide for baggage or cargo to be carried in the same compartment as passengers must have a means to protect the occupants from injury when the baggage or cargo is subjected to the inertial loads resulting from the ultimate static load factors of ยง 23.561(b)(3), assuming the maximum allowed baggage or cargo weight for the compartment.
