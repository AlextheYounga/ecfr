|    Trim tabs (or equivalent)    |Switch motion or mechanical rotation of control to produce similar rotation of the airplane about an axis parallel to the axis control. Axis of roll trim control may be displaced to accommodate comfortable actuation by the pilot. For single-engine airplanes, direction of pilot's hand movement must be in the same sense as airplane response for rudder trim if only a portion of a rotational element is accessible.|
