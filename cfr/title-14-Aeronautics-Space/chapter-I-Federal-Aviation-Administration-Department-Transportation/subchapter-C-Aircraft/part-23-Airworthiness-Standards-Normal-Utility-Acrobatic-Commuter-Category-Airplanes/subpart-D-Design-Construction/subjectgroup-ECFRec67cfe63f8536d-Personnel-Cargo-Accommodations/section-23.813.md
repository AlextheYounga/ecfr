##### ยง 23.813 Emergency exit access. #####

(a) For commuter category airplanes, access to window-type emergency exits may not be obstructed by seats or seat backs.

(b) In addition, when certification to the emergency exit provisions of ยง 23.807(d)(4) is requested, the following emergency exit access must be provided:

(1) The passageway leading from the aisle to the passenger entry door must be unobstructed and at least 20 inches wide.

(2) There must be enough space next to the passenger entry door to allow assistance in evacuation of passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway below 20 inches.

(3) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between passenger compartments to reach a required emergency exit from any seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must be unobstructed; however, curtains may be used if they allow free entry through the passageway.

(4) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger compartments unless that door has a means to latch it in the open position. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it by the door when the door is subjected to the inertia loads resulting from the ultimate static load factors prescribed in ยง 23.561(b)(2).

(5) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the passenger cabin from other areas to reach a required emergency exit from any passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in the open position. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it by the door when the door is subjected to the inertia loads resulting from the ultimate static load factors prescribed in ยง 23.561(b)(2).
