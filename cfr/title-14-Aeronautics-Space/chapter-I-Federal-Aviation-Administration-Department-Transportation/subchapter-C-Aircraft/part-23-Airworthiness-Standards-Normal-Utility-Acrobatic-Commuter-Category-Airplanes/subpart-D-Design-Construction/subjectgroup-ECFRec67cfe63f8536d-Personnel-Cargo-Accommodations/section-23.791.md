##### ยง 23.791 Passenger information signs. #####

For those airplanes in which the flightcrew members cannot observe the other occupants' seats or where the flightcrew members' compartment is separated from the passenger compartment, there must be at least one illuminated sign (using either letters or symbols) notifying all passengers when seat belts should be fastened. Signs that notify when seat belts should be fastened must:

(a) When illuminated, be legible to each person seated in the passenger compartment under all probable lighting conditions; and

(b) Be installed so that a flightcrew member can, when seated at the flightcrew member's station, turn the illumination on and off.
