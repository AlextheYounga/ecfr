##### ยง 23.1143 Engine controls. #####

(a) There must be a separate power or thrust control for each engine and a separate control for each supercharger that requires a control.

(b) Power, thrust, and supercharger controls must be arranged to allow -

(1) Separate control of each engine and each supercharger; and

(2) Simultaneous control of all engines and all superchargers.

(c) Each power, thrust, or supercharger control must give a positive and immediate responsive means of controlling its engine or supercharger.

(d) The power, thrust, or supercharger controls for each engine or supercharger must be independent of those for every other engine or supercharger.

(e) For each fluid injection (other than fuel) system and its controls not provided and approved as part of the engine, the applicant must show that the flow of the injection fluid is adequately controlled.

(f) If a power, thrust, or a fuel control (other than a mixture control) incorporates a fuel shutoff feature, the control must have a means to prevent the inadvertent movement of the control into the off position. The means must -

(1) Have a positive lock or stop at the idle position; and

(2) Require a separate and distinct operation to place the control in the shutoff position.

(g) For reciprocating single-engine airplanes, each power or thrust control must be designed so that if the control separates at the engine fuel metering device, the airplane is capable of continued safe flight and landing.
