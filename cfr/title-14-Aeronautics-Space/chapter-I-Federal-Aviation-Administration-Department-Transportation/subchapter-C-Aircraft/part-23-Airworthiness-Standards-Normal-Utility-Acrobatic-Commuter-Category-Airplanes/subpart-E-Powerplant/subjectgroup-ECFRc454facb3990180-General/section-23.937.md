##### ยง 23.937 Turbopropeller-drag limiting systems. #####

(a) Turbopropeller-powered airplane propeller-drag limiting systems must be designed so that no single failure or malfunction of any of the systems during normal or emergency operation results in propeller drag in excess of that for which the airplane was designed under the structural requirements of this part. Failure of structural elements of the drag limiting systems need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is extremely remote.

(b) As used in this section, drag limiting systems include manual or automatic devices that, when actuated after engine power loss, can move the propeller blades toward the feather position to reduce windmilling drag to a safe level.
