##### ยง 23.1045 Cooling test procedures for turbine engine powered airplanes. #####

(a) Compliance with ยง 23.1041 must be shown for all phases of operation. The airplane must be flown in the configurations, at the speeds, and following the procedures recommended in the Airplane Flight Manual for the relevant stage of flight, that correspond to the applicable performance requirements that are critical to cooling.

(b) Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which entry is made into each stage of flight being investigated, unless the entry condition normally is not one during which component and engine fluid temperatures would stabilize (in which case, operation through the full entry condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight being investigated in order to allow temperatures to reach their natural levels at the time of entry). The takeoff cooling test must be preceded by a period during which the powerplant component and engine fluid temperatures are stabilized with the engines at ground idle.

(c) Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until -

(1) The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize;

(2) The stage of flight is completed; or

(3) An operating limitation is reached.
