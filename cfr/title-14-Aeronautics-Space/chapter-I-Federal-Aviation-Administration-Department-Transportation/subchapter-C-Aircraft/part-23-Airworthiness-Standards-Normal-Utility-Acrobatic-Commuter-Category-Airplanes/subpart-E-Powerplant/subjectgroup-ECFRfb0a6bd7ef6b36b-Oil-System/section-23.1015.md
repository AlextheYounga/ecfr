##### § 23.1015 Oil tank tests. #####

Each oil tank must be tested under § 23.965, except that -

(a) The applied pressure must be five p.s.i. for the tank construction instead of the pressures specified in § 23.965(a);

(b) For a tank with a nonmetallic liner the test fluid must be oil rather than fuel as specified in § 23.965(d), and the slosh test on a specimen liner must be conducted with the oil at 250 °F.; and
