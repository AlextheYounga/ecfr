##### ยง 23.1121 General. #####

For powerplant and auxiliary power unit installations, the following apply -

(a) Each exhaust system must ensure safe disposal of exhaust gases without fire hazard or carbon monoxide contamination in any personnel compartment.

(b) Each exhaust system part with a surface hot enough to ignite flammable fluids or vapors must be located or shielded so that leakage from any system carrying flammable fluids or vapors will not result in a fire caused by impingement of the fluids or vapors on any part of the exhaust system including shields for the exhaust system.

(c) Each exhaust system must be separated by fireproof shields from adjacent flammable parts of the airplane that are outside of the engine and auxiliary power unit compartments.

(d) No exhaust gases may discharge dangerously near any fuel or oil system drain.

(e) No exhaust gases may be discharged where they will cause a glare seriously affecting pilot vision at night.

(f) Each exhaust system component must be ventilated to prevent points of excessively high temperature.

(g) If significant traps exist, each turbine engine and auxiliary power unit exhaust system must have drains discharging clear of the airplane, in any normal ground and flight attitude, to prevent fuel accumulation after the failure of an attempted engine or auxiliary power unit start.

(h) Each exhaust heat exchanger must incorporate means to prevent blockage of the exhaust port after any internal heat exchanger failure.

(i) For the purpose of compliance with ยง 23.603, the failure of any part of the exhaust system will be considered to adversely affect safety.
