##### ยง 23.969 Fuel tank expansion space. #####

Each fuel tank must have an expansion space of not less than two percent of the tank capacity, unless the tank vent discharges clear of the airplane (in which case no expansion space is required). It must be impossible to fill the expansion space inadvertently with the airplane in the normal ground attitude.
