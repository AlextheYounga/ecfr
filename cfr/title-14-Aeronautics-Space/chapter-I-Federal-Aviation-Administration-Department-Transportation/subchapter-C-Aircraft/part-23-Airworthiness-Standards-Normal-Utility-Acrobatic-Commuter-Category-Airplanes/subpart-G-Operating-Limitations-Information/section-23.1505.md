##### § 23.1505 Airspeed limitations. #####

(a) The never-exceed speed *V*NE must be established so that it is -

(1) Not less than 0.9 times the minimum value of *V*D allowed under § 23.335; and

(2) Not more than the lesser of -

(i) 0.9 *V*D established under § 23.335; or

(ii) 0.9 times the maximum speed shown under § 23.251.

(b) The maximum structural cruising speed *V*NO must be established so that it is -

(1) Not less than the minimum value of *V*C allowed under § 23.335; and

(2) Not more than the lesser of -

(i) *V*C established under § 23.335; or

(ii) 0.89 *V*NE established under paragraph (a) of this section.

(c)(1) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section do not apply to turbine airplanes or to airplanes for which a design diving speed VD/MD is established under § 23.335(b)(4). For those airplanes, a maximum operating limit speed (VMO/MMO airspeed or Mach number, whichever is critical at a particular altitude) must be established as a speed that may not be deliberately exceeded in any regime of flight (climb, cruise, or descent) unless a higher speed is authorized for flight test or pilot training operations.

(2) VMO/MMO must be established so that it is not greater than the design cruising speed VC/MC and so that it is sufficiently below VD/MD, or VDF/MDF for jets, and the maximum speed shown under § 23.251 to make it highly improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in operations.

(3) The speed margin between VMO/MMO and VD/MD, or VDF/MDF for jets, may not be less than that determined under § 23.335(b), or the speed margin found necessary in the flight tests conducted under § 23.253.
