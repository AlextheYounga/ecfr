(6) For seaplanes and amphibians, water handling procedures and the demonstrated wave height.

(b) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, for all single-engine airplanes, the procedures, speeds, and configuration(s) for a glide following engine failure, in accordance with § 23.71 and the subsequent forced landing, must be furnished.

(c) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, for all multiengine airplanes, the following information must be furnished:

(1) Procedures, speeds, and configuration(s) for making an approach and landing with one engine inoperative;

(2) Procedures, speeds, and configuration(s) for making a balked landing with one engine inoperative and the conditions under which a balked landing can be performed safely, or a warning against attempting a balked landing;

(3) The VSSE determined in § 23.149; and

(4) Procedures for restarting any engine in flight including the effects of altitude.

(d) In addition to paragraphs (a) and either (b) or (c) of this section, as appropriate, for all normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the following information must be furnished:

(1) Procedures, speeds, and configuration(s) for making a normal takeoff, in accordance with § 23.51 (a) and (b), and § 23.53 (a) and (b), and the subsequent climb, in accordance with § 23.65 and § 23.69(a).

(2) Procedures for abandoning a takeoff due to engine failure or other cause.

(e) In addition to paragraphs (a), (c), and (d) of this section, for all normal, utility, and acrobatic category multiengine airplanes, the information must include the following:

(1) Procedures and speeds for continuing a takeoff following engine failure and the conditions under which takeoff can safely be continued, or a warning against attempting to continue the takeoff.

(2) Procedures, speeds, and configurations for continuing a climb following engine failure, after takeoff, in accordance with § 23.67, or enroute, in accordance with § 23.69(b).

(f) In addition to paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, for normal, utility, and acrobatic category multiengine jets weighing over 6,000 pounds, and commuter category airplanes, the information must include the following:

(1) Procedures, speeds, and configuration(s) for making a normal takeoff.

(2) Procedures and speeds for carrying out an accelerate-stop in accordance with § 23.55.

(3) Procedures and speeds for continuing a takeoff following engine failure in accordance with § 23.59(a)(1) and for following the flight path determined under § 23.57 and § 23.61(a).

(g) For multiengine airplanes, information identifying each operating condition in which the fuel system independence prescribed in § 23.953 is necessary for safety must be furnished, together with instructions for placing the fuel system in a configuration used to show compliance with that section.

(h) For each airplane showing compliance with § 23.1353 (g)(2) or (g)(3), the operating procedures for disconnecting the battery from its charging source must be furnished.

(i) Information on the total quantity of usable fuel for each fuel tank, and the effect on the usable fuel quantity, as a result of a failure of any pump, must be furnished.

(j) Procedures for the safe operation of the airplane's systems and equipment, both in normal use and in the event of malfunction, must be furnished.
