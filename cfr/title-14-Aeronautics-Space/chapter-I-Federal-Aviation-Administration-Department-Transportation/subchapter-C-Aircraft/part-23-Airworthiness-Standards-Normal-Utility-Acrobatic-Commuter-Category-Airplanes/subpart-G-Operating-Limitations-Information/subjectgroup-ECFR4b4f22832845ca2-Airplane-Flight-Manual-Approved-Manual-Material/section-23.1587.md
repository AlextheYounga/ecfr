##### § 23.1587 Performance information. #####

Unless otherwise prescribed, performance information must be provided over the altitude and temperature ranges required by § 23.45(b).

(a) For all airplanes, the following information must be furnished -

(1) The stalling speeds VSO and VS1 with the landing gear and wing flaps retracted, determined at maximum weight under § 23.49, and the effect on these stalling speeds of angles of bank up to 60 degrees;

(2) The steady rate and gradient of climb with all engines operating, determined under § 23.69(a);

(3) The landing distance, determined under § 23.75 for each airport altitude and standard temperature, and the type of surface for which it is valid;

(4) The effect on landing distances of operation on other than smooth hard surfaces, when dry, determined under § 23.45(g); and

(5) The effect on landing distances of runway slope and 50 percent of the headwind component and 150 percent of the tailwind component.

(b) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, for all normal, utility, and acrobatic category reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, the steady angle of climb/descent, determined under § 23.77(a), must be furnished.

(c) In addition to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, if appropriate, for normal, utility, and acrobatic category airplanes, the following information must be furnished -

(1) The takeoff distance, determined under § 23.53 and the type of surface for which it is valid.

(2) The effect on takeoff distance of operation on other than smooth hard surfaces, when dry, determined under § 23.45(g);

(3) The effect on takeoff distance of runway slope and 50 percent of the headwind component and 150 percent of the tailwind component;

(4) For multiengine reciprocating engine-powered airplanes of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and multiengine turbine powered airplanes, the one-engine-inoperative takeoff climb/descent gradient, determined under § 23.66;

(5) For multiengine airplanes, the enroute rate and gradient of climb/descent with one engine inoperative, determined under § 23.69(b); and

(6) For single-engine airplanes, the glide performance determined under § 23.71.

(d) In addition to paragraph (a) of this section, for normal, utility, and acrobatic category multiengine jets weighing over 6,000 pounds, and commuter category airplanes, the following information must be furnished -

(1) The accelerate-stop distance determined under § 23.55;

(2) The takeoff distance determined under § 23.59(a);

(3) At the option of the applicant, the takeoff run determined under § 23.59(b);

(4) The effect on accelerate-stop distance, takeoff distance and, if determined, takeoff run, of operation on other than smooth hard surfaces, when dry, determined under § 23.45(g);

(5) The effect on accelerate-stop distance, takeoff distance, and if determined, takeoff run, of runway slope and 50 percent of the headwind component and 150 percent of the tailwind component;

(6) The net takeoff flight path determined under § 23.61(b);

(7) The enroute gradient of climb/descent with one engine inoperative, determined under § 23.69(b);

(8) The effect, on the net takeoff flight path and on the enroute gradient of climb/descent with one engine inoperative, of 50 percent of the headwind component and 150 percent of the tailwind component;

(9) Overweight landing performance information (determined by extrapolation and computed for the range of weights between the maximum landing and maximum takeoff weights) as follows -

(i) The maximum weight for each airport altitude and ambient temperature at which the airplane complies with the climb requirements of § 23.63(d)(2); and

(ii) The landing distance determined under § 23.75 for each airport altitude and standard temperature.

(10) The relationship between IAS and CAS determined in accordance with § 23.1323 (b) and (c).

(11) The altimeter system calibration required by § 23.1325(e).
