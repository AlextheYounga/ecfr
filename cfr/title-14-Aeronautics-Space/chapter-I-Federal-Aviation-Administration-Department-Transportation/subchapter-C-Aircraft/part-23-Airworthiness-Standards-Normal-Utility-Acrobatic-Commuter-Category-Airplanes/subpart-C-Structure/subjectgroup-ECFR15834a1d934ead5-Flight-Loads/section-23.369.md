##### § 23.369 Rear lift truss. #####

(a) If a rear lift truss is used, it must be designed to withstand conditions of reversed airflow at a design speed of -

V = 8.7 √(W/S) + 8.7 (knots), where W/S = wing loading at design maximum takeoff weight.

(b) Either aerodynamic data for the particular wing section used, or a value of *C*L equalling −0.8 with a chordwise distribution that is triangular between a peak at the trailing edge and zero at the leading edge, must be used.
