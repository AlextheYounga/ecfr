##### ยง 23.361 Engine torque. #####

(a) Each engine mount and its supporting structure must be designed for the effects of -

(1) A limit engine torque corresponding to takeoff power and propeller speed acting simultaneously with 75 percent of the limit loads from flight condition A of ยง 23.333(d);

(2) A limit engine torque corresponding to maximum continuous power and propeller speed acting simultaneously with the limit loads from flight condition A of ยง 23.333(d); and

(3) For turbopropeller installations, in addition to the conditions specified in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a limit engine torque corresponding to takeoff power and propeller speed, multiplied by a factor accounting for propeller control system malfunction, including quick feathering, acting simultaneously with lg level flight loads. In the absence of a rational analysis, a factor of 1.6 must be used.

(b) For turbine engine installations, the engine mounts and supporting structure must be designed to withstand each of the following:

(1) A limit engine torque load imposed by sudden engine stoppage due to malfunction or structural failure (such as compressor jamming).

(2) A limit engine torque load imposed by the maximum acceleration of the engine.

(c) The limit engine torque to be considered under paragraph (a) of this section must be obtained by multiplying the mean torque by a factor of -

(1) 1.25 for turbopropeller installations;

(2) 1.33 for engines with five or more cylinders; and

(3) Two, three, or four, for engines with four, three, or two cylinders, respectively.
