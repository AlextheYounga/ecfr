##### § 23.341 Gust loads factors. #####

(a) Each airplane must be designed to withstand loads on each lifting surface resulting from gusts specified in § 23.333(c).

(b) The gust load for a canard or tandem wing configuration must be computed using a rational analysis, or may be computed in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, provided that the resulting net loads are shown to be conservative with respect to the gust criteria of § 23.333(c).

(c) In the absence of a more rational analysis, the gust load factors must be computed as follows -

The wing lift curve slope *C*L per radian may be used when the gust load is applied to the wings only and the horizontal tail gust loads are treated as a separate condition.[Amdt. 23-7, 34 FR 13088, Aug. 13, 1969, as amended by Amdt. 23-42, 56 FR 352, Jan. 3, 1991; Amdt. 23-48, 61 FR 5144, Feb. 9, 1996]
