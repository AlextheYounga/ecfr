##### § 23.343 Design fuel loads. #####

(a) The disposable load combinations must include each fuel load in the range from zero fuel to the selected maximum fuel load.

(b) If fuel is carried in the wings, the maximum allowable weight of the airplane without any fuel in the wing tank(s) must be established as “maximum zero wing fuel weight,” if it is less than the maximum weight.

(c) For commuter category airplanes, a structural reserve fuel condition, not exceeding fuel necessary for 45 minutes of operation at maximum continuous power, may be selected. If a structural reserve fuel condition is selected, it must be used as the minimum fuel weight condition for showing compliance with the flight load requirements prescribed in this part and -

(1) The structure must be designed to withstand a condition of zero fuel in the wing at limit loads corresponding to:

(i) Ninety percent of the maneuvering load factors defined in § 23.337, and

(ii) Gust velocities equal to 85 percent of the values prescribed in § 23.333(c).

(2) The fatigue evaluation of the structure must account for any increase in operating stresses resulting from the design condition of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

(3) The flutter, deformation, and vibration requirements must also be met with zero fuel in the wings.
