##### § 23.427 Unsymmetrical loads. #####

(a) Horizontal surfaces other than main wing and their supporting structure must be designed for unsymmetrical loads arising from yawing and slipstream effects, in combination with the loads prescribed for the flight conditions set forth in §§ 23.421 through 23.425.

(b) In the absence of more rational data for airplanes that are conventional in regard to location of engines, wings, horizontal surfaces other than main wing, and fuselage shape:

(1) 100 percent of the maximum loading from the symmetrical flight conditions may be assumed on the surface on one side of the plane of symmetry; and

(2) The following percentage of that loading must be applied to the opposite side:

Percent = 100 − 10 (n − 1), where n is the specified positive maneuvering load factor, but this value may not be more than 80 percent.

(c) For airplanes that are not conventional (such as airplanes with horizontal surfaces other than main wing having appreciable dihedral or supported by the vertical tail surfaces) the surfaces and supporting structures must be designed for combined vertical and horizontal surface loads resulting from each prescribed flight condition taken separately.
