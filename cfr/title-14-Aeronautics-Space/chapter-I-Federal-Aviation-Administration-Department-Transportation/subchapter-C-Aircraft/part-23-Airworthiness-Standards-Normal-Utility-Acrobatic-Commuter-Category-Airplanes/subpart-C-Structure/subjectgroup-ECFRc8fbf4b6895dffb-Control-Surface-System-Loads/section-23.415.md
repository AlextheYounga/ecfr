##### § 23.415 Ground gust conditions. #####

(a) The control system must be investigated as follows for control surface loads due to ground gusts and taxiing downwind:

(1) If an investigation of the control system for ground gust loads is not required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but the applicant elects to design a part of the control system of these loads, these loads need only be carried from control surface horns through the nearest stops or gust locks and their supporting structures.

(2) If pilot forces less than the minimums specified in § 23.397(b) are used for design, the effects of surface loads due to ground gusts and taxiing downwind must be investigated for the entire control system according to the formula:

H = K c S qwhere -H = limit hinge moment (ft.-lbs.);c = mean chord of the control surface aft of the hinge line (ft.);S = area of control surface aft of the hinge line (sq. ft.);q = dynamic pressure (p.s.f.) based on a design speed not less than 14.6 √(W/S) + 14.6 (f.p.s.) where W/S = wing loading at design maximum weight, except that the design speed need not exceed 88 (f.p.s.);K = limit hinge moment factor for ground gusts derived in paragraph (b) of this section. (For ailerons and elevators, a positive value of K indicates a moment tending to depress the surface and a negative value of K indicates a moment tending to raise the surface).

(b) The limit hinge moment factor *K* for ground gusts must be derived as follows:

|  Surface   |  K  |                         Position of controls                          |
|------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
|(a) Aileron |0.75 |             Control column locked lashed in mid-position.             |
|(b) Aileron |±0.50|Ailerons at full throw; + moment on one aileron, − moment on the other.|
|(c) Elevator|±0.75|                       (c) Elevator full up (−).                       |
|(d) Elevator|     |                      (d) Elevator full down (+).                      |
| (e) Rudder |±0.75|                        (e) Rudder in neutral.                         |
| (f) Rudder |     |                       (f) Rudder at full throw.                       |

(c) At all weights between the empty weight and the maximum weight declared for tie-down stated in the appropriate manual, any declared tie-down points and surrounding structure, control system, surfaces and associated gust locks, must be designed to withstand the limit load conditions that exist when the airplane is tied down and that result from wind speeds of up to 65 knots horizontally from any direction.
