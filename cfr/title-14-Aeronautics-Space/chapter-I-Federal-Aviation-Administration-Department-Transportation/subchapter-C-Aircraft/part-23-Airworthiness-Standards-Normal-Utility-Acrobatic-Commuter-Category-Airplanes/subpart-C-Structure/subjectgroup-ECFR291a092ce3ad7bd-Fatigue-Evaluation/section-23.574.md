##### ยง 23.574 Metallic damage tolerance and fatigue evaluation of commuter category airplanes. #####

For commuter category airplanes -

(a) *Metallic damage tolerance.* An evaluation of the strength, detail design, and fabrication must show that catastrophic failure due to fatigue, corrosion, defects, or damage will be avoided throughout the operational life of the airplane. This evaluation must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of ยง 23.573, except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, for each part of the structure that could contribute to a catastrophic failure.

(b) *Fatigue (safe-life) evaluation.* Compliance with the damage tolerance requirements of paragraph (a) of this section is not required if the applicant establishes that the application of those requirements is impractical for a particular structure. This structure must be shown, by analysis supported by test evidence, to be able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected during its service life without detectable cracks. Appropriate safe-life scatter factors must be applied.
