##### ยง 23.441 Maneuvering loads. #####

(a) At speeds up to *V*A, the vertical surfaces must be designed to withstand the following conditions. In computing the loads, the yawing velocity may be assumed to be zero:

(1) With the airplane in unaccelerated flight at zero yaw, it is assumed that the rudder control is suddenly displaced to the maximum deflection, as limited by the control stops or by limit pilot forces.

(2) With the rudder deflected as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, it is assumed that the airplane yaws to the overswing sideslip angle. In lieu of a rational analysis, an overswing angle equal to 1.5 times the static sideslip angle of paragraph (a)(3) of this section may be assumed.

(3) A yaw angle of 15 degrees with the rudder control maintained in the neutral position (except as limited by pilot strength).

(b) For commuter category airplanes, the loads imposed by the following additional maneuver must be substantiated at speeds from VA to VD/MD. When computing the tail loads -

(1) The airplane must be yawed to the largest attainable steady state sideslip angle, with the rudder at maximum deflection caused by any one of the following:

(i) Control surface stops;

(ii) Maximum available booster effort;

(iii) Maximum pilot rudder force as shown below:

(2) The rudder must be suddenly displaced from the maximum deflection to the neutral position.

(c) The yaw angles specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section may be reduced if the yaw angle chosen for a particular speed cannot be exceeded in -

(1) Steady slip conditions;

(2) Uncoordinated rolls from steep banks; or

(3) Sudden failure of the critical engine with delayed corrective action.
