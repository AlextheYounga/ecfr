##### § 23.445 Outboard fins or winglets. #####

(a) If outboard fins or winglets are included on the horizontal surfaces or wings, the horizontal surfaces or wings must be designed for their maximum load in combination with loads induced by the fins or winglets and moments or forces exerted on the horizontal surfaces or wings by the fins or winglets.

(b) If outboard fins or winglets extend above and below the horizontal surface, the critical vertical surface loading (the load per unit area as determined under §§ 23.441 and 23.443) must be applied to -

(1) The part of the vertical surfaces above the horizontal surface with 80 percent of that loading applied to the part below the horizontal surface; and

(2) The part of the vertical surfaces below the horizontal surface with 80 percent of that loading applied to the part above the horizontal surface.

(c) The end plate effects of outboard fins or winglets must be taken into account in applying the yawing conditions of §§ 23.441 and 23.443 to the vertical surfaces in paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) When rational methods are used for computing loads, the maneuvering loads of § 23.441 on the vertical surfaces and the one-g horizontal surface load, including induced loads on the horizontal surface and moments or forces exerted on the horizontal surfaces by the vertical surfaces, must be applied simultaneously for the structural loading condition.
