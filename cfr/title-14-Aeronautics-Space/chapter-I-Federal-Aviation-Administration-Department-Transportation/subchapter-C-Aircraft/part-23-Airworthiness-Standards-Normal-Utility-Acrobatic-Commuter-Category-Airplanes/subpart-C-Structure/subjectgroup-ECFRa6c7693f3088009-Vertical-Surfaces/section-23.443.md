##### § 23.443 Gust loads. #####

(a) Vertical surfaces must be designed to withstand, in unaccelerated flight at speed *V*C, lateral gusts of the values prescribed for *V*C in § 23.333(c).

(b) In addition, for commuter category airplanes, the airplane is assumed to encounter derived gusts normal to the plane of symmetry while in unaccelerated flight at VB, VC, VD, and VF. The derived gusts and airplane speeds corresponding to these conditions, as determined by §§ 23.341 and 23.345, must be investigated. The shape of the gust must be as specified in § 23.333(c)(2)(i).

(c) In the absence of a more rational analysis, the gust load must be computed as follows:
