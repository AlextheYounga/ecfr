##### ยง 23.455 Ailerons. #####

(a) The ailerons must be designed for the loads to which they are subjected -

(1) In the neutral position during symmetrical flight conditions; and

(2) By the following deflections (except as limited by pilot effort), during unsymmetrical flight conditions:

(i) Sudden maximum displacement of the aileron control at *V*A. Suitable allowance may be made for control system deflections.

(ii) Sufficient deflection at *V*C, where *V*C is more than *V*A, to produce a rate of roll not less than obtained in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

(iii) Sufficient deflection at *V*D to produce a rate of roll not less than one-third of that obtained in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section.

(b) [Reserved]
