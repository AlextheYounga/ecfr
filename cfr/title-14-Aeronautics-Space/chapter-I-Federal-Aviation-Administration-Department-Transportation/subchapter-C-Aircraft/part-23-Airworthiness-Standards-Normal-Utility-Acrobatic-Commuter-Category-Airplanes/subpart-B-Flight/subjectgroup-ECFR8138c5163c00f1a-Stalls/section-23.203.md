##### ยง 23.203 Turning flight and accelerated turning stalls. #####

Turning flight and accelerated turning stalls must be demonstrated in tests as follows:

(a) Establish and maintain a coordinated turn in a 30 degree bank. Reduce speed by steadily and progressively tightening the turn with the elevator until the airplane is stalled, as defined in ยง 23.201(b). The rate of speed reduction must be constant, and -

(1) For a turning flight stall, may not exceed one knot per second; and

(2) For an accelerated turning stall, be 3 to 5 knots per second with steadily increasing normal acceleration.

(b) After the airplane has stalled, as defined in ยง 23.201(b), it must be possible to regain wings level flight by normal use of the flight controls, but without increasing power and without -

(1) Excessive loss of altitude;

(2) Undue pitchup;

(3) Uncontrollable tendency to spin;

(4) Exceeding a bank angle of 60 degrees in the original direction of the turn or 30 degrees in the opposite direction in the case of turning flight stalls;

(5) Exceeding a bank angle of 90 degrees in the original direction of the turn or 60 degrees in the opposite direction in the case of accelerated turning stalls; and

(6) Exceeding the maximum permissible speed or allowable limit load factor.

(c) Compliance with the requirements of this section must be shown under the following conditions:

(1) *Wings flaps:* Retracted, fully extended, and each intermediate normal operating position as appropriate for the phase of flight.

(2) *Landing gear:* Retracted and extended as appropriate for the altitude.

(3) *Cowl flaps:* Appropriate to configuration.

(4) *Spoilers/speedbrakes:* Retracted and extended unless they have no measureable effect at low speeds.

(5) *Power:*

(i) Power/Thrust off; and

(ii) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes: 75 percent of maximum continuous power. However, if the power-to-weight ratio at 75 percent of maximum continuous power results in nose-high attitudes exceeding 30 degrees, the test may be carried out with the power required for level flight in the landing configuration at maximum landing weight and a speed of 1.4 VSO, except that the power may not be less than 50 percent of maximum continuous power; or

(iii) For turbine engine powered airplanes: The maximum engine thrust, except that it need not exceed the thrust necessary to maintain level flight at 1.5 VS1 (where VS1 corresponds to the stalling speed with flaps in the approach position, the landing gear retracted, and maximum landing weight).

(6) *Trim:* The airplane trimmed at 1.5 VS1.

(7) *Propeller:* Full increase rpm position for the power off condition.
