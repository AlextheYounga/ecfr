##### ยง 23.177 Static directional and lateral stability. #####

(a)(1) The static directional stability, as shown by the tendency to recover from a wings level sideslip with the rudder free, must be positive for any landing gear and flap position appropriate to the takeoff, climb, cruise, approach, and landing configurations. This must be shown with symmetrical power up to maximum continuous power, and at speeds from 1.2 VS1 up to VFE, VLE, VNO, VFC/MFC, whichever is appropriate.

(2) The angle of sideslip for these tests must be appropriate to the type of airplane. The rudder pedal force must not reverse at larger angles of sideslip, up to that at which full rudder is used or a control force limit in ยง 23.143 is reached, whichever occurs first, and at speeds from 1.2 VS1 to VO.

(b)(1) The static lateral stability, as shown by the tendency to raise the low wing in a sideslip with the aileron controls free, may not be negative for any landing gear and flap position appropriate to the takeoff, climb, cruise, approach, and landing configurations. This must be shown with symmetrical power from idle up to 75 percent of maximum continuous power at speeds from 1.2 VS1 in the takeoff configuration(s) and at speeds from 1.3 VS1 in other configurations, up to the maximum allowable airspeed for the configuration being investigated (VFE, VLE, VNO, VFC/MFC, whichever is appropriate) in the takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, and approach configurations. For the landing configuration, the power must be that necessary to maintain a 3-degree angle of descent in coordinated flight.

(2) The static lateral stability may not be negative at 1.2 VS1 in the takeoff configuration, or at 1.3 VS1 in other configurations.

(3) The angel of sideslip for these tests must be appropriate to the type of airplane, but in no case may the constant heading sideslip angle be less than that obtainable with a 10 degree bank or, if less, the maximum bank angle obtainable with full rudder deflection or 150 pound rudder force.

(c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to acrobatic category airplanes certificated for inverted flight.

(d)(1) In straight, steady slips at 1.2 VS1 for any landing gear and flap position appropriate to the takeoff, climb, cruise, approach, and landing configurations, and for any symmetrical power conditions up to 50 percent of maximum continuous power, the aileron and rudder control movements and forces must increase steadily, but not necessarily in constant proportion, as the angle of sideslip is increased up to the maximum appropriate to the type of airplane.

(2) At larger slip angles, up to the angle at which the full rudder or aileron control is used or a control force limit contained in ยง 23.143 is reached, the aileron and rudder control movements and forces may not reverse as the angle of sideslip is increased.

(3) Rapid entry into, and recovery from, a maximum sideslip considered appropriate for the airplane may not result in uncontrollable flight characteristics.
