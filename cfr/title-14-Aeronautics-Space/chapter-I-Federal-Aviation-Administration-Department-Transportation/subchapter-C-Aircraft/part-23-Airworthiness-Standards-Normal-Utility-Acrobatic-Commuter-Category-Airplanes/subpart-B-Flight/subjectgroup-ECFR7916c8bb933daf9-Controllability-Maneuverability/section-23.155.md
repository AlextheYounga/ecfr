##### ยง 23.155 Elevator control force in maneuvers. #####

(a) The elevator control force needed to achieve the positive limit maneuvering load factor may not be less than:

(1) For wheel controls, W/100 (where W is the maximum weight) or 20 pounds, whichever is greater, except that it need not be greater than 50 pounds; or

(2) For stick controls, W/140 (where W is the maximum weight) or 15 pounds, whichever is greater, except that it need not be greater than 35 pounds.

(b) The requirement of paragraph (a) of this section must be met at 75 percent of maximum continuous power for reciprocating engines, or the maximum continuous power for turbine engines, and with the wing flaps and landing gear retracted -

(1) In a turn, with the trim setting used for wings level flight at VO; and

(2) In a turn with the trim setting used for the maximum wings level flight speed, except that the speed may not exceed VNE or VMO/MMO, whichever is appropriate.

(c) There must be no excessive decrease in the gradient of the curve of stick force versus maneuvering load factor with increasing load factor.
