##### ยง 23.251 Vibration and buffeting. #####

(a) There must be no vibration or buffeting severe enough to result in structural damage, and each part of the airplane must be free from excessive vibration, under any appropriate speed and power conditions up to VD/MD, or VDF/MDF for turbojets. In addition, there must be no buffeting in any normal flight condition, including configuration changes during cruise, severe enough to interfere with the satisfactory control of the airplane or cause excessive fatigue to the flight crew. Stall warning buffeting within these limits is allowable.

(b) There must be no perceptible buffeting condition in the cruise configuration in straight flight at any speed up to VMO/MMO, except stall buffeting, which is allowable.

(c) For airplanes with MD greater than M 0.6 or a maximum operating altitude greater than 25,000 feet, the positive maneuvering load factors at which the onset of perceptible buffeting occurs must be determined with the airplane in the cruise configuration for the ranges of airspeed or Mach number, weight, and altitude for which the airplane is to be certificated. The envelopes of load factor, speed, altitude, and weight must provide a sufficient range of speeds and load factors for normal operations. Probable inadvertent excursions beyond the boundaries of the buffet onset envelopes may not result in unsafe conditions.
