##### ยง 23.55 Accelerate-stop distance. #####

For normal, utility, and acrobatic category multiengine jets of more than 6,000 pounds maximum weight and commuter category airplanes, the accelerate-stop distance must be determined as follows:

(a) The accelerate-stop distance is the sum of the distances necessary to -

(1) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start to VEF with all engines operating;

(2) Accelerate the airplane from VEF to V1, assuming the critical engine fails at VEF; and

(3) Come to a full stop from the point at which V1 is reached.

(b) Means other than wheel brakes may be used to determine the accelerate-stop distances if that means -

(1) Is safe and reliable;

(2) Is used so that consistent results can be expected under normal operating conditions; and

(3) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the airplane.
