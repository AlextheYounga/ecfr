##### ยง 23.33 Propeller speed and pitch limits. #####

(a) *General.* The propeller speed and pitch must be limited to values that will assure safe operation under normal operating conditions.

(b) *Propellers not controllable in flight.* For each propeller whose pitch cannot be controlled in flight -

(1) During takeoff and initial climb at the all engine(s) operating climb speed specified in ยง 23.65, the propeller must limit the engine r.p.m., at full throttle or at maximum allowable takeoff manifold pressure, to a speed not greater than the maximum allowable takeoff r.p.m.; and

(2) During a closed throttle glide, at VNE, the propeller may not cause an engine speed above 110 percent of maximum continuous speed.

(c) *Controllable pitch propellers without constant speed controls.* Each propeller that can be controlled in flight, but that does not have constant speed controls, must have a means to limit the pitch range so that -

(1) The lowest possible pitch allows compliance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section; and

(2) The highest possible pitch allows compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

(d) *Controllable pitch propellers with constant speed controls.* Each controllable pitch propeller with constant speed controls must have -

(1) With the governor in operation, a means at the governor to limit the maximum engine speed to the maximum allowable takeoff r.p.m.; and

(2) With the governor inoperative, the propeller blades at the lowest possible pitch, with takeoff power, the airplane stationary, and no wind, either -

(i) A means to limit the maximum engine speed to 103 percent of the maximum allowable takeoff r.p.m., or

(ii) For an engine with an approved overspeed, a means to limit the maximum engine and propeller speed to not more than the maximum approved overspeed.
