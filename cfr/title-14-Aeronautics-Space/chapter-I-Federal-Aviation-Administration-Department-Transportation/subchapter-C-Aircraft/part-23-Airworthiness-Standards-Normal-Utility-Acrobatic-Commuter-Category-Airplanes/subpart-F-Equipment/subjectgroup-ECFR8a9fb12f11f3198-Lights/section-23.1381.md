##### ยง 23.1381 Instrument lights. #####

The instrument lights must -

(a) Make each instrument and control easily readable and discernible;

(b) Be installed so that their direct rays, and rays reflected from the windshield or other surface, are shielded from the pilot's eyes; and

(c) Have enough distance or insulating material between current carrying parts and the housing so that vibration in flight will not cause shorting.

A cabin dome light is not an instrument light.
