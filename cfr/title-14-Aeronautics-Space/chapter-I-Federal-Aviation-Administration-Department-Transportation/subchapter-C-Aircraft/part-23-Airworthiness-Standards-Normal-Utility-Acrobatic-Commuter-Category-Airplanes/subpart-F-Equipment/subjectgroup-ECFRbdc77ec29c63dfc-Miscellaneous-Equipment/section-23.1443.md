##### § 23.1443 Minimum mass flow of supplemental oxygen. #####

(a) If the airplane is to be certified above 41,000 feet, a continuous flow oxygen system must be provided for each passenger.

(b) If continuous flow oxygen equipment is installed, an applicant must show compliance with the requirements of either paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) or paragraph (b)(3) of this section:

(1) For each passenger, the minimum mass flow of supplemental oxygen required at various cabin pressure altitudes may not be less than the flow required to maintain, during inspiration and while using the oxygen equipment (including masks) provided, the following mean tracheal oxygen partial pressures:

(i) At cabin pressure altitudes above 10,000 feet up to and including 18,500 feet, a mean tracheal oxygen partial pressure of 100mm Hg when breathing 15 liters per minute, Body Temperature, Pressure, Saturated (BTPS) and with a tidal volume of 700cc with a constant time interval between respirations.

(ii) At cabin pressure altitudes above 18,500 feet up to and including 40,000 feet, a mean tracheal oxygen partial pressure of 83.8mm Hg when breathing 30 liters per minute, BTPS, and with a tidal volume of 1,100cc with a constant time interval between respirations.

(2) For each flight crewmember, the minimum mass flow may not be less than the flow required to maintain, during inspiration, a mean tracheal oxygen partial pressure of 149mm Hg when breathing 15 liters per minute, BTPS, and with a maximum tidal volume of 700cc with a constant time interval between respirations.

(3) The minimum mass flow of supplemental oxygen supplied for each user must be at a rate not less than that shown in the following figure for each altitude up to and including the maximum operating altitude of the airplane.

(c) If demand equipment is installed for use by flight crewmembers, the minimum mass flow of supplemental oxygen required for each flight crewmember may not be less than the flow required to maintain, during inspiration, a mean tracheal oxygen partial pressure of 122mm Hg up to and including a cabin pressure altitude of 35,000 feet, and 95 percent oxygen between cabin pressure altitudes of 35,000 and 40,000 feet, when breathing 20 liters per minutes BTPS. In addition, there must be means to allow the flight crew to use undiluted oxygen at their discretion.

(d) If first-aid oxygen equipment is installed, the minimum mass flow of oxygen to each user may not be less than 4 liters per minute, STPD. However, there may be a means to decrease this flow to not less than 2 liters per minute, STPD, at any cabin altitude. The quantity of oxygen required is based upon an average flow rate of 3 liters per minute per person for whom first-aid oxygen is required.

(e) As used in this section:

(1) BTPS means Body Temperature, and Pressure, Saturated (which is 37 °C, and the ambient pressure to which the body is exposed, minus 47mm Hg, which is the tracheal pressure displaced by water vapor pressure when the breathed air becomes saturated with water vapor at 37 °C).

(2) STPD means Standard, Temperature, and Pressure, Dry (which is 0 °C at 760mm Hg with no water vapor).
