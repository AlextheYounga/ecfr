##### § 23.1431 Electronic equipment. #####

(a) In showing compliance with § 23.1309(a), (b), and (c) with respect to radio and electronic equipment and their installations, critical environmental conditions must be considered.

(b) Radio and electronic equipment, controls, and wiring must be installed so that operation of any unit or system of units will not adversely affect the simultaneous operation of any other radio or electronic unit, or system of units, required by this chapter.

(c) For those airplanes required to have more than one flightcrew member, or whose operation will require more than one flightcrew member, the cockpit must be evaluated to determine if the flightcrew members, when seated at their duty station, can converse without difficulty under the actual cockpit noise conditions when the airplane is being operated. If the airplane design includes provision for the use of communication headsets, the evaluation must also consider conditions where headsets are being used. If the evaluation shows conditions under which it will be difficult to converse, an intercommunication system must be provided.

(d) If installed communication equipment includes transmitter “off-on” switching, that switching means must be designed to return from the “transmit” to the “off” position when it is released and ensure that the transmitter will return to the off (non transmitting) state.

(e) If provisions for the use of communication headsets are provided, it must be demonstrated that the flightcrew members will receive all aural warnings under the actual cockpit noise conditions when the airplane is being operated when any headset is being used.
