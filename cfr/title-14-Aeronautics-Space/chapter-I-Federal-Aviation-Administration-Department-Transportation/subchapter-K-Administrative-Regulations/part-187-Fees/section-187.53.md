##### ยง 187.53 Calculation of overflight fees. #####

(a) The FAA assesses a total fee that is the sum of the Enroute and Oceanic calculated fees.

(1) *Enroute fee.* The Enroute fee is calculated by multiplying the Enroute rate in paragraph (c) of this section by the total number of nautical miles flown through each segment of Enroute airspace divided by 100 (because the Enroute rate is expressed per 100 nautical miles).

(2) *Oceanic fee.* The Oceanic fee is calculated by multiplying the Oceanic rate in paragraph (c) of this section by the total number of nautical miles flown through each segment of Oceanic airspace divided by 100 (because the Oceanic rate is expressed per 100 nautical miles).

(b) Distance flown through each segment of Enroute or Oceanic airspace is based on the great circle distance (GCD) from the point of entry into U.S.-controlled airspace to the point of exit from U.S.-controlled airspace based on FAA flight data. Where actual entry and exit points are not available, the FAA will use the best available flight data to calculate the entry and exit points.

(c) The rate for each 100 nautical miles flown through Enroute or Oceanic airspace is:

|           Time period            |Enroute rate|Oceanic rate|
|----------------------------------|------------|------------|
|January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018|   58.45    |   23.15    |
|January 1,2018 to January 1, 2019 |   60.07    |   24.77    |
|    January 1, 2019 and Beyond    |   61.75    |   26.51    |

(d) The formula for the total overflight fee is:

Rij = E\*DEij/100 + O\*DOij/100Where:Rij = the total fee charged to aircraft flying between entry point i and exit point j.DEij = total distance flown through each segment of Enroute airspace between entry point i and exit point j.DOij = total distance flown through each segment of Oceanic airspace between entry point i and exit point j.E and O = the Enroute and Oceanic rates, respectively, set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.

(e) The FAA will review the rates described in this section at least once every 2 years and will adjust them to reflect the current costs and volume of the services provided.
