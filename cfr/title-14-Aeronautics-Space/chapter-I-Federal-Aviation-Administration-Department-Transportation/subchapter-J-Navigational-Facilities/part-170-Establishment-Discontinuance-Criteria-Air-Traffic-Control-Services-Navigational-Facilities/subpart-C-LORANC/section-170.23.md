##### § 170.23 LORAN-C establishment criteria. #####

(a) The criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section, along with general facility and navigational aid establishment requirements, must be met before a runway can be eligible for LORAN-C approach.

(1) A runway must have landing surfaces judged adequate by the FAA to accommodate aircraft expected to use the approach and meet all FAA-required airport design criteria for nonprecision runways.

(2) A runway must be found acceptable for instrument flight rules operations as a result of an airport airspace analysis conducted in accordance with the current FAA regulations and provisions.

(3) The LORAN-C signal must be of sufficient quality and accuracy to pass an FAA flight inspection.

(4) It must be possible to remove, mark, or light all approach obstacles in accordance with FAA marking and lighting provisions.

(5) Appropriate weather information must be available.

(6) Air-to-ground communications must be available at the initial approach fix minimum altitude and at the missed approach altitude.

(b) A runway meets the establishment criteria for a LORAN-C approach when it satisfies paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(6) of this section and the estimated value of benefits associated with the LORAN-C approach equals or exceeds the estimated costs (benefit-cost ratio equals or exceeds one). As defined in § 170.3 of this part, the benefit-cost ratio is the ratio of the present value of the LORAN-C life-cycle benefits (PVB) to the present value of LORAN-C life-cycle costs (PVC):

PVB/PVC ≥1.0

(c) The criteria do not cover all situations that may arise and are not used as a sole determinant in denying or granting the establishment of non-precision LORAN-C approach for which there is a demonstrated operational or air traffic control requirement.
