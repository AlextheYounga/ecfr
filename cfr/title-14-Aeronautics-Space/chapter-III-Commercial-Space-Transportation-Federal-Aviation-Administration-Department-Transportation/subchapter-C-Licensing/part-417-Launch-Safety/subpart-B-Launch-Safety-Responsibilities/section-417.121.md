For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, any source of tracking data must satisfy the requirements of § 417.307(b).

(i) *Unguided suborbital rocket preflight operations.* For the launch of an unguided suborbital rocket, in addition to meeting the other requirements of this section, a launch operator must perform the preflight wind weighting and other preflight safety operations required by §§ 417.125, 417.233, and appendix C of this part.
