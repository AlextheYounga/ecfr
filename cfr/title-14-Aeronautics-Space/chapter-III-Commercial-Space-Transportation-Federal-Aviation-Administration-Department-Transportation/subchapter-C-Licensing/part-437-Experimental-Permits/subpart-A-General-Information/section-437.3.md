*Exclusion area* means an area, within an operating area, that a reusable suborbital rocket's instantaneous impact point may not traverse.

*Key flight-safety event* means a permitted flight activity that has an increased likelihood of causing a launch accident compared with other portions of flight.

*Operating area* means a three-dimensional region where permitted flights may take place.
