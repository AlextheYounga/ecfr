##### ยง 399.37 Joint fares. #####

There should be joint fares in all markets over all routings within the contiguous 48 states and the District of Columbia as follows:

(a) *Level.* The level shall not exceed the sum of the maximum local fares permitted by this subpart minus one tax-rounded coach ceiling terminal charge for each interline connection, and in any event shall not exceed the sum of the actual local fares.

(b) *Division.* Joint fares shall be divided according to the relative costs of the mileage flown by each carrier participating in the interline movement. However, where a joint fare is equal to the sum of the actual local fares, each carrier shall get the local fare as its share.
