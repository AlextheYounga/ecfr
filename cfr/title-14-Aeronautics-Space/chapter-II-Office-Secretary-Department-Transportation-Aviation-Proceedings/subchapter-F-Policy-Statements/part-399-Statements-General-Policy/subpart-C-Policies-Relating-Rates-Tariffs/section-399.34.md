<sup>1</sup> Cost inflation to July 1, 1977; 1.047 percent for Aloha, 1.026 for Hawaiian. The differing rates for the two carriers, having equivalent aircraft and duplicate route structures, is due primarily to a shift by Hawaiian to larger DC-9-50 aircraft starting in the fourth quarter of 1976.

<sup>2</sup> Passenger revenue divided by RPM's.

<sup>3</sup> Passenger yield at 12.35 percent return divided by actual passenger yield for the year ended March 1977.
