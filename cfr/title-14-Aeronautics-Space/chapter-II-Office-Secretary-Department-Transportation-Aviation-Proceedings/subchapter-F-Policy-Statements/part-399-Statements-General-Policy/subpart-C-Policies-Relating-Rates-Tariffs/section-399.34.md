Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 15947, Apr. 16, 2019.

For scheduled service within Hawaii, and within and between Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, certificated air carriers have the fare flexibility set forth in §§ 399.32 and 399.33, except that:

(a) Instead of the limits set forth in § 399.32(d), the upper limit of the zone for Puerto Rico/Virgin Islands is 30 percent above the SIFL, and for Hawaii is 30 percent above the SHFL; and

(b) The fare flexibility set forth in § 399.33(a) (first class) does not apply to service within Hawaii.

<sup>1</sup> Cost inflation to July 1, 1977; 1.047 percent for Aloha, 1.026 for Hawaiian. The differing rates for the two carriers, having equivalent aircraft and duplicate route structures, is due primarily to a shift by Hawaiian to larger DC-9-50 aircraft starting in the fourth quarter of 1976.

<sup>2</sup> Passenger revenue divided by RPM's.

<sup>3</sup> Passenger yield at 12.35 percent return divided by actual passenger yield for the year ended March 1977.
