##### ยง 399.44 Treatment of deferred Federal income taxes for rate purposes. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 15947, Apr. 16, 2019.

For rate-making purposes other than the determination of subsidy under section 406(b), it is the policy of the Board that Federal income tax expense should be based on the normal taxes that would be paid under the depreciation standards used for rate making, and that accumulated reserves for deferred taxes should be excluded from the recognized capitalization for rate-base purposes.
