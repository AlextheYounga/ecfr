##### ยง 399.83 Unfair or deceptive practice of air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent in orally confirming to prospective passenger reserved space on scheduled flights. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 15948, Apr. 16, 2019.

It is the policy of the Board to consider the practice of an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent, of stating to a prospective passenger by telephone or other means of communication that a reservation of space on a scheduled flight in air transportation is confirmed before a passenger has received a ticket specifying thereon his confirmed reserved space, to be an unfair or deceptive practice and an unfair method of competition in air transportation or the sale thereof within the meaning of section 411 of the Act, unless the tariff of the particular air carrier or foreign air carrier provides for confirmation of reserved space by the means so used.
