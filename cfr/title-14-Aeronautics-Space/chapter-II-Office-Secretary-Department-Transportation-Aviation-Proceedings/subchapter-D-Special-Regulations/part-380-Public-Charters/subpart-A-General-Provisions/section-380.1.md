##### ยง 380.1 Applicability. #####

This part applies to Public Charter air transportation of passengers in interstate or foreign air transportation, whether furnished by direct air carriers or Public Charter operators. This part also relieves such charter operators from various provisions of subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (statute), formerly Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended, for the purpose of enabling them to provide Public Charters utilizing aircraft chartered from such direct air carriers. It also declines jurisdiction over foreign Public Charter operators operating foreign-originating Public Charters.
