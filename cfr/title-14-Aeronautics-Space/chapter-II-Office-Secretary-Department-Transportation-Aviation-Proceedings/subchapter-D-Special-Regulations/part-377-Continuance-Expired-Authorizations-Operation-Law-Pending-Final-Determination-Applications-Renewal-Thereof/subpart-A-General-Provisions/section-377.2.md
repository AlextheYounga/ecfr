The last sentence of 5 U.S.C. 558(c) provides: “When the licensee has made timely and sufficient application for a renewal or a new license in accordance with agency rules, a license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature does not expire until the application has been finally determined by the agency.”

(b) Nothing in this part prevents the Board from terminating at any time, in accordance with law, any authorization or any extension of an authorization.

(c) Nothing in this part constitutes a determination that any given authorization is a “license with reference to an activity of a continuing nature” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 558(c).
