Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 15936, Apr. 16, 2019.

(a) *Filing address, date of filing, hours.* (1) Documents required by any section of this part to be filed with the Department must be filed with Department of Transportation Dockets at the Department's offices in Washington, DC. Documents may be filed either on paper or by electronic means using the process set at the DOT Dockets Management System (DMS) internet website.

(2) Such documents will be deemed to be filed on the date on which they are actually received by the Department. Documents must be filed between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., eastern standard or daylight savings time, whichever is in effect in the District of Columbia at the time, Monday to Friday, inclusive, except on legal holidays. Electronic filings may be made at any time under the process set by the Department. Electronic filings that are received after the specified Dockets Facility hours shall be deemed to be constructively received on the next Dockets Facility business day.

(b) *Formal specifications of documents.* (1) Documents filed under this part must be on white paper not larger than 81/2 by 11 inches, including any tables, charts and other documents that may be included. Ink must be black to provide substantial contrast for scanning and photographic reproduction. Text must be double-spaced (except for footnotes and long quotations which may be single-spaced) using type not smaller than 12 point. The left margin must be at least 11/2 inches; all other margins must be at least 1 inch. The title page and first page must bear a clear date and all subsequent pages must bear a page number and abbreviated heading. In order to facilitate automated processing in document sheet feeders, documents of more than one page should be held together with removable metal clips or similar retainers. Original documents may not be bound in any form or include tabs, except in cases assigned by order to an Administrative Law Judge for hearing, in which case the filing requirements will be set by order. Section 302.35 contains additional requirements as to the contents and style of briefs.

(2) Papers may be reproduced by any duplicating process, provided all copies are clear and legible. Appropriate notes or other indications must be used, so that the existence of any matters shown in color on the original will be accurately indicated on all copies.

(c) *Number of copies.* Unless otherwise specified, an executed original, along with the number of true copies set forth below for each type of proceeding, must be filed with Department of Transportation Dockets. The copies filed need not be signed, but the name of the person signing the original document, as distinguished from the firm or organization he or she represents, must also be typed or printed on all copies below the space provided for signature. Electronic filers need only submit one copy of the document, which must conform to the submission requirements given in the electronic filing instructions at the specified DOT DMS internet website and in this part, as applicable.

(ii) Such document complies with each of the requirements of this paragraph and 302.7, and for those electronically filed, the requirements specified at the DOT DMS internet website, and is submitted as a formal application, complaint, petition, motion, answer, pleading, or similar paper rather than as a letter, telegram, or other informal written communication; *Provided, however,* That for good cause shown, pleadings of any public body or civic organization or comments concerning tariff agreements that have not been docketed, may be submitted in the form of a letter.
