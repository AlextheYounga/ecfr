##### ยง 303.06 Review of antitrust immunity. #####

The Assistant Secretary may initiate a proceeding to review any antitrust immunity previously conferred by the Civil Aeronautics Board or the Department in any section 412 transaction. The Assistant Secretary may terminate or modify such immunity if the Assistant Secretary finds after notice and hearing that the previously conferred immunity is not consistent with the provisions of section 414. In any proceeding to review such immunity, the proponents of the immunity will have the burden of justifying the continuation of previously conferred immunity under the provisions of section 414.
