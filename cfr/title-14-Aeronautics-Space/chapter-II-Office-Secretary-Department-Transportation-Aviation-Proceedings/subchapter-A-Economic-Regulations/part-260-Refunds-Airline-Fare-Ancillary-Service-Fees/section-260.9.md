##### ยง 260.9 Providing prompt refunds. #####

When a refund of a fare or a fee for an ancillary service, including a fee for lost or significantly delayed checked baggage, is due pursuant to this part, the refund must be issued promptly in the original form of payment (*i.e.,* money is returned to an individual using whatever payment method the individual used to make the original payment, such as a check, credit card, debit card, cash, or airline miles) unless the consumer agrees to receive the refunds in a different form of payment that is a cash equivalent as defined in ยง 260.2. Carriers may not retain a processing fee for issuing refunds that are due.
