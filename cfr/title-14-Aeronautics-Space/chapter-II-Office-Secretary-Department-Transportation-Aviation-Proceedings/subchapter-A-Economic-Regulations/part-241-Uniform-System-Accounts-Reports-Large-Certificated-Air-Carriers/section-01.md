This Uniform System of Accounts and Reports for Large Certificated Air Carriers is issued, prescribed and administered under the following provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (72 Stat. 731, 49 U.S.C. 1301):

General Powers

Sec. 204. (a) The Board is empowered to perform such acts, to conduct such investigations, to issue and amend such orders, and to make and amend such general or special rules, regulations, and procedure, pursuant to and consistent with the provisions of this Act, as it shall deem necessary to carry out the provisions of, and to exercise and perform its powers and duties under, this Act.

filing of reports

Sec. 407. (a) The Board is empowered to require annual, monthly, periodical, and special reports from any air carrier; to prescribe the manner and form in which such reports shall be made; and to require from any air carrier specific answers to all questions upon which the Board may deem information to be necessary. Such reports shall be under oath whenever the Board so requires. The Board may also require any air carrier to file with it a true copy of each or any contract, agreement, understanding, or arrangement, between such air carrier and any other carrier or person, in relation to any traffic affected by the provisions of this Act.

Disclosure of Stock Ownership

Sec. 407. (b) Each air carrier shall submit annually, and at such other times as the Board shall require, a list showing the names of each of its stockholders or members holding more than 5 per centum of the entire capital stock or capital, as the case may be, of such air carrier, together with the name of any person for whose account, if other than the holder, such stock is held; and a report setting forth a description of the shares of stock, or other interest, held by such air carrier, or for its account, in persons other than itself.

Form of Accounts

Sec. 407. (d) The Board shall prescribe the forms of any and all accounts, records, and memoranda to be kept by air carriers, including the accounts, records, and memoranda of the movement of traffic, as well as of the receipts and expenditures of money, and the length of time such accounts, records, and memoranda shall be preserved; and it shall be unlawful for air carriers to keep any accounts, records, or memoranda other than those prescribed or approved by the Board: *Provided,* That any air carrier may keep additional accounts, records, or memoranda if they do not impair the integrity of the accounts, records, or memoranda prescribed or approved by the Board and do not constitute an undue financial burden on such air carrier.

Inspection of Accounts and Property

Sec. 407. (e) The Board shall at all times have access to all lands, buildings, and equipment of any carrier and to all accounts, records, and memoranda, including all documents, papers, and correspondence, now or hereafter existing, and kept or required to be kept by air carriers; and it may employ special agents or auditors, who shall have authority under the orders of the Board to inspect and examine any and all such lands, buildings, equipment, accounts, records, and memoranda. The provisions of this section shall apply, to the extent found by the Board to be reasonably necessary for the administration of this Act, to persons having control over any air carrier, or affiliated with any air carrier within the meaning of section 5(8) of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended.

Classification

Sec. 416. (a) The Board may from time to time establish such just and reasonable classifications or groups of air carriers for the purposes of this title as the nature of the services performed by such air carriers shall require; and such just and reasonable rules and regulations, pursuant to and consistent with the provisions of this title, to be observed by each such class or group, as the Board finds necessary in the public interest.

Safety, Economic and Postal Offenses

Sec. 901. (a)(1) Any person who violates (A) any provision of Title III, IV, V, VI, VII, or XII of this Act, or any rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder, or under section 1002(i), or any term, condition or limitation of any permit or certificate issued under Title IV, or (B) any rule or regulation issued by the Postmaster General under this Act, shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $1,000 for each such violation. If such violation is a continuing one, each day of such violation shall constitute a separate offense: *Provided,* That this subsection shall not apply to members of the Armed Forces of the United States, or those civilian employees of the Department of Defense who are subject to the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, while engaged in the performance of their official duties; and the appropriate military authorities shall be responsible for taking any necessary disciplinary action with respect thereto and for making to the Administrator or Board, as appropriate, a timely report of any such action taken.

(2) Any such civil penalty may be compromised by the Administrator in the case of violations of Titles III, V, VI, or XII, or any rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder, or by the Board in the case of violations of Titles IV or VII, or any rule, regulation or order issued thereunder, or under section 1002(i), or any term, condition, or limitation of any permit or certificate issued under Title IV, or by the Postmaster General in the case of regulations issued by him. The amount of such penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States to the person charged.

Failure To File Reports; Falsification of Records

Sec. 902. (e) Any air carrier, or any officer, agent, employee, or representative thereof, who shall, knowingly and willfully, fail or refuse to make a report to the Board or Administrator as required by this Act, or to keep or preserve accounts, records, and memoranda in the form and manner prescribed or approved by the Board or Administrator, or shall, knowingly and willfully, falsify, mutilate, or alter any such report, account, record, or memorandum, or shall knowingly and willfully file any false report, account, record, or memorandum, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, be subject for each offense to a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $5,000.

Refusal To Testify

Sec. 902. (g) Any person who shall neglect or refuse to attend and testify, or to answer any lawful inquiry, or to produce books, papers, or documents, if in his power to do so, in obedience to the subpena or lawful requirement of the Board or Administrator, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $5,000, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.

Filing of Complaints Authorized

Sec. 1002. (a) Any person may file with the Administrator or the Board, as to matters within their respective jurisdictions, a complaint in writing with respect to anything done or omitted to be done by any person in contravention of any provisions of this Act, or of any requirement established pursuant thereto. If the person complained against shall not satisfy the complaint and there shall appear to be any reasonable ground for investigating the complaint, it shall be the duty of the Administrator or the Board to investigate the matters complained of. Whenever the Administrator or the Board is of the opinion that any complaint does not state facts which warrant an investigation or action, such complaint may be dismissed without hearing. In the case of complaints against a member of the Armed Forces of the United States acting in the performance of his official duties, the Administrator or the Board, as the case may be, shall refer the complaint to the Secretary of the department concerned for action. The Secretary shall, within ninety days after receiving such a complaint, inform the Administrator or the Board of his disposition of the complaint, including a report as to any corrective or disciplinary actions taken.

Investigations on Initiative of Administrator or Board

Sec. 1002. (b) The Administrator or Board, with respect to matters within their respective jurisdictions, is empowered at any time to institute an investigation, on their own initiative, in any case and as to any matter or thing within their respective jurisdictions, concerning which complaint is authorized to be made to or before the Administrator or Board by any provision of this Act, or concerning which any question may arise under any of the provisions of this Act, or relating to the enforcement of any of the provisions of this Act. The Administrator or the Board shall have the same power to proceed with any investigation instituted on their own motion as though it had been appealed to by complaint.

Entry or Orders for Compliance With Act

Sec. 1002. (c) If the Administrator or the Board finds, after notice and hearing, in any investigation instituted upon complaint or upon their own initiative, with respect to matters within their jurisdiction, that any person has failed to comply with any provision of this Act or any requirement established pursuant thereto, the Administrator or the Board shall issue an appropriate order to compel such person to comply therewith.
