(b) This schedule shall show the results of operations for six-month periods ending June 30 and December 31. Data reported in the “12 Months-to-Date” column shall represent for each individual item the sum of the amount reported in the “Current Period” column and the next previous six-month period.

(A) *Passengers.* Revenue generated from the transportation of passengers shall be included in this category.

(i) *Public Service Revenue.* This category shall include amounts of compensation paid to the carrier under 49 U.S.C 41733.

(1) “Flying Operations” shall include expenses incurred directly in the in-flight operation of aircraft and expenses incurred in the holding of aircraft and aircraft operation personnel in readiness for assignment to an in-flight status.

(2) “Maintenance” shall include all expenses which are specifically identifiable with the repair and upkeep of property and equipment used in the performance of air transportation.

(3) “General and Administrative” shall include that portion of all expenses of a general corporate nature and all other expenses not provided for elsewhere which are related to air transport operations either directly or indirectly.

This category shall also include the total interest expense incurred from all sources and shall be subdivided as follows:

(1) Interest Expense.

(2) Other Nonoperating (Net).

(f) All Group I and Group II air carriers shall report first class and coach passenger revenues as a combined total in Account 3901 Transport Revenues-Passenger, for both domestic and international entity operations. However, U.S. air carriers in any carrier group that elect to do so may continue to report first class and coach revenue data, if they consider such voluntary reporting to be less burdensome than changing their existing financial reporting system.

However, “through-put” and “in to plane” charges that cannot be identified or segregated from the cost of fuel shall remain a part of the cost of fuel as reported on this schedule.

(h) Each air carrier shall maintain records for each station showing the computation of fuel inventories and consumption for each fuel type. The periodic average cost method shall be used in computing fuel inventories and consumption. Under this method, an average unit cost for each fuel type shall be computed by dividing the total cost of fuel available (Beginning Inventory plus Purchases) by the total gallons available. The resulting unit cost shall then be used to determine the ending inventory and the total consumption costs to be reported on this schedule.

(i) Where amounts reported for a specific entity include other than Jet A fuel, a footnote shall be added indicating the number of gallons and applicable costs of such other fuel included in amounts reported for that entity.

(j) Where any adjustment(s) recorded on the books of the carrier results in a material distortion of the current month's schedule, carriers shall file a revised schedule P-12(a) for the month(s) affected.

Provisions governing the due dates for submitting the quarterly P schedules are contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section 22 of this part. Individual carrier fuel data withheld from public disclosure may be disclosed by the BTS to:
