##### § 291.45 BTS Schedule T-100, U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 15933, Apr. 16, 2019.

(a) Each section 41103 all-cargo air carrier shall file Schedule T-100, “U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market”.

(b) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly.

(1) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data for revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. First, the nonstop segment information which is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or flight number.

(2) *Joint-service operations.* The Department may authorize joint-service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.

(i) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any other traffic on the aircraft.

(ii) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director - Airline Information (fax no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).

(iii) *Operational control.* The air carrier in operational control of the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority) must report joint services.

(c) *Service classes.* (1) The statistical classifications are designed to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services are placed into service classes as follows:

|Code|           Type of service            |
|----|--------------------------------------|
| F  |      Scheduled Passenger/Cargo.      |
| G  |         Scheduled All-Cargo.         |
| L  |Nonscheduled Civilian Passenger/Cargo/|
| P  |     Nonscheduled Civilian Cargo.     |
| N  |Nonscheduled Military Passenger/Cargo.|
| R  |     Nonscheduled Military Cargo.     |

(2) Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first-class, coach, and mixed passenger/cargo service.

(3) Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.

(d) *Air transport traffic and capacity elements.* Within each of the service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic and capacity elements. The elements are reported on segment and/or market records as follows:

(e) These reported items are further described as follows:

(1) *Reporting period date.* The year and month to which the reported data are applicable.

(2) *Carrier, Carrier entity code.* Each air carrier shall report its name and entity code (a five digit code assigned by BTS that identifies both the air carrier and its entity) for its particular operations. The Office of Airline Information (OAI) will assign or confirm codes upon request. Such requests should be transmitted by e-mail to *T100.Support@DOT.gov.*

(3) *Service class code.* The service class codes are prescribed in section 298.45(c). In general, classes are divided into two broad categories, either scheduled or nonscheduled, where scheduled = F + G and nonscheduled = L + N + P + R.

(4) *Record type code.* This code indicates whether the data pertain to non-stop segment (record type S) or on-flight market (record type M).

(5) *Aircraft type code.* This code represents the aircraft types, as described in the BTS' Accounting and Reporting Directives.

(6) *Origin, Destination airport code(s).* These codes represent the industry designators. An industry source of these industry designator codes is the Official Airline Guide (OAG). OAI assigns codes, upon request, if not listed in the OAG.

(7) *110 Revenue passengers enplaned.* The total number of revenue passengers enplaned at the origin point of a flight, boarding the flight for the first time; an unduplicated count of passengers in a market.

(8) *130 Revenue passengers transported.* The total number of revenue passengers transported over a single flight stage, including those already on the aircraft from a previous flight stage.

(9) *140 Revenue passenger-miles.* Computed by multiplying the inter-airport distance of each flight stage by the number of passengers transported on that flight stage.

(10) *210 Revenue cargo tons enplaned.* The total number of cargo tons enplaned. This data element is a sum of the individual on-flight market figures for each of the following categories: 217 Freight and 219 Mail. This element represents an unduplicated count of the revenue traffic in a market.

(11) *217 Enplaned freight.* The total weight of revenue freight enplaned at the origin point of a flight, loaded onto the flight for the first time; an unduplicated count of freight in a market.

(12) *219 Enplaned mail.* The total weight of mail enplaned at the origin point of a flight, loaded onto the flight for the first time; an unduplicated count of mail in a market.

(27) *510 Revenue aircraft departures performed.* The number of revenue aircraft departures performed.

(28) *520 Revenue aircraft departures scheduled.* The number of revenue aircraft departures scheduled, whether or not actually performed.

(29) *610 Revenue aircraft hours (airborne).* The elapsed time, computed from the moment the aircraft leaves the ground until its next landing.

(30) *630 Aircraft hours (ramp-to-ramp).* The elapsed time, computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power from the boarding ramp at one airport to the time it comes to rest at the ramp for the next point of landing. This data element is also referred to as ‘block’ and ‘block-to-block’ aircraft hours.

(31) *650 Total aircraft hours (airborne).* The elapsed time, computed from the moment the aircraft leaves the ground until it touches down at the next landing. This includes flight training, testing, and ferry flights.

(f) *Public availability of Schedule T-100 data.* Detailed domestic on-flight market and nonstop segment data in Schedule T-100, except military data, shall be publicly available after processing. Domestic data are defined as data from air transportation operations from a place in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession to a place in any State of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, or a U.S. territory or possession.

Appendix to § 291.45 - Instructions to U.S. Air Carriers for Reporting Traffic and Capacity Data on Schedule T-100

(a) *Format of reports* - (1) *Automatic Data Processing (ADP) magnetic tape.* Refer to paragraph (d) of this appendix for instructions pertaining to mainframe and minicomputer reporting. The Department will issue “Accounting and Reporting Directives” to make necessary technical changes to these T-100 instructions. Technical changes which are minor in nature do not require public notice and comment.

(2) *Microcomputer diskette* - (i) *Optional specification.* If an air carrier desires to use its personal computers (PC's), rather than mainframe or minicomputers to prepare its data submissions, the following specifications for filing data on diskette media apply.

(ii) *Reporting medium.* Microcomputer ADP data submission of T-100 information must be on IBM compatible disks. Carriers wishing to use a different ADP procedure must obtain written approval to do so from the BTS Assistant Director - Airline Information. Requests for approval to use alternate methods must disclose and describe the proposed data transmission methodology. Refer to paragraph (i) of this appendix for microcomputer record layouts.

(iii) *Microcomputer file characteristics.* The files will be created in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by quotation marks (“) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition within a given record. Therefore, each record must contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. Personal computer software including most spreadsheets, data base management programs, and BASIC are capable of producing files in this format.

(b) *Filing date for reports.* The reports must be received at BTS within 30 days following the end of each reporting period.

(c) *Address for filing.* Data Administration Division, K-14, Office of Airline Information, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001.

(d) *ADP format for magnetic tape* - (1) *Magnetic tape specifications.* IBM compatible 9-track EBCDIC recording. Recording density of 6250 or 1600 bpi. The order of recorded information is:

(i) Volume label.

(ii) Header label.

(iii) Data records.

(iv) Trailer label.

(2) [Reserved]

(e) *External tape label information.* (1) Carrier name.

(2) Report date.

(3) File identification.

(4) Carrier address for return of tape reel.

(f) *Standards.* It is the policy of the Department to be consistent with the American National Standards Institute and the Federal Standards Activity in all data processing and telecommunications matters. It is our intention that all specifications in this application are in compliance with standards promulgated by these organizations.

(g) *Volume, header, and trailer label formats* - (1) *Use standard IBM label formats.* The file identifier field of the header labels should be “T-100.SYSTEM”.

(h) *Magnetic tape record layouts for T-100* - (1) *Nonstop segment record layout.*

(i) *Record layouts for microcomputer diskettes.* The record layouts for diskette are generally identical to those shown for magnetic tape, with the exception that delimiters (quotation marks, tabs and commas) are used to separate fields. It is necessary that the order of fields be maintained in all records.

(1) *File characteristics.* The files will be created in ASCII delimited format, sometimes called Data Interchange Format (DIF). This form of recording data provides for variable length fields (data elements) which, in the case of alphabetic data, are enclosed by quotation marks (“) and separated by a comma (,) or tab. Numeric data elements that are recorded without editing symbols are also separated by a comma (,) or tab. The data are identified by their juxtaposition within a given record. Therefore, it is critical that each record contain the exact number of data elements, all of which must be juxtapositionally correct. PC software including most spreadsheets, data base management programs, and BASIC produce minidisk files in this format.

(2) *File naming conventions for diskettes.* For microcomputer reports, each record type should be contained in a separate DOS file on the same physical diskette. The following DOS naming conventions should be followed:

(i) Record type S = SEGMENT.DAT

(ii) Record type M = MARKET.DAT
