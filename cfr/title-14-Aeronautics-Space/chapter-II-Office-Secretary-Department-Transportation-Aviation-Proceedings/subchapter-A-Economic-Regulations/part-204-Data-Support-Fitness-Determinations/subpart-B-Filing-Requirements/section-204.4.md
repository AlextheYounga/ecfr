##### ยง 204.4 Carriers proposing to provide essential air service. #####

Link to an amendment published at 84 FR 15925, Apr. 16, 2019.

Applicants proposing to provide essential air service have been divided into two categories, and are subject to differing data submission requirements as set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section. However, if a carrier has previously filed any of the required data with the Department or other Federal agency and they are available to the Department, and these data continue to reflect the current state of the carrier's fitness, the carrier may instead identify the data and provide a citation for the date and place of filing. All carriers may contact the Air Carrier Fitness Division to ascertain what information is already available to the Department and thus may not need to be resubmitted.

(a) Carriers who propose to begin or expand non-subsidized essential air service when the incumbent leaves the market must file the following information:

(1) All of the information required under ยง 204.3 of this part.

(iii) The carrier's plans for financing the acquisition or lease of such additional aircraft; and

(iv) A sworn affidavit stating that all such aircraft have been certified by the FAA and currently comply with all FAA safety standards.

(3) A description of the fuel available to perform the proposed essential air services and the carrier's contracts with fuel suppliers.

(6) A description of the average number of block hours each type of aircraft is currently flown per day.

(7) An estimate of the impact the proposed essential air service would have on the carrier's utilization of its aircraft fleet.

(8) A detailed schedule of the service to be provided, including times of arrivals and departures, the aircraft to be used for each flight, and the fares to be charged.

(9) A pro-forma income statement for the proposed operation for the first annual period.

(1) All of the information required under ยง 204.3 of this part.

(2) All of the information required under paragraph (a) of this section.
