##### § 221.105 Special notice of limited liability for death or injury under the Warsaw Convention. #####

(a)(1) In addition to the other requirements of this subpart, each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by the Warsaw Convention, shall, at the time of delivery of the ticket, furnish to each passenger whose transportation is governed by the Convention and whose place of departure or place of destination is in the United States, the following statement in writing:

Advice to International Passengers on Limitations of Liability

Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that the provisions of a treaty known as the Warsaw Convention may be applicable to their entire journey including the portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The Convention governs and in most cases limits the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury to approximately $10,000.

Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under the Warsaw Convention. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.

(2) Provided, however, That when the carrier elects to agree to a higher limit of liability to passengers than that provided in Article 22(1) of the Warsaw Convention, such statement shall be modified to reflect the higher limit. The statement prescribed herein shall be printed in type at least as large as 10-point modern type and in ink contrasting with the stock on:

(i) Each ticket;

(ii) A piece of paper either placed in the ticket envelope with the ticket or attached to the ticket; or

(iii) The ticket envelope.

(b) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by the Warsaw Convention, shall also cause to be displayed continuously in a conspicuous public place at each desk, station, and position in the United States which is in the charge of a person employed exclusively by it or by it jointly with another person, or by any agent employed by such air carrier or foreign air carrier to sell tickets to passengers whose transportation may be governed by the Warsaw Convention and whose place of departure or destination may be in the United States, a sign which shall have printed thereon the statement prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section: Provided, however, That an air carrier, except an air taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter, or foreign air carrier which provides a higher limitation of liability than that set forth in the Warsaw Convention and has signed a counterpart of the agreement among carriers providing for such higher limit, which agreement was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board by Order E-23680, dated May 13, 1966 (31 FR 7302, May 19, 1966), may use the alternate form of notice set forth in the proviso to § 221.106(a) of this chapter in full compliance with the posting requirements of this paragraph. And provided further, That an air taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter, which provides a higher limitation of liability than that set forth in the Warsaw Convention and has signed a counterpart of the agreement among carriers providing for such higher limit, which agreement was approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board by Order E-23680, dated May 13, 1966 (31 FR 7302, May 19, 1966), may use the following notice in the manner prescribed by this paragraph in full compliance with the posting requirements of this paragraph. Such statements shall be printed in bold faced type at least one-fourth of an inch high.
