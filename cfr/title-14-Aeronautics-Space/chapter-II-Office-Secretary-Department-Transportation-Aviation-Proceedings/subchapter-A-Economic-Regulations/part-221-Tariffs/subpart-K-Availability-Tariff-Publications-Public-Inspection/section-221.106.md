For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage unless a higher value is declared and an extra charge is paid. Special rules may apply for valuables. Consult your carrier for details.

(2) Provided, however, That an air carrier or foreign air carrier which provides a higher limitation of liability for death or personal injury than that set forth in the Warsaw Convention and has signed a counterpart of the agreement approved by the Civil Aeronautics Board by Order E-23680, dated May 13, 1966 (31 FR 7302, May 19, 1966), may use the following notice in full compliance with the posting requirements of this paragraph and of § 221.105(b):

Advice to Passengers on Limitations of Liability

Airline liability for death or personal injury may be limited by the Warsaw Convention and tariff provisions in the case of travel to or from a foreign country.

For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) liability for loss, delay or damage to baggage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage unless a higher value is declared and an extra charge is paid. Special rules may apply to valuable articles.

See the notice with your tickets or consult your airline or travel agent for further information.

(3) Provided, however, That carriers may include in the notice the parenthetical phrase “($20.00 per kilo)” after the phrase “$9.07 per pound” in referring to the baggage liability limitation for most international travel. Such statements shall be printed in bold-face type at least one-fourth of an inch high and shall be so located as to be clearly visible and clearly readable to the traveling public.

(b)(1) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of limitations of liability for loss of, damage to, or delay in delivery of, baggage shall include on or with each ticket issued in the United States or in a foreign country by it or its authorized agent, the following notice printed in at least 10 point type:

Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations

For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound for checked baggage and $400 per passenger for unchecked baggage unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid. Excess valuation may not be declared on certain types of valuable articles. Carriers assume no liability for fragile or perishable articles. Further information may be obtained from the carrier.

(2) Provided, however, That carriers may include in their ticket notice the parenthetical phrase “($20.00 per kilo)” after the phrase “$9.07 per pound” in referring to the baggage liability limitation for most international travel.

(c) It shall be the responsibility of each carrier to insure that travel agents authorized to sell air transportation for such carrier comply with the notice provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

(d) Any air carrier or foreign air carrier subject to the provisions of this section which wishes to use a notice of limited liability for baggage of its own wording, but containing the substance of the language prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may substitute a notice of its own wording upon approval by the Department.

(e) The requirements as to time and method of delivery of the notice (including the size of type) specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the requirement with respect to travel agents specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by the Department upon application and showing by the carrier that special and unusual circumstances render the enforcement of the regulations impractical and unduly burdensome and that adequate alternative means of giving notice are employed.

(f) Applications for relief under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be filed with the Department's Office of International Aviation not later than 15 days before the date on which such relief is requested to become effective.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no air taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter shall be required to give the notices prescribed in this section, either in its capacity as an air carrier or in its capacity as an agent for an air carrier or foreign air carrier.
